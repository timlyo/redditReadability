|-| cntsp53 || 7 || The right time to start looking for a literary agent?  Whenever it feels right.  **Submitting** to a literary agent: when you have a finished, polished product that is absolutely as good as you can make it. |-| 
|-| cntsppm || 21 || Ask yourself: Is your novel a finished product?

Which means: Is the story compelling? coherent? Did you polish it at your maximum ability? 

And also: is the style steady? engaging? Is your voice shining from it?

To finish: Did you edit it? Did you ask your spouse to check for errors? Plot, characters inconsistencies? Proofread? Spell-checked?

Do you believe that much in yourself that you're willingly to spend money on a professional editor to give it the shine it deserves? (Spoiler: if you don't believe in you, no one else will).

If you're positive with all of the above, you can start querying agent. But please, do yourself and the agents a favour; read the submission guidelines first. always!

good luck!

|-| cntvu43 || 4 || Ehhhh, kind of. The developers of the video-game 'S.T.A.L.K.E.R' had a short story competition on their website which I entered. Problem was it used a system where a user rated the story 1-10, and credibility soon collapsed under people using different IPs etc. Up until that point I was doing pretty well in the rankings, but the developers wouldn't change it as, understandably, they were too busy trying to make a game.

In the end they asked the forum moderator, who had been most active in the community, what his top 10 choices were. I was one of them and recieved a copy of the game signed by the developers. In a final twist of fate, though, they'd signed it on the reverse of the cover rather than over the cover in gold or silver pen. Ah well, it's still kinda nice!  |-| 
|-| cntw2p0 || 7 || In addition to what /u/weissblut has said about having a *finished* product, I will advocate going an extra mile that will take longer, but may ultimately help in your quest to land an agent.  

What sets a query letter apart from the hundreds that an agent gets that week?  (I'm not kidding- some of the agents I was submitting to were receiving *hundreds* of queries a week.)  

An excellent query letter, for starts.  The query critique thread is a huge, *huge* help and you should use it.  

An engaging premise *that is the right fit for that agent*.  Do your homework.  

And, the thing I'm advocating which will take the most time, but might actually be necessary in today's market: **short story credits**.  

Short story publications are basically a big flashing sign that says "See?  I can do this!  Someone else has already seen my work fit to publish!"  You will stand above the rest.

|-| cnty08m || 8 || For dialog, ~subtly setting that character up for punchlines helps quite a bit. Or in the case of dealing with well spoken characters letting your charmer hold his own in a battle of wits shows confidence. Having the character very quickly analyze someone's name and make a pun off it for example.

Smiling is nice, but the character should use that friendliness to take interest (even if just probing for information) in other characters and what is happening to them, remembering to use their name. This is much akin to teaching a boy to use a girl's name and ask about *her* on a date rather than to talk about himself.

A subtle thing you can have a charming character do is spread gossip in a sort of positive way:

&gt; "I've heard of this man... He's a full purse with a sharp blade to guard it." 

Meanwhile, you should condense what they have to say down to as few words as reasonably possible so that each word they say feels carefully chosen and not just thrown out on a whim.

Then for personality having layered vulnerabilities is helpful; for example they might mess up a particular social grace or action and laugh it off, but underneath they have a seething hate of a person/thing (ala Oberyn).

A key point I think is having all these great qualities and also having them want (or in the case of a villain appear to want) to be generous at heart, even if they don't always live up to that goal.

Lastly, being an underdog is helpful. This lets the character demonstrate tenacity and well-being in spite of his poor circumstances.

There is a thin line between being charming and pretentiousness, but I think it lies on weakness. You have to couple their charm with weakness so that the reader feels an inner desire to help the character succeed.

After all you can make any character in your book be enamored with the character, your goal is to charm the reader. |-| 
|-| cnty0s2 || 3 || It is hard to write a charming character without them coming across as smarmy or a Mary Sue. It is balancing charisma with friendliness in a way that is realistic.

If I had to write a character like that I would look up interviews with people known to be charismatic and charming like John F Kennedy, Robert Downey Jnr etc. Note what makes them stand out. Maybe compare them to other people and see the difference. Look at their body language, tone, facial expressions. 

Once you know what words and phrases came to mind as you watched, it will be easier to translate into what you are writing.

This is especially true with a quality like charm, which is predicated largely on non-verbal actions like inflection and body language; the reader's imagination will build the character around what you *suggest* they're like. |-| 
|-| cnu29yz || 4 || Well, it depends on how you want their weakness to feature. Since the weakness has to be (relatively) easily to conceal, and not immediately debilitating (or if it is, not obviously so):

**Is it a weakness that will be used to 'identify' them, but not actually render them helpless or at a severe disadvantage?**

*  **Hyper-coagulation:** They do not to bleed, regardless of the severity of the wound.

*  **Accelerated Dermal Defense:** They cannot be tatooed, for example. Any foreign matter introduced to their skin or organs is immediately expelled.

**Is it a weakness that will be exploited to destroy them?**

*  **Alcohol and / or drugs:** Greatly reduces their physical / mental faculties. However, they are able to process staggering amounts of other drugs and stimulants, and mask their weakness to alcohol by consuming ludicrous amounts of drugs. Aversion to alcohol is written off as a 'quirk'. Can also be reversed: they're famous alcoholics (albeit pretend-alcoholics), but are unable to process any kind of barbiturate or stimulant.

*  **High Pitched Frequencies**: They have an expanded spectrum of hearing, which makes them very sensitive to particularly high pitched sounds. These can disorient or cause them great pain, but are usually avoided through use of ear-plugs or something.

&gt; This is a tired, pointless passage, a dull description of an unbelievable fight. It lacks story, characters, pain. There is not even an impression of action or a sense of danger. Look at those verbs you have chosen: “threw”, “froze”, “grab”, “squeezed”, “looked”, “twisted”, “dropped”, “levelled”, “got”. They are the familiar first-thought choices of a hack writer, speedily typing words, filling up a page. Surely you should be aiming higher than that?

Compared with: "is" "lacks" "is" "look" "have chosen" "are" "typing" "filling" and "aiming?"

Surely verb choice demonstrates good writing...

I don't think I would care for the book. But, the reviewer didn't provide me with any perspective that helped me form that opinion. |-| 
|-| cnu81f0 || 3 || Indeed. It has to do with how we view success. If you talk to others of your project, you probably receive encouragement and praise from your family and friends. "That sounds very interesting!", "You're very creative!" You have justified the project in your mind and received good feelings about it. There's less need to actually complete the project since you've received praise without putting work in.

|-| cnu8fka || 4 || I think it would be all about the conflict. Does she turn down socializing events for fabricated reasons? Is she addicted to something? You can have strong conflict without much danger, you just need to make the reader feel her struggle. |-|

If I tell my parents, for example, that my draft is going well, they say, "That's great!" and the conversation moves on.  My roommate, however, who *loves* books, asks me what in particular I'm working on, why I'm excited about it, what I'm having trouble with, etc.  She also says that she's "excited to read it when it's done" - which obviously makes me want to finish.  It's super helpful to to have supportive, excited "fans" to keep you working even when things get hard, and they can be a useful sounding board for new ideas.  

Talking about your work can also *give* you ideas (even when a listener doesn't offer me any advice, I can usually talk my way to a solution - which wouldn't happen without them).  Writer friends can also make great competitors (you're halfway done?  Cool - I finished yesterday; try to keep up!) and can give great advice, too.

**TL;DR:** talking about my projects makes me excited and makes me work, because I've sought out the right people to listen. |-|

|-| cnuag8v || 4 || There is a poetry to great prose. There is more to telling a story than just the events that happen and the words that are spoken. To me, one of the great challenges of writing is "to write the gaps" - to *imply* without saying something directly, to make the reader infer and engage their imagination without necessarily looking like you're doing so. So much of any given piece is how you say something, more than what you say.

That doesn't mean that every sentence should be a poem in prose. The purpose of writing informs how it should be written; when I do academic or technical writing I generally aim at being very concise and direct. I do not want ambiguity, which is helpful in other kinds of writing. |-|

|-| cnucier || 5 || &gt; Do you strive to make your work great on a sentence by sentence basis?

Yes, but the amount and *kind* of work I put into sentences depends on the purpose of the project, as well as the stage I'm at in the writing.

**PURPOSE:** as /u/AncientHistory said, the *"purpose of writing informs how it should be written"*.  I write engineering documents for work, and I care a lot more about clarity than I do about "aesthetics" in those cases.  Similarly, I write flash fiction sentences a lot differently than I write novel sentences, because wordcount is so very limited.  I write dialogue a lot more carefully than I write narration, because dialogue isn't "my" default voice.  In some ways this is the same *amount* of work (I'm still tailoring almost every sentence), but the outcome is very different.

**STAGE:** for short works (e.g. flash fiction), I'm very aware of my sentences from the first draft.  For longer works, like novels, I don't give a crap about sentences until much later drafts.  If I wrote brilliant sentences from the beginning (er... assuming I'm some sort of wizard), it'd be a lot harder to rearrange/delete/change the story in a larger sense, as I wouldn't want to "ruin" all my hard work on the sentences.  It'd also take me a really long time to write anything.

&gt; Why?

Because the difference between good writing and bad writing, in my opinion, has a lot to do with sentences.  As a reader, I don't care if your sentences aren't beautiful, but I'll notice if you have a bunch of meanginless filler, silly adverbs or purple prose.  I'll notice if what you said isn't clear, or if you use a word incorrectly, and I'll notice these things probably while reading your blurb/excerpt.  Even if the story is great, I can already tell it's going to be a struggle to get through. |-| 
|-| cnuenp7 || 3 || It's the opposite for me, my hand cramps up and can't keep up with the words in my head. It is unfortunate because most of my ideas fade out before I can get them down unless I already have a blank document open to type into. |-|

Anyway, you already have the answer figured out:

&gt;I've been writing more and more about the universe, brainstorming ideas, and trying to develop some actual plot to it for maybe six months.

This is exactly how you do it. There's no secret recipe when it comes to writing stories. It's all about hard work. You will find it is the same mantra when it comes to drawing, too. Start small with faint lines and basic shapes, and carefully flesh it out with more intricate details as you go.

It's all about swallowing your fears and taking one step after another. If you feel overwhelmed, then break it apart into several smaller pieces that you can string together into something larger when you're ready for it. 

It will take a lot of planning.

|-| cnv2cly || 3 || It depends if you're published or not, and fiction or not.

Unpublished fiction? It's happened, but that's literally down to million to one odds. Buy a lottery ticket, you've got much better odds of getting $10,000 to get you out of a sticky situation.

Unpublished nonfiction? Generally they do proposals first, so writing it would be jumping the gate. However, yeah you can if you find an agent or publisher that likes the idea. It's still a hard press as an unpublished author, especially if you don't have field expertise--a neurologist will get handed an advance for a book on neuroscience, you won't.

If you're published, then for fiction yeah if you can outline good. For nonfiction, you're more likely to get a good advance, but odds aren't going to be hugely better for getting published if you're just randomly targeting niches. |-| 
|-| cnv2d7i || 7 || Ok to start with, you will most likely ruin them. It will happen get over it. You write a thing, and then you'll look at it. It will be crap, you might even consider burning it just to hide the evidence that it ever existed. At this point you can either give up, or try again. If you give up game over, the end. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200. But if you try again, then you can make something new. If you learned anything the first time around the urge to burn it will be less. 

Take me for instance I've been trying to get good a writing since march. I just recently wrote something that for the first time I didn't cringe inside when showing it to other people. I have ideas, and while I know I can't yet do them justice, I won't ruin them if I put them down on paper. Don't ask us to find you confidence all we can do is give B.S. motivational speeches.

|-| cnv2h1i || 12 || I'm a nerd about names -- I just love them in general, so I'm always paying attention to them. 

I have a list in the notes on my phone (that's what I use to keep the lsit since I almost always have it with me) of names that I either think of or that I hear and like. It's literally titled "name list" and I add a name to it whenever one catches my attention or whenever I hear a word that might make a nice name in particular sorts of stories. 

For this to work, you'll have to pay attention to names in general. You'll also have to have a "taste" for them -- this works for me because names all feel different to me in my mouth and strike different parts of my brain. If "Susie" and "Persephone" or even "Susie" and "Sally" don't cause different feelings in your mouth and mind, this sort of listing would probably be fruitless. 

www.behindthename.com is a great resource for name lists + the etymologies of those names. 

Looking up meaning first can also be helpful. Names have all sorts of fascinating histories and meanings.

Looking through baby name books is fun. That's how my name obsession started when I was a kid. 

If your character was born in a particular year, you can look up what the most popular names in their country in that year were. 

Here are some ideas of things to pay attention to for name potential:

*mythologies

*religious texts

*geographical names (towns, cities, rivers, mountains, etc.)

*words that are just pretty. Remember, these are fictional characters, you don't have to worry about them getting made fun of in school if their name is unusual (though don't make all the names unusual unless there's a truly compelling reason for the story).

*historical figures

*names that sound plain but, on further examination, are actually fresh because of the very fact that they've fallen out of favor. This is why suddenly names like Emma, Sophia, Isabella, Pearl, etc. became fresh again. Right now, for this purpose, I love Jane. 

*names from literature

*names from the phone book (well, if you can get your hands on a phone book)

*names of people you encounter

*names of people's families (I have been known to ask people about any interesting names from their family tree)


If you're going to choose a very common name, choose one that isn't too trendy or too anchored in just one decade unless there's a reason to do otherwise. John is a common name but it's not really a cliche -- it's a classic. Jaden is *not* a classic. If you're writing science fiction on the other side of the universe or fantasy set in medieval times or something about young hipsters you'll have a lot of leeway. If you're writing something about the inhabitants of a typical suburb, you'll want a good amount of non-trendy common names + a few trendy ones thrown in based on the age of the characters (ie based on what was trendy when the character was born).

When naming people's children, decide what sort of name that fictional parent would find appealing. Some people name all their kids really trendy names and others would feel ill at the thought; some people like unusual names and others don't want their child to have a reason to be singled out. Some want to use family names and others hate their family and would never want reminders. You get what I mean. 

The most annoying thing is when I see names that don't match the context. A lot of beginning writers choose names like Susie for sixteen-year-olds in 2015. If they had a reason, that would be one thing, but it happens so often that I feel pretty sure they're just picking whatever "See Spot Run" worthy name first popped into their head without any regard for setting, time, place, context, etc. 

One thing some of my fellow name nerdy friends do: write down lists of names of whoever they meet in any particular situation. They will give you a feel for how common various names are, how diverse the names are or aren't, what kind of people have the names, etc. 

(Mostly unrelated note: I also write down potential band names and potential book titles whenever I think of them. They needn't be attached to anything or inspired by anything. I just keep a list and then eventually I might need one for a story. Truly good titles are hard to come by.) |-|

|-| cnv36pa || 3 || Writing is like anything else, you have to do it in order to get better at it. Your first stories are not going to live up to the expectations you have in your mind, because words, no matter how well you string them together, are going to be an imperfect representation of what's going on inside your head. The trick is to keep writing, and keep finishing things, so that eventually, the gap between the words on the page and the image in your head shorten.

GO forth and write. Finish what you start, and then go work on something else. Examine what you've written. Don't kill your confidence trying to rewrite your early work, just work on applying your observations to your next projects. |-| 
|-| cnv3tl9 || 3 || I write fantasy so I have a bit of leeway here, but what I generally do is think about the real-world cultural influences on the fantasy cultures in my stories, then derive names that use common roots and sounds without being direct rip-offs of actual-world names.

It's a lot like naming babies in today's upper-middle-class white america, actually.  Everyone wants that distinctive-sounding, ethnically appropriate but not-too-common name for their kid.  I just treat all my characters like they're my children, except some of my children might be ancient roman, some middle-eastern and some french jews. |-|

Also cemeteries are very peaceful places to just take a walk and think anyway.  |-|

Thing about college, though, is you meet a lot of people who want to do the same thing you want to do. Later on, you help each other out sometimes by being a support network and sharing contacts. 

I think you should stay in school. Writing full time is nice and all, but think about it: do you really write for 8 hours a day? I bet even on a productive day you're only producing for an hour or two at best.

The issue I've always had with cocaine, however, is the idea of snorting it up your nose as a concentrated powder.  I mean, wouldn't ANY drug be ridiculously dangerous/potent in that scenario?  What if people started doing that with caffeine?  Instead of getting an extra-large coffee from Starbucks, they order 300 mg of caffeine powder and snort it up their nose in the bathroom stall.  That would be crazy, right?!  (And probably very unhealthy).

I really wish I could try cocaine in a more natural form (i.e. chewing the coca leaves or making tea from them).  I don't need to get completely 'fucked up' on it - I just want enough to give my day a little boost.  Like a cup of coffee. |-|

If the writer doesn't have a good grasp of spelling or grammar or sentence structure, it sounds...wrong. Like a non-English speaker trying to string sentences together, or someone that nominally knows English but doesn't actually know all the definition of all the words they're using and the different parts of speech, so it comes across as a high school student trying to sound more intelligent than they are.

If the writer doesn't have a good grasp of narrative, you get a different kind of bad writing. Events tend to be told chronologically, from a single (even first-person) perspective, and read like a list of events. The writing tends to lack poetry, the "story" is missing, the characters are flat and unaffected. Alternately, the prose turns from purple to ultra-violet; adjectives get strung together, metaphors clog together, and the simplest act or fact is expressed in the most complicated, and often silly way. Like some people think H. P. Lovecraft or William Faulkner writes, but don't actually know what they're talking about.

Then you've got the single-skill writing. These are people that have a fairly strong skill at writing *an* aspect of narrative, but nothing else, so they drop it. Usually this is what you get from screenplay-writers who focus on dialogue to the exclusion of action and background, or alternately who focus on action beats and don't do any world building, hoping explosions make up for a lack of plotting.

Even if you can write complete sentences and paragraphs, and are able to write coherent dialogue and descriptions, plotting and pacing are still common failings. So you can get writing which *looks* good, but the plot is stale or the pacing nonexistent, and you end up in one of those stories that either turns into a complete slog or ends up making no damn sense, with a terrible wrap-up ending because the writer wrote themselves into a corner.

Then you get that very special kind of bad writing, the potboiler. It's the kind of thing where the person writing it could and probably should do better; it's lazy, trite, facile, and padded with extraneous descriptions. It has about enough plot and ideas for one kick-ass good story, but it's bloated to be an entire book and then you find out it's the start of a trilogy. You tend to see a lot of soap opera tropes creep in, and mid-list authors go for this kind of thing when they just need to get paid. Romance novelists pump them out as a matter of course. Dan Brown comes to mind. It's not that pot boilers need be bad, and often they're competent if not exactly awe-inspiring, but they're flavorless and formulaic like the 33rd Doc Savage novel.

Purposeful bad writing is usually reserved for writers that are deliberately taking the piss out of a bad idea, or people with less talent than reputation who are trying to pass it off as being ironic. You see this in cheesy exploitation novels, screenplays like *Grindhouse*, and people trying to consciously copy Jack Kerouac or Hunter S. Thompson; there's a deliberate aesthetic they're trying to invoke, but there's an edge of desperation or soul or drugs or talent missing, so all it does is remind how much better the original is instead of this copy-of-a-copy. |-|

I'll read just about anything and not hate it. But at the risk of sounding like an old grouch, I really don't like sentiment. I don't like writers who write in an overstated way or dwell on one thing for too long. It feels like listening to someone who is explaining their own joke. I like writing where the negative space often says more than the words.

But probably my least favorite is when the author's opinions or desires take over the story. When all the protagonists unanimously agree on a topic, and anyone who disagrees is a flat strawman villain existing only to be verbally eviscerated by the good guys. When the story gets abruptly derailed so that all the MCs can have a somber moment about saving the environment or deliver a speech about capitalism. When the protagonist is a young brooding author reflecting on life, with long paragraphs dedicated to "his" philosophies.

They did at least one 15 minute writing prompt every meeting and let each one read their story aloud. I didn't think I could do that, but surprised myself that I did and it wasn't bad.  I then used one of my prompts and made an entire story out of it. It's being edited now. I literally surprised myself at every turn.  |-|

|-| cnvrduh || 3 || I had a similar problem with a short story, which made my characters flat and uninteresting. In order to overcome this, you must know your people well, and a good way to find this is through a Backstory: write whatever events or things that have defined that persons life, and shaped them through history. Character bibles are also good to have (especially if writing a series) but are more tedious than Backstory . If you still don't get the what or why of your characters, just ask them yourself.psychoanalyze them, shape them from the mold of your imagination, and they get boring, add something fresh to their personalities/motives

|-| cnvsqyr || 7 || At the novel length, you really get to know them as you write.  Which is cool, because sometimes they do unexpected things at the start, that even you didn't know about.  I find this holds true up until you dip under 20k words.  It's just hard to define characters in 20k words and it really becomes more of a storytelling telling problem, then character development.  At this length if you want well defined characters, they need to go thought a lot of defining trails, asap.  Kinda like a season of 24 :P   

If you personally want to get to know them, before you write, just create short stories about your characters.  Could be lame ones, like how Bill takes a shower or really exciting ones, like how Bill kills and rapes.  That's up to you.  Though I'm already not trusting Bill.

|-| cnxi07v || 3 || A good dev editor, or writing group, or even friends typically can help.  The nice thing about plots is just about everybody likes to talk about them, and can help with them.  We love movies, shows, books, etc.  There is no shortage of people who love this topic, so for sure get talking to people.  

The best way I find, to really develop a plot, is more so to develop a message.  Maybe you want to tell the world that love isn't fair.  Then you work backwards building a story that portrays this.  King this, King that, I hate to even use him as an example, if he just wasn't so dam good at writing.  Anyway, King was talking in an interview, about how some woman ran over another woman on the news, and he was like, I'm gonna write about this, so he did.  Also, he abandon Under the Dome for a while, because it was just too much.  The point being, everybody struggles with this stuff. 

Sometimes we have this one great scene, then the rest is crap.  Sometimes we have this great big idea, that we fill up with crappy scenes.  The most important part is really that you try.  If it's big plots you are bad at, write a 1 page plot summary every day for a book that doesn't exist.  Fairly quickly I would imagine, you'll be good at it.  Since most ppl do a novel a year-ish, it's a skill you rarely drill.  So drill it, drill it to death.  Like snowboarding, theory is great, till you eat the snow.  Same here, if you don't do it till you are sick of it, your brain won't get good at it.

|-| cnxyup0 || 5 || It's easier to walk to the fridge than to walk to the store. It's easier to walk to the store than to walk across town. It's easier to walk across town than to walk to another city. If someone told you to walk across the country, a trip to the store suddenly doesn't seem so bad.

Plots are the easiest thing in the world. Unless of course you see writing long stories as a long and difficult journey. Do you? Do you at least somewhere deep down inside? Are you looking at a full-length novel like somebody asking you to walk all the way across the country when a trip to the store is challenge enough?

Our brains can be lazy at times. We have a natural tendency to conserve energy, even mental energy. This is why we see a big text wall, and our brains just go "nope..." How much more daunting is the idea of writing an entire novel, with all the twists and turns and machinations of plot, and multiple characters.

Get a book of assorted puzzles. Make a commitment to finish every puzzle in the book. Even the ones that are boring or difficult. Don't peek at the answers in the back. Work on it every day until it's done. Why? Because your brain needs to be able to walk to the store and back, even if it doesn't want to. And if it can walk to the store and back, it can walk all the way across the country some day.

Get a bag of M&amp;M's. Sit down to sketch out a plot for a full-length novel. Write very vague, point-form notes. Explain the story to yourself the way a buddy would when he's telling you about a movie he saw. Every time you finish a scene, reward yourself with a couple of M&amp;M's. Yum. I'm pretty sure that before long you'll completely forget about the candy and just be excited about the plot. People think writing an outline kills the creative process, but really, it is the creative process. It's the mental equivalent of an architect designing a building. He starts with rough sketches and slowly adds more detail. Finally, he's got a detailed plan. And all this is done before the very first nail is hammered in.

The writing will be easy once you've got a full outline. You basically just have to fill in the blanks. You just have to build the building you designed. You'll always be excited about the scenes and how they tie in to the overall story line, and you won't feel like you're wandering blindly in the dark.

But first you've gotta walk to the store. |-| 
|-| cnxza9q || 3 || Probably a good idea!

I found it pretty interesting. I wouldn't mind seeing this in action with my own work.

|-| cobdlfg || 12 || I've found that how I feel while writing often has no correlation to the quality of my work.

Some of my best scenes have been produced over the course of 3-4 days' worth of slogging through a max of 400-500 words per day, and some of my most "productive" days in terms of wordcount result in long editing sessions to fix what I thought at the time was brilliant writing. |-| 
|-| cobb7e6 || 4 || For me it just seems to depend on how much stress I have at the time. If I know I am writing an exam tomorrow (like yesterday...) I am going to write much less in the same amount of time and I am way more critical of what I write. To me, most of what I write seems pretty bad to me, both from a writing and a story point. But it's not like I can't write. And I don't think it's that much worse either.

I usually have my phone with me when I am outside of my mouse to note down any spontaneous idea I get from inspiration. While I haven't used any of them yet, I have collected a ton of unrefined material I could use. Maybe having ideas like that in advance could help you if you feel out of creative ideas. There is also /r/WritingPrompts if you just want to write

I think everyone has days where he can write much more and feels like he writes much better (which may or may not be true) compared to other days. This is normal. There are probably so many factors influencing it that it borders on infinity. Health, healthy food, happiness, sadness, anger, worries, the list goes on.

But I don't think they influence your writing that much. If you just sit down and try to write for more than 5 minutes, you will most likely get ideas. Even if they are stupid, go write them out. Go continue your story. You can always rewrite those ideas, and these ideas you have written, stupid they may be, might lead you to significantly better ideas which you wouldn't have found without it.

I usually write an hour. I feel like after writing for that time, my "creative energy" goes down and it's getting less and less fun to write. So I usually stop then. At some days it's already before I start writing the case, at other days after 30 minutes. I don't think my attitude is the best one, and I am still looking for ways to fix it, but if you are writing for fun and don't have much time anyway, it help you. But I always write, every day, for at least 20 minutes. No matter if what I write is complete crap or not. |-|

|-| cob51kr || 11 || I have a pretty big place in my heart for King because his books really got me into reading when I was too young to have any business reading horror books.  

The common complaint about the endings of some of his stories is one that I find valid.  But when I'm in one of his books, I feel like I'm having a good time reading.  The pace is (usually) good, and I don't feel like I'm continuing to turn pages just to finish something I started.  So even when I don't like how a book ends, I really never feel disappointed in the experience of reading the story.

 |-| 
|-| cob63r4 || 7 || I love Stephen King. I've had to "go easy" with his books because I scare so easy, but I will say I have a tremendous respect for his writing ability. 

One of the things he does so well is NOT RUSH. He takes no shortcuts, and he is really (wonderfully) hard on his characters.

I remember in particular, one gut-wrenching scene in "Bag of Bones," where there was a drive-by shooting of sorts. What another writer would do in a paragraph and a half, King took pages and pages and pages to work through. It wasn't just "shots fired, victims hurt," blah blah. It just kept building. Now one of the victims shoots out a car tire, and the car catches fire. The shooter escapes, but comes back to finish the job, to kill the rest of the victims. Two of them manage to disarm him, but the strong one is losing blood fast and may pass out at any time, so they have to tie up the shooter NOW, before it's too late, and they need to find duct tape, but oh no the baby daughter just woke up from her nap and oh God oh God she's going to see her mother dead on the lawn, and where the hell is the duct tape!? On and on and on. The tension and plot were pulled so tight through the entire thing, that you felt like you couldn't breathe until it was over. I've never found another writer who could do this as well as King. I've read this particular passage at least six times, but today I'm actually shaking, remembering the tension and anxiety he built in that moment.

Nothing comes "easy" to King's characters. The reason I know how hard it is to bury a dead body is from reading his books, and watching his characters meet obstacle after painstaking obstacle. Another writer would just say, "drag the body, dig a hole," glossing over any potential difficulties, but not King. Oh no, if something can go wrong, it's going to, and on the way he'll imagine eight more problems to encounter. With King you find out exactly how cumbersome a dead body is, and how easily a shovel can break on frozen ground. You will find out that disposing of a corpse can take eight hours and leave you exhausted and weeping and probably heaving your lunch. 

Yes, I'll agree with the others here that his endings leave a LOT to be desired. But I don't read King for the endings. I read them for the glorious beginnings and in betweens.  |-| 
|-| cob4wvs || 9 || I like King.

He writes popular fiction and he knows it.  And that's fine.

He's not trying to be Faulkner or Joyce or Hemingway.  

My only complaint would be the standard one, which is that I tend to dislike his endings.

That being said I read and enjoy most of his books.

Edit:  I also love how much he can make me hate his antagonists. |-| 
|-| cob5ivp || 11 || I don't really have a problem with his books, but some of the writers here treat him as a godsend. He's alright, a journeyman, does adequate work. Nothing more, nothing less.


I think a lot of people are also tired of 'On Writing' as a book suggestion and 'The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed' as the consummation of a perfect line. You hang around here long enough and you see them thousands and thousands of times. On Writing is alright, the gunslinger line is alright, just like my summary of the man above. |-| 
|-| cob68kh || 6 || He's the best of the middlebrow writers.  He aims for the vast general Western audience, hits the subconscious is fairly obvious ways, and spins a pretty good yarn.  His early stuff is white-hot horror writing, his later stuff is hit and miss, and his middle work (late 80s to early 90s) is this big bland bore, with a couple of exceptions.  As far as mass market authors go, he's certainly better than James Patterson or Dan Brown, et al.  Most books that you see in a drug store bookrack make me put them down two chapters in because the writing is stilted and aimed at people with a ninth grade education.  King aims higher than that, and a lot of the time I actually really enjoy reading his voice - it's comfortable and it flows well.  His plots work, his characters have some dimension to them (most of the time, heh), and while he's famous for terrible endings I've never found them offensively bad.

He knows his business and he knows his audience - The American People™ - so he's been an unstoppable industry for decades.  This is part of the reason that people get so defensive about him.  They've grown up with his voice as their main window onto the literary world, and it becomes so comfortable and familiar that any perceived attack on it becomes akin to an attack on an old friend or family member.  

Do I think he's one of the Great Writers?  Not really, but his prolific success has ensured that he'll be remembered long after the works of DeLillo, Ballard, Franzen, et al. have been relegated to the dusty corners of some literary archive.   |-| 
|-| cob52h4 || 5 || The tallest tower is the one you throws stones at.

People say he's not a good writer, as if fundamentally, he's middle of the road in terms of putting a sentence together. He's an excellent, prolific writer, opinion not considered. Some people might not like his stories, some of his elements, characters, or endings, but this doesn't make someone a bad writer. If you're not I to classic music, it doesn't make Mozart shitty.

I dig his work. I consider myself well read, in terms of classic literature and contemporary fiction. Even if I am not blown away by one of his endings, they always resonate with me, and make me think.  I will often have internal debates for years after I finish one of his books.

Anyone who thinks the end of Dark Tower sucked missed the boat. Highly allegorical, profoundly cyclical, and really an impressive feat of writing - 8 books, he pulled off the biggest plot twists, and some people just didn't get it.

 |-| 
|-| cob9we4 || 3 || I think King is great. I only have one beef with him: Sadie in 11.22.63. She was pure male fantasy personified, with 'cute clumsiness' added to give her a 'flaw'.

A beautiful married virgin in her mid twenties just waiting to have her first time with the main character? Feeling no pain whatsoever during the act and having the perfect orgasm on the first try? Oh, she's also agile and quick to learn. And of course insatiable, otherwise she wouldn't be the perfect male fantasy. Her clumsiness ceases to be a character trait whenever she dances or is in bed.

I love King, but I wanted to have a word with him about that one. |-| 
|-| cobt7bx || -3 || King has a pedestrian outlook on life. He views the world from the ground level. He grew up on television cartoons, comic books, and rock and roll. He ate junk food. He didn't spend his time thinking abstractly, or philosophically. He has the mind of a peasant. So it's no surprise that he writes like a peasant. He writes skillfully, cleverly, smoothly, even elegantly, but he writes like a peasant. You won't find Great Thoughts in his books. You won't be challenged intellectually. You won't find anything really fresh or original or new, either. King recycles. His books are junk food for the brain. |-|

|-| cobk9ll || 6 || Years ago I read an opinion piece by an editor with one simple statement that struck me to my core: that writers, real writers, can't NOT write. If you *can* "not write," then don't. 

I realized at that moment that I can very easily not write. At the time I was heavily involved doing freelance editing for a couple dozen friends I'd met online on a website dedicated to such things, and I loved it. In fact, I loved it so much I hadn't bothered to contribute anything myself to be edited, even though I'd been asked to repeatedly. 

And I certainly know authors who CAN'T "not write." For these people (even the less talented of them), the writing is an unstoppable itch, a craving that HAS to be indulged daily, or they would lose their minds. So I thought, I'll leave the writing to them. I love the writing craft, but maybe I'm going about it the wrong way. I can edit, and at least contribute that way. 

Maybe that's cowardly of me. Editing is easier than creating. I don't know. But I haven't reached the point where I regret it yet, either. Because I *can* write, I'd always put pressure on myself to do so. It was kind of a relief to stop doing that, and realize that maybe *everyone* can write, but only a few cannot NOT write. |-| 
|-| cobtzpj || 4 || You can not become what you already are. |-| 
|-| cobk4dx || 3 || Depends on what you mean. I realized I would never be a full-time freelance writer when I got my first check (about six months after it was due); I'm fond of eating and had no desire to live paycheck-to-paycheck. I realized I *could* be a full-time technical writer when I landed my first contracted tech writing gig, but it was a long way from where I wanted to be doing as a writer. |-| 
|-| cobnxfh || 3 || There's also something to be said for recognizing the difference between loving something as a hobby and loving something so much you want to do it for the rest of your life.  I enjoy painting and singing and trying to play guitar, but I don't love any of those things to put in the time and effort necessary to get even remotely competent at them. So I do them for fun.  

There seems to be this really weird lack of middle ground in writing that doesn't exist in other endeavors.  You can program for fun or play football for fun or play in a local band without having any aspirations of it becoming something more.  But with writing it's all or nothing.  Either you're writing to publish or not doing it at all.  Why is it so bad to write as a hobby with no expectations?  |-|

|-| cobc6wt || 4 || Hey, Saw your post and it's got my attention! I once wrote a screenplay that got the interest of one producer, but none of his partners... It was a rejection and a huge downer. Then, a few years ago, I wrote a book for my niece. She was 10 years old at the time. I posted a copy of it on amazon for 0.99 for my friends to download. It was just the easiest way to disseminate a 25k word story. My friends all downloaded it and a couple dozen random strangers too, i got a few good reviews, and that was it. It went without selling a single for two years. but you know something... it didn't matter :) because I wrote for an audience of one, my niece. She loved it, it's still on her bookshelf. I don't care if another soul besides her reads it again. 
The point is If you are writing for positive critical response or commercial success, chances are you will most likely be disappointed. Most people are. its just the odds. The key to writing without failure is to write for an audience of one. Just one person. Speak to them like your words on the page can be heard like the words from your mouth and that effect can resonate as you speaking to any-ONE. It might not guarantee fame or fortune, but it should help with the much more important concept of fulfillment which is far more gratifying than a collection of critical praise.
Don't hate your work. It could be brilliant. Write for someone. Heck, pick a friend, or a family member, or a writing partner. Sit them down in front of you and read your best. You might discover some fluidity along the way... You'll hate your work less and love your work more, even if it's not perfect. You'll love writing just a little bit more.

Watch out for those moments when you think, "Oh, that person on the bus might have a really interesting life story" or when you have an emotional memory from your childhood and just try to write, like, 50 words or 100 words about that; don't try to force yourself into a regular writing discipline until you're actually able to do this pretty often and without the feeling of forcing yourself to do something arduous. 

Try to learn how to talk back to the negative voices in your head, or to become aware of them and then let them go. Usually I tell myself "You're not doing this to become famous or rich or successful; you're doing this to explore, and to learn things about writing," but it's different for everybody because you have to find something that you can really believe. 

One of the big things for me, with depression, is that I would make really certain plans to write THREE HOURS!!! on Saturday and then I would get mad at myself if I couldn't manage that. So I try to make my goals much smaller now, and pat myself on the back even if I just write three hundred words.  |-|
