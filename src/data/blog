First let me say what I have heard:

I hear conservatives say it is an attempt to control the internet while liberals seem to say that it is an attempt to take away control of the internet from corporations. The liberals seem to say that internet speed can be controlled depending on the web site; however, I have never noticed on site going slower/faster than another. Also, they seem to say that this is basically all it would do, and conservatives act like they would put a freakin tax on your MBs. 

Note: I am not liberal nor conservative so please do not make this a political argument. I only put in political labels as these are the nice boxes I have stuffed the opinions I have heard into. Someone help my dumb ass understand! |-|

The internet as it is is great. Seriously, one of my most favorite things ever. I can't imagine not being show to use it freely in the sense that I do now.

I'm drunk as shit but I'm about to call these guys. I dunno what to expect or what to say so I guess I'm going to say to them the same shit I just said in this post.

|-| cnq4uhc || 14 || As someone who just finished interning for a congressional office, here's my take on calling the office:

Sending mail, calling, and sending emails will more than likely be sorted in the same manner.  If you do this, they will write down your concerns and log it into a system. The system then sorts it and gives it to the legislative assistant that deals with this issue, and every week or so they send out HR letters that follow a basic format.  The congressman does follow what your thoughts and beliefs are, and will do their best to vote in the favor of his/her district. Your phone calls will 99% go to the intern, and they will pass it to the LA. If you call a representative from another district, you won't get a response, and they won't be able to log your concerns.  

Take that how you will, if calling is all you are able to do, then by all means call, but I would do more than that if this issue means a lot to you.  |-|

If this goes thru and is not vetoed (or whatever) by congress &amp; senate will this decrease internet bills? I pay $150 a month for satellite internet (no I cannot get DSL) but someone that lives 1/2 mile from me is able to get DSL internet for $30 a month. 

So what will this bill (or whatever it is) do to change the cost on internet.  |-|

 * Received hand written letter from Mrs. Donald Smith, 73 who explained she is in favor of the free market and dislikes it when the government regulates companies.
 * Received phone call from Mrs. Donald Smith, 73, following up on her letter.  She also scheduled an appointment to see the Senator for March 12, 2015 to discuss her concerns.

|-| cnq6jzu || 3 || I had the oddest three talks, and then ohanian didn't pick up.

First call: 
Hello, ____'s office, how my I help?


Hey there, so basically I was calling for you to pass on my message to ___. Could you please tell him that I believe congress should refrain from overturning any FCC decisions about net neutrality. I support this cause and just hope that it helps. Thanks

I was met with an awkward silence, and the man started asking me what I was talking about. I quickly googled some stuff  and informed him more. I realized he probably wouldn't tell ____ any of it, but I told him anyway. Basically he didn't understand most of it and he didn't know, but he passed on my message. 


On the second call it was for a female congress person, and the man who picked up started arguing with me. He told me I was wrong, but that he would pass on my message (I doubt he did or will).


The third call was just stupid. A man picked up and literally said his greetings, and then the second I said FCC he said they had received enough calls about net neutrality and then he hung up.



Then Alex (Alexis?) Didn't pick up |-|

|-| cnq73po || 10 || I'm a developer who cares very much about an open Internet. However, I'm not sold on net neutrality.

We presently use an Internet without net neutrality legislation, and it's held up pretty well. With few exceptions maybe, the Internet is neutral. ISP's could muck about with pricing tiers -- and maybe they will experiment -- but they have not done so en masse without the law restricting them.

We all know what goes on in Congress, and this seems like the camel's nose. Once there's a law imposing restrictions, it's much easier to broaden it later. I'll go out on a limb and say the big money companies (ISP's, big media, the up-and-coming streaming media companies, etc.) will be the ones financing their interests on Capitol Hill, and not so much the consumers like you and me.

I think too often these well intentioned ideas have unintended consequences. I'm fearful that this one would lead to poor results by opening the door for companies to use government against us, in typical Washington style.

The better preventative measure, I believe, is to remove barriers to new competition in the ISP market. Currently, public money subsidizes ISP's in some cases, which unfairly disadvantages others. As long as consumers have choices among ISP's, I think they'll be in much more control than if they hand this off to the failure that is Congress.

|-| cnqeqgj || 106 || Few points here from an intern who answers these calls (Office of a House member):

* If you leave a voicemail with your district rep., please leave your name and address so we can log it into our system. A lot of House offices have a policy of not logging non-constituent callers, so PLEASE confirm you're in our district with your address. This also means if you're calling and you get a person on the other line, but you're not in that office's district, they'll be cordial and nice but your message will not be entered in the system.

* We're here to serve you, so don't be afraid to call in and there's also no attitude required either to get your point across. You'll probably speak to an intern, and if they're like me, they'll agree with you on a personal level and be happy to take down your information. There are plenty of clueless interns out there, but it's their job to dutifully take down your statement that you SUPPORT Net Neutrality and the re-classification of broadband as a Title II Utility. That's all you really need to say, although you might as well oppose CISPA while you're on the line.

* Lastly, THESE CALLS MATTER. DO IT. CALL IN. IT'S REALLY, REALLY EASY. The phones NEED to be flooded to make a real difference here. It's one thing to get 5-6 calls about it throughout the day, that's great and everything, but, you should try and make our office (actually, just the front desk really) a living hell for a few hours to the extent that multiple Chiefs of Staff throughout the offices are confronted with the issue directly and immediately. At worst, it will strengthen the clout of the issue in the eyes of those who make these important decisions. At best, you could change your Congressman into a true advocate of the people. (ha!)

The voices of lobbyists/interests are in the ears of staffers all day, everyday. The only way for the citizens of this country to cancel that out is to FLOOD the phones with these calls. If you want this push to succeed there is no reward in half-assing this effort. MAKE THE CALL! |-|

This will be my first piece of reddit gear, I don't know what I'm gonna do to it yet but I know it's going straight on my desk at work. |-| 
|-| co92z21 || 13 || Impulse buy... 

Need this for my desk. It's like saying "don't tell me what you found on the internet today because I've probably already seen it." |-| 
|-| co92s45 || 39 || /r/cummingonfigurines is excited I bet.  |-| 
|-| co935ko || 5 || How big are they? Like 3" tall? |-| 
|-| co91lho || 10 || After hearing Alexis say reddit was started in 2005 on /r/upvoted, i was wondering what they were gonna do for the 10th anniversary. Hoping for more than this i guess? |-| 
|-| co92a4p || 9 || Awesome, i want one of these now |-| 
|-| co919i2 || 13 || Pretty cool. There are some pretty creative members of this community so it should be fun to see what people come up with. |-| 
|-| co92pmt || 12 || I'm going to buy one and make it my friend :') |-| 
|-| co91jix || 9 || Awesome! I was considering 3d printing a [model I made of a Snoo](http://i.imgur.com/YmMtC39.jpg?1) not too long ago. This is a way cheaper option |-| 
|-| co92yo7 || 4 || As a huge vinyl toy fan (shoutout to /r/kidrobot and /r/vinyltoys!), this made my entire day. 

It would make my entire month if you guys were able to replicate our snoovitars in vinyl.  |-| 
|-| co93dju || 4 || I bought one, but this is not how I intend to celebrate reddit's 10 year anniversary. Let's just say GrMD this year is gonna be wicked. |-| 
|-| co996u1 || 4 || YES!!! I've been waiting for this for so long!  |-| 
|-| co9kszb || 4 || I just bought five. Not sure why.  |-| 
|-| co922js || 19 || An official Reddit merch item that doesn't cost several times what it should?

What madness is this? |-| 
|-| co91b33 || 9 || If Reddit is getting old then I'm getting really, really old. Time certainly flies. |-| 
|-| co91rvu || 7 || cant wait to see what customizers in /r/vinyltoys do with this vinyl snoo. i might buy one myself. |-| 
|-| co9515j || 6 || Can't resist. Gotta have a little Snoo. |-| 
|-| co96njb || 3 || Tried buying it twice w/two different cards, error code 402 each time.

Either I'm an idiot, my identity was stolen or something is broken. |-| 
|-| co97kua || 3 || this makes me wish I could paint... or do anything vaguely artistic. |-| 
|-| co9el45 || 3 || The box says "series 1" -- what can we expect for the next series of snoo figurines?  Is this going to turn into some sort of beanie baby thing? |-| 
|-| co94n8l || 4 || I want one!! |-| 
|-| co91rdd || 3 || I'm pretty excited about this. I like supporting the site, but gold feels kind of "empty"...

I think a lot of people would be much more inclined to financially support Reddit if they got some physical thing in return, or if they knew that part of the money they gave could go to a charity of their choice or something. 

At least that way I could convince myself that the time I waste on Reddit is helping someone in need.  |-| 
|-| co9258y || 3 || Are there a limited amount of these? I notice it says "series 1" on the box, are there plans for more?  |-| 
|-| co91cm4 || 5 || So basically a [Munny](http://sites.kidrobot.com/munnyworld/) in the form of a Snoo. Pretty neat, we used to spend lots of our off time decorating these things at work. |-| 
|-| co913tr || 4 || It's weird that the circle on the antenna is open. |-| 
|-| co91lg1 || 4 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| co91p69 || 4 || It's like your own personal snoovatar. |-| 
|-| co93ahc || 3 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| co96uvp || 3 || Are you guys working on the frequent 503 errors I'm getting when loading reddit? |-| 
|-| co98yfh || 3 || Omg, these are adorable! I want to hug him and squish him and call him George! 

Must. Get. Several. O_o |-| 
|-| co916k3 || 3 || Death by snoo snoo...? |-| 
|-| co98cje || 3 || For those of you who think this is a good price, looks like you can get stuff like this for 50 cents a piece in bulk, so you are paying a 1800% markup: http://zxltoy.en.alibaba.com/product/1922172126-800350457/Best_selling_eco_friendly_2014_wholesale_3D_vinyl_pvc_toy_action_figure_princess.html |-| 
|-| co93ahk || -3 || Ah, yes, exactly what we needed. Not a decent text size or the vote counts back. Of course. Duh. |-| 
|-| co971ry || -5 || So reddit can't afford to load pages for me with regular consistency but they can afford to design and market a vinyl figurine?

 |-| 
|-| co924cv || -7 || **McReddit is nothing but a advertisers Mecca.** |-| 
|-| co929qw || -7 || This is cool and all, but [what happened to reddit notes?](http://fortune.com/2015/01/30/reddit-notes-is-not-going-to-happen/)  Cryptocurrency &gt; dolls.. |-| 
|-| co9ab6z || -3 || Whenever i see one of those things I immediately think fedora-wearing racist manchild who hates women. |-| 
|-| co94ob2 || -3 || Shit. Vinyl. That's bad stuff. Don't let kids chew on it for starters. There are definitely better materials you could have used.  |-| 
|-| co946kz || -8 || STOP TRYING TO SELL US SHIT WE DON'T NEED,, REDDIT!
