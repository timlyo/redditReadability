|-| cnu0gx4 || 10 || The title is a bit misleading, but it was a worthwhile watch.  This doc is predominantly about the struggles of the Mayan underclass in and around Cancun, juxtaposed against the wealthy, young tourists who frequent Cancun's resorts.  

It should not, however, be any surprise at all that tourists dollars to not bleed into the Cancun community as much as they used to due to the all-inclusive nature of Cancun resorts.  There are very legitimate tourist fears of crime and violence in Mexico, even in Cancun, which is undoubtedly a big reason why the hotels have moved in that direction. You see similar models at play in Jamaica and elsewhere.

As Cancun has also skewed itself more towards the younger demographic, I would imagine the average tourist level of interest towards cultural tourism has also waned substantially compared to what it once was.   |-|

|-| cnu8tx9 || -5 || Just watched this -- very engaging. I greatly admire Aaron and surely wish things did not end the way that they did. But -- perhaps I have some big blind spot -- but he did steal things from JSTOR. And the Feds decided to send a message to the geeks, using this brilliant young man as an example: don't try to nullify laws that you think are unjust. They prosecuted because they they could (i.e., solid legal theory) and they wanted to send a message. 

I myself detest academic publishing, including JSTOR. But just downloading tons of  what-is-technically JSTOR's property to give away? That was not the right way to go about things.

Anyway, the documentary is inspiring and well-done. |-|

My own feeling is one of real interest: I usually feel terrible for these guys on death row. This guy however isn't just some absolute lunatic or shut in who has lived a pathetic life and are heading towards a grim death.

He's well travelled, has loads of stories, and seems to have genuinely enjoyed the life he had. It makes it less tragic that he is being put to death since he really did take the opportunity to 'live'.

I hope that makes sense, and doesn't sound like I am belittling his horrific crimes too much. |-| 
|-| cnuffun || -10 || There is no "the government". There is a chaos of individuals, all with their own attitudes and agendas. While some of them were seeking to discredit the movement and its leaders, others were protecting students trying to integrate schools, passing anti-segregation laws, and handing down legal decisions in favor of the movement. 

Aim carefully.  |-| 
|-| cnufv4f || 3 || See this, but if possible, see Fitzcarraldo first. This is an amazing, disturbing doc that made me hate Werner for a while.  There is a bizarre self-referential aspect to the documentary, as if it's a more accurate version of the story told in the movie. 

Since seeing this doc, I've forgiven Herzog. He makes some great documentaries and entertaining movies.

As a student project it's great,  and kudos for the effort and intention,  but it falls short when presented as it is here or on Netflix.  |-| 
|-| cnvhujn || 11 || It's easy to point fingers and say call it poverty tourism or a waste of time-- but are YOU doing anything right now?? At least they're trying to become more aware of the situations abroad, and at least they're trying to help others become more aware.

|-| cnvl92s || 3 || I read somewhere on reddit of some research of the USA that concluded violent revolutions occur about every 60 years. I tried to find it. I wouldn't be at all surprised if the super-rich become targets of violence within a few years. Again, self interest thought through to the end doesn't support unlimited greed for an isolated individual. 

I think the most important point mentioned is that the super-rich cannot sustain a whole economy as they cannot spend enough to do so, e.g. if a billionaire makes 10000x more than the average, they cannot easily spend 10000x more. What if I had $1 billion, that's 10,000x more than $100,000, and that's already more than twice the average income. Were I to spend all of my money and save 10%, I'd have to spend $900,000,000...every year! They'd need to hire someone just to figure out how to spend this much.

They made an interesting point that countries strive to lure the super-rich to come to their country to pay taxes.  |-|

I came back here expecting to see positive comments and was disappointed to see that everyone has chosen instead to shit on this well-done student documentary. I felt that I gained a better perspective in the mere hour or so of watching the documentary about poverty than I have from talking about it for a few weeks in my AP Spanish class. I had never heard of things like microloans, and this documentary gave me hope that through small donations and loans people may be able to get ahead on costs for starting businesses so that they can maintain their families. Shame on those who do nothing but point to the poverty in the states. Poverty is difficult anywhere, and has its differences when comparing countries, and we cannot wall ourselves in and ignore the fact that people who aren't like us culturally are suffering. There is nothing wrong with taking up the cause of the voiceless, regardless of where those people come from. |-|

However the lack of hard evidence and rampant hearsay makes me uncomfortably skeptical. Yes, dead children are terrible, but, you know what? That's war, man. That's why it sucks. It's impossible to wage war without innocent people getting killed.

He started from the assumption that the US military is evil, and cherry-picked some stories that supported that, while adding spooky music and desaturated color grading for extra effect. While, yes, that is technically how you make any documentary, it's just the way he did it was bullshit scare mongering.

|-| cobyblu || 6 || I remember the craze. I had a co-worker from a different state who'd visit every month or so, and I'd always end up driving him to the beanie baby store. It was around the same time as Pogs, it's amazing and sad how some useless trinkets simply take off. |-|

|-| cobsfjz || 5 || I am not going to watch this because the title sounds insanely depressing.  Also the title is from my experience incorrectly written. It should be the "pervasive problem of rape and prostitution of males who are in the bottom of the social/economic ladder."

But as a person who was "almost" raped several times in South Asia, I would like to give my thoughts on this.

This is not a "hidden" thing. A more accurate way to describe it is: it is basically unknown by people who are not at the bottom of the society.  For example I have been very open about the several times I was almost raped and the people who are in the South Asian Middle Class (or above) do have constant contact with the abject poor BUT they do not know (IMHO) how they live and what they go thru on a daily basis. 

If anyone is interested I can go into details.  But basically if a male looks like he is at the bottom of society he is a target for rape.  But if that male person tells his rapist that he has an uncle who is in the police (or army or whatever) than he will be left alone and not fucked (literally) with.

The way to compare this with Western nations might be to compare these poor males (from South Asia) with run-aways (from North America).  Obviously no one in the mainstream media (in either region) wants to talk about this topic.  |-|

|-| cobi57m || 6 || The most anticipated Kurt Cobain documentary in years, [Soaked In Bleach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZemFEssQdo), is supposed to be released this year, and deals with some of the same subject matter covered in this film by Nick Broomfield. |-|
