Lee's Birthday (Jackson was added later) is January 19th. That was the day it was always celebrated. VA later changed it to the Friday before MLK to avoid the obviously strange coincidence that put these two dates on top of each other.

edit: And for all you saying he should have hung; In 1860 the US was essentially a conglomeration of separate nation-states with their own identity. The sense of nationalism we see today and throughout the 20th century is a result of the Civil War and by a much greater extent, the first and second world wars. No one chanted USA! USA!. He was a Son of Virginia, and as such his loyalties lied with Virginia. He hated that the south seceded, but he did his duty. And when the war was over, he did his duty to see that it didnt continue. 

May I also remind you that our nations most hallowed ground, Arlington National Cemetery, was his home. |-|

|-| cnu2v9w || 19 || Common Core makes math more object oriented, this is in fact how I came to understand math way before common core was a thing. 

Basically the idea is adding by 5's and 10's is easier than multiples of 3 etc.  Which is almost always true. It becomes more relevant with larger numbers and mental math,  but this is the basics. 

You want to add 8 and 5, so to make 8 a multiple of 10, you add 2(which is taken from the 5), then you would add the remainder.  Again too basic for benefits. 

8+5 = 10+3 

While I'm not an advocate for or against common core,  forcing children to think and understand the material is vital,  not just regurgitate information. While it's obvious common core isn't perfect, no system would be,  bringing more attention to our education system is the real win of common core regardless of how you feel about it specifically or what ultimately happens.  |-|

|-| cnu2z9m || 315 || ITT: Old dogs who can't learn new tricks.

Seriously.  It's not the way we learned as kids, but this theory can be longer-lasting and far more helpful in the long run than rote memorization.

It's how many of us do this sort of problem in our head, anyway.  With larger numbers, I'll almost always add to the nearest 10/100/1000/etc...

|-| cnu30t8 || 176 || Oh good, a Common Core hate thread based entirely on facebook shares. 

First things first: Common Core doesn't mandate teaching math this way, despite what your conservative friends keep saying on facebook and chain emails. There are guidelines recommending teaching adding and subtracting by parts, but they are not mandates, and they also recommend teaching multiple techniques. Specifically, [they do say that you have to teach the old way as well](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/4/NBT/).

Second, *this is actually how you do math in your head now*, though this particular question is worded somewhat poorly. [From here:](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2014/03/07/about-that-common-core-math-problem-making-the-rounds-on-facebook/)

&gt;consider this: Suppose you buy coffee and it costs $4.30 but all you have is a $20 bill. How much change should the barista give you back? (Assume for a second the register is broken.)
You sure as hell aren’t going [to get out a sheet of paper and do this](http://i.imgur.com/OKh4BeF.jpg)

&gt;Instead, you’d just figure it out this way: It’d take 70 cents to get to $5… and another $15 to get to $20… so you should get back $15.70.

&gt;That’s it. That’s the sort of math most of us do on a regular basis and it’s exactly the sort of thinking the “new” way in the picture is attempting to explain. Granted that was an *awful* example to use, but that’s the idea. If students can get a handle on thinking this way instead of just plugging numbers into a formula, the thinking goes, it’ll make other math skills much easier to understand.

Or, from a reddit post that looked at another overstated and poorly-explained situation: http://i.imgur.com/uePcpfB.png

If you didn't have 8+5 memorized, you would generally add 2 to get to a base-10 number, then add the other 3 to make 13. For larger numbers, this is how we process adding and subtracting in our head anyway. 

tl;dr: the anti-Common Core pictures ignore, distort, and/or misstate Common Core standards because it's what Fox News and AM radio said was true.  |-|

|-| cnu50r2 || 3 || I've done math pretty much like that my entire life, and have taught my children how to do it that way as well, but in my case, there's no "right" answer to how you round off, it's just that you find the nearest fast intermediate step, by borrowing from one side or the other, to get to a round number, and then doing the remainder of the math from there.   Take any given number, no matter mow many digits and multiply it by 48. the easiest way to get there is that you multiply by 50 and take away that number times 2. if you're not comfortable with multiplying by 50, then add 2 zeros and divide by half. The point is to break the problem down to anything you can do real fast in your head without resorting to paper. It adds some steps, but it shortens the overall process for a lot of people. In this case here, (which is worded horribly) 10+3 is easier than 8+5  and getting to 10 from 8 means moving over 2 from one side to the other, so 8+5's faster equivalent is 10+3 (8+2) + (5-2) |-|

 |-| 
|-| cnu5ck6 || 84 || I'm not against trying to teach mental math. The problem though is standardizing it - there are multiple correct ways to do mental math.  It is solely to aid the individual.  Kids who can simply add 8+5, memorize it, or find another way to solve the problem will be penalized.

At this level, counting fingers should be totally acceptable.  It's a visual and mental cue.  Kids will group their numbers (fingers) however their brain naturally groups them, and they are limited to 10 anyways.  Anything beyond 10 is done mentally, which is great.

I never lost it, I guess.  I read constantly, I'm fascinated by everything.  I learn one thing, and I absolutely must know more and more about it till I find that glorious wall of "we don't know."  I find that the most awesome point in any field.

According to my brother, though, it's all been done.  There is, for some reason, no more to learn.  And he's passing that along to my nephew.

I described it in another thread as if he's taking away my nephew's Hobbes.  Pretty soon, he'll just be a dumb stuffed tiger for that kid, and I have no idea what to do, or if I should even try to reverse it.  Or if I'm already too late.

The only problem is a kid has to recognize that there's 3 remaining after adding. 2+8 =10, 10+3 = 13. Result is the same as 8+5=13.

I don't use it and I thought it was stupid when I first saw it, then I realized it had applications outside decimal, namely octal and hexadecimal. |-| 
|-| cnu7skc || 5 || &gt;Yes you can. Take 2 from 5...

5-2 = 3

&gt;and add it to 8...

8+2 = 10

&gt;then add 3

10+3 = 13

*Take 2 from 5 and add it to 8, consider the sort of unrelated fact that 8+2=10, and then add 3*

Really? How is that faster? It doesn't even lead to the correct answer for 8+5.

Sorry math teachers... you can try to whitewash this one all you want, but it is seriously F---ed up. Instead of trying to explain what the teacher meant, you should be crying about incompetence in your profession and the frustrating beat-down of another young intellect.

|-| cnu9bb0 || 7 || I think we're debating the wrong thing.  I, too, was taught these kinds of techniques to help do mental arithmetic. When I learned it, it was called "compatible numbers", but usually we would move around the operands to find tens wherever we could to help see the solution faster.

What I can't stand about this question is the ambiguity.  Mathematics should be teaching students how to think **more** precisely, not less so by interpreting some hand-waved bullshit.  
"Make 10" already has a definition in mathematics: "To add up to 10".  If they want to refer to some trick they've been teaching, they should pick a different phrase. Call it the break-apart technique or whatever, so we can refer to it **precisely**.
I don't disagree with the student's answer in this case, using the real definition of "make 10", you can't do it with 8+5 alone, you'd have to subtract 3. So I guess that would be my answer, "by subtracting 3".

TL;DR - These mental math tricks aren't inherently evil, but should not be conflated with the correct or incorrect way to approach a problem. |-| 
|-| cnu9bj8 || 5 || I don't think it's very easy to teach this kind of intuition of creating a 10 from components of one number and then adding a remainder.  This is something that someone teaches themselves after massive replication of the problem type.  I wish they would stop teaching this way and get back to fundamentals. |-| 
|-| cnu9bjh || 7 || ITT: Young children being introduced to maths should instantly know how to add 8+5 naturally and don't need to be taught additional methods to apply to much larger numbers.

|-| cnu9eao || 3 || There is another redditor that explains the context of this worksheet.  The worksheet is intended to teach a trick, called "making tens", which is intended to make mental math easier.  

I think that there are several pedagogical points being missed during the teaching of both methods, and I will argue here that teaching the standard paper-and-pencil method should be preferred over spending any time teaching mental mathematics.

First, let us go over some points being missed when teaching both methods.  Many teachers, during the course of teaching both mental math and paper/pencil techniques, end up simply outlining how to manipulate the symbols to obtain the correct symbolic expressions.  It is left unrealized to the student why the methods in use work.  The methods in use work because of two things: 1) the manner in which Hindu-Arabic numeral notation works and 2) the distributive law of addition with multiplication.  An appreciation for both will allow students, in principle, to work out arbitrary multiplications and additions after only memorizing multiplications and additions for the numerals 0-9.

For instance, without using any tricks, one can multiply 63 by 49, by noting:

63 * 49 = (60+3) * (40+9) [Merely noting what Hindu-Arabic notation entails)

=(60+3) * (40)+(60+3) * 9 [Distributive laws]

=(60 * 40)+(3 * 40)+(60 * 9)+(3 * 9) [Distributing again]

= (2400) + (120) +(540) + (27) 

= (2000+400) + (100 + 20) + (500 + 40) + (20 + 7)

= (2000) + (500 + 400 + 100) + (40 + 20 + 20) + 7

= 3000 + 80 + 7  = 3087

Now, such a method should be replaced by something more economical, and some steps above can be easily compressed once skill is gained, but it has the advantage of *conveying understanding* of Hindu-Arabic numerals and some laws of arithmetic more than some pencil/paper methods and mental methods do. Although we should teach these more economical ways of doing things, *we should first make sure that we understand why the more economical shortcuts always work*.

Second, I will contend that learning paper and pencil methods for working out arithmetic should take precedence over learning mental math tricks.  First, paper and pencil methods allow one to work out problems with high numbers of digits with only the requirement of patience.  Mental math tricks generally reach their limits at 4 or 5 digits for addition and at 2 or 3 digits for multiplication.  Next, the need for immediate mental mathematics in both daily life and in work is probably overestimated by curricula which incorporate high levels of time towards mental math.  

Third, I will argue that mental math patterns as applied to those problems which are accessible to being resolved mentally will become obvious to those who gain enough experience using paper and pencil methods *and* who have enough knowledge to know why these methods work.  This is because both methods (paper/pencil and any mental methods) are invariably exploitative of the laws of arithmetic.  This is an argument from personal experience, but I never had to be taught any arithmetic "mental tricks" in order to find myself employing them.  Instead, my trained intuition for the laws of arithmetic (commutativity, associativity, and distributivity) naturally manifested in the employment of mental math tricks; even at a young age.

In conclusion, the teaching of mental mathematics really *is* a waste of time and resources, and teachers should instead emphasize knowledge of the laws of arithmetic.  Also, the need for economizing the problem solving process should be met *mostly* by the teaching of paper/pencil methods for doing so.

You can read the actual Common Core Educational standards [here](http://www.corestandards.org/read-the-standards/). 

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation reportedly donated over two hundred million dollars to the development and political support of the Common Core Standards [source](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-bill-gates-pulled-off-the-swift-common-core-revolution/2014/06/07/a830e32e-ec34-11e3-9f5c-9075d5508f0a_story.html). Under the common core, nationally syndicated standardized testing will be conducted on computers instead of on paper. Not only will this create a huge volume of initial sales for Gates’ company, Microsoft, when thousands of rural school districts have to make massive upgrades to their data systems and student-accessible technology, but it will also provide a priceless contract to Microsoft: the sole proprietorship to create, publish and distribute the only federally approved, nationally implemented standardized testing software in the United States. Bill Gates obviously has a gigantic private financial interest in the Common Core, and he was able to influence its' creation and success through providing funding and generating political support.

Dr. Sandra Stotsky, one of just two people on the Common Core committee with educational expertise at or above a university level and indeed the only member with graduate work in English Language Arts, made the following statements about the Common Core standards in a video interview: “… by grade eight, American students would be about two years behind their peers in high achieving countries…” and “… Common Core’s standards were not going to be preparing students for authentic college level work…” and “…it will not improve [students’] critical thinking skills. It will reduce the ability to develop critical thinking skills…” [Video Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K4URgulWhk). Both Dr. Stotsky and Dr. James Milgram, the only mathematician with a PhD in  content on the committee for creating the Common Core standards, now travel the country giving public speeches about the complete and utter inadequacy of the Common Core. |-|

He's in for a long arduous decade or so of schooling if he doesn't pay attention to the content of the lectures, and tries to get through tests based off of logic and reasoning.

Understanding this method imparts a much better understanding of the properties of addition than the standardly, rote-memorized "carry digit" algorithm.

All these "BLARGHH COMMON CORE" memes etc make no sense because you literally have zero idea how the teacher taught it. Taught correctly it is actually quite intuitive. you have 8 things. You add five more. Put 8 fingers up. Count 2 to get 10. You have start again and put up 3 new fingers and get 13. Kids a lot of the times do this naturally.

The whole reason it was introduced is because someone objected to the old system of teaching match as being a "one size fits all" solution, so they introduced another "one size fits all" method, making the same dumb mistake. 

People need to realize that some kids learn better one way, while other kids learn better another way.  The point shouldn't be to teach all kids on specific way of doing math.  The point *SHOULD* be to teach all kids math, using whatever method works best for those kids.  If a kid can get the right answer, good for them.  It really shouldn't matter what method the kid uses, if they can get the problem right without just "guessing".   |-|

|-| cnub9hi || -3 || Robert E. Lee definitely deserves a day in his honor, yet nobody in this thread seems to understand why. The idea of a strong federal government imposing taxes, etc. on the Southern States was scary. Not even a century prior the British had done the same thing. States rights were huge and as America was expanding the clashing of the different ideals caused all of the tension. When the war broke out and Virginia seceded Robert E. Lee followed because of his loyalty to his home, family, and State. He was a Virginian first and an American second, as America was supposed to be a loose union of the states. Contrary to popular belief the Civil War wasn’t about slavery. Lincoln would have ended the war and let them keep their slaves if that would have lead to a quicker end to the war. The war was over States rights and all I see in response to that statement is “hurr durr they just wanted their slaves.” At any point in time prior to the war only about 10% of the Southern Population owned slaves. Slavery or no slavery was something Southerners believed should have been a decision made by each state, not the big, scary federal government. It can ******loosely****** be compared to the Je Suis Charlie events going on. Many people don’t support the kind of satire, etc. Like many southerners didn’t own or support slavery. However they supported their right to own slaves if the state decided they could. Like many believe the writers at Charlie Hebdo have the right to make their cartoons poking fun at Muslims if the government allows freedom of speech. Robert E. Lee was a man of honor, character, and was extremely patriotic, except back then one’s love for one’s state came before the country. He did many great things before and after the war notable of recognition. This is probably too late to get any attention, but something should be said. |-| 
|-| cnub9mw || 3 || FUCK COMMON CORE.

Edit: The problem with common core isn't the concepts. It's how it presents itself as the only way of doing things and punishes anyone who doesn't conform to doing it THEIR WAY, even if that doesn't work for the particular child. Intelligence is NOT one-size-fits-all. |-|

|-| cnubb9b || 50 || **Whoa Reddit, back this comment train up a little. This isn't about racism or disrespect**

I really think people are taking this post in the wrong perspective, completely. Allow me to explain the history behind this.

I'm from Alabama, and I'm actually a huge supporter of MLK Jr, but there is actually a reasonable explanation why we celebrate both Robert E. Lee and Martin Luther King, Jr. day, and it has nothing to do with racism whatsoever.

We have celebrated Robert E. Lee day since the 1800's, nearly half a century before Martin Luther King, Jr was even born. We didn't recently start it as some way to discredit MLK or distract from it.

Now that there is a MLK day, the two holidays fell too close together on the fiscal calendar, and Alabama combined the two holidays simply for economic reasons. We celebrate both, and both men are very well-respected in our state.

Many of you, particularly the younger crowd, probably has no idea who Robert E. Lee is. I think it's important to point out that he was one of the greatest military leaders to have ever existed in the Western Hemisphere, and his military techniques are still studied by strategists in Europe, and all over the world. His battlefield tactics and maneuvers are absolutely GENIUS.

More so, he was looked up to by Southerners like a father and defender during a period of terribly tragedy, and he was widely cherished for treating his soldiers with respect and affection. He was also always fair to the enemy combatants he captured, and would have never agreed with the type of immoral behavior (torture, rape, murder) that exists in our Army today. Robert E. Lee was indeed a great American who deserves respect and attention.

Having said that, I will of course be battered with the typical reply: *"But he was a slave-owner, and he he fought for the southern cause of slavery!!!"...*

1)Yes, Robert E. Lee did own slaves. This was because he grew up in a culture where most of America, including Northerners, accepted slavery as an acceptable way of life. For that matter, Ulysses Grant, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Andrew Jackson, Thomas Jefferson, all unarguably great Americans, also owned slaves, yet I don't see anyone on Reddit protesting their fame or holidays.

2) Robert E. Lee didn't join the war for the "southern cause". He joined it for the "Virginia cause", as Lee was very proud of his state, and he promised to stand with Virginia whether she joined the Northern side, or the Southern side. He felt his duty was to defend his home state, and that's exactly what he did. Lee later became the General of the Army of Northern Virginia, and he finely-tuned it into one of the best armies that has ever walked the face of this earth. It's very important to understand how much statehood and state's right's meant to Robert E. Lee, and this issue encompassed much, much, more than the issue of slavery.


As an Alabamian, I personally celebrate both men, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert E. Lee, and so I feel we have a much more interesting holiday than other states. 

They were both outstanding Americans, though both men had flaws, but their influence on this country is almost unprecedented to any other figure(s) in our nations history. 


(**EDIT**: The fuck, Reddit? Down-voting my comment simply because I try to rationalize this topic with a bit of historical in-sight, and suddenly my inbox blows up with hate mail?

The point is to understand the process rather than memorize. As the child gets into larger numbers, eventually it will be impossible to memorize all sums. 

As an example "make 100" is also a term:

Think how you'd add 99 + 37. First you'd **make 100** by taking 1 from the 37 and adding it to the 99 to make a nice round number. Then you add the 36 to that nice round number, and easily get 136 in your head.

You memorized one process, rather than every single answer to every possible 2/3 digit addition question.

This teacher is teaching that child the process. |-|

|-| cnuc6hs || 6 || Unpopular opinion here: First of all, we don't know exactly what they were being taught at that specific time so we can't just assume, "hurrr durrrr common core lollll no sense it makes to anyone XDDDDD" It was MOST LIKELY that the kid wasn't paying attention in class. Second, I think that this is actually a good way of teaching because it teaches kids to think outside of the box. I've never really agreed with the way math was taught in schools because it teaches that even though there are tons of different ways to do something, there is only one RIGHT way and it is the way the specific teacher likes the most. Schools do not encourage thinking of other ways things could be solved. 

One example regarding this question is, say you have 2 stacks of 5 apples. Well obviously you have 10 apples. But what if you want 8 apples? You take a whole stack and only 3 from the other stack. There will be some people that say, "Well that is 5+5-2." And to that I say, how many times have you ever needed 8 apples so you grabbed 10 and then said, "Okay. Now I need to put 2 back." Instead of just grabbing 8?

I've seen a ton of people that don't understand this way of teaching and always trash it because it is not what they grew up with, but that's a problem. They assume that because they weren't taught how to do it that it doesn't make sense to anyone but that is just going to end up being an excuse your kids are going to use when they don't understand how to do something because they fell asleep in class. I guess my point with all of this babbling is, just because you aren't used to it, does not mean it is wrong.

Edit: Just wanted to clarify something. I don't know if this is real or if it is really how they teach. If it is though, I think that it is a fine way to teach as long as kids focus and are not influenced by their parents' trash talking. 

Another example of people trashing common core just because they aren't used to it is, I saw a bunch of people trashing "common core" because the way they teach to add big numbers is to separate them in to groups and add that way. Examples: 5234 + 2180 would be 5000+2000 and 200+100 and 30+80 and 4+0 which would be 7000, 300, 110, 4. So then you start adding right to left. 4+110 = 114 + 300 = 414 +7000 = 7414. Which is correct and an easy way for little kids to understand the idea of adding bigger numbers. However, it is not the "right" way though because it's not what a lot of people grew up with. |-|

Slavery was 90% of the reason the South was willing to go to war, and people who celebrate the 'rebel south' are either using it as a mask for racism, or are just fucking stupid.  I don't care if Lee helped with the reconstruction, he is just as, if not more responsible for the destruction, as he is the rebuilding.  

Would we celebrate Hitler if he changed his mind toward the end and started campaigning for Zionism?  Some sins are unforgivable, and being a figurehead for the division of the country and the continuation of slavery, and willing to go to war for those ideals, makes you forever a traitor. |-|

Come to think of it, that is actually fairly clearly what the question is meant to teach. 

So if that was explained, the question is good.

|-| cnudbgi || 6 || Wouldn't it make a lot more sense to ask "How would you make 10 from 8 and 5?"

Or even "What numbers and processes would you add to the equation '8+5= x' to make x=10?"

Inserting a plus sign in there, asking for the product of 8 + 5 to come out as 10 seems like a bastardization of the universally-accepted mathematical syntax that has been the cornerstone of scientific collaboration since the notion existed.

8+5 can never equal 10, because 8 means eight of something, 5 means five of something, and + means those two actual stated values are added together.

I get that a lot of educators and engineers agree that Common Core, as it's intended to be conveyed, has a lot of value in equipping children with the cognitive tools to think flexibly about a problem. Hell, Common Core may be what eventually saves humanity by defeating Skynet (after Elon Musk punches 14+6=10 into a terminal and causes the whole infrastructure to explode in a classic DOES NOT COMPUTE scenario), but sooo many of the examples I'm seeing are diluted, unclear, basically half-assed executions of the curriculum like the one in the OP. Learning how to get 10 out of 8 and 5 is great, learning that 8+5 may or may not equal 10 probably isn't, and I think the distinction here is critical.

If our educators aren't equipped linguistically to properly disseminate the techniques, is it really any better than teaching kids straight calculation? At least then, they could use a calculator to check the work... |-|

|-| cnuhalq || 4 || I know this will get buried and has probably already been answered, but here goes:

Robert E. Lee was actually rather progressive in his views for the time.  While he pretty much kept out of politics before the war, his personal beliefs were actually against slavery and fully in support of moving forward.  

The only real reason why he fought for the south was that Virginia had thrown in with with Confederacy.  Today that seems like a crazy reason but back at the time of the civil war, people thought differently about borders and boundries.  Your local town or village was where most of your politics originated.  Sometimes neighboring towns would even fight over resources.  Next up was the county.  Yes, people actually cared about what county they were in and what happened within it as it had a fairly large effect on them.  Next down the list was the state.  Again, things at the state level had a generally decent impact so people paid attention and supported their state.  Finally, you had the federal government.  Contrary to the town/county/state support, the federal government was this *thing* that was far off and only generally understood.  Rarely did things happen at the federal level which affected the day to day lives of the average American so people didn't care about it.

So, when Virginia seceded, Robert E. Lee went with them.  Not necessarily because he agreed with their politics but because it was his state.  He placed more value in his state then he did the United States government at the time.  That was actually what most Southerners who fought for the South believed.  You fight for your town/county/state.  The people who supported slavery were actually a small minority in the South.  Unfortunately, that small minority was also made up of all the people who held the power.  

There were also other problems at the time which people saw as irreconcilable.  Mainly economic problems and pork projects.  For instance, Northern states had a majority of votes in the House which allowed them to push through projects in their states like subsidizing a good railroad system but they did not extend those projects into Southern states whose railways were left in a poor and undeveloped state.  So, even if people didn't agree with slavery, they still ended up supporting secession as they felt they were getting screwed by the current system.

I know I went off on a tangent and nobody will ready this but this specific topic has held my fascination for years.  Hope somebody has learned something from it all! |-|

The real math version of this question is:

8 + 5 = 10 + x

Learning mathematics is not backwards compatible. Sure you can achieve 10 and greater by using 8 and 5. Sure you can actually take your shoes off and count 13 out that way as well. More and most importantly if you take 2 away from 5 then you have 3 and that's a teacher who should know how to phrase mathematical question. So let's just give him this break one time.

|-| cnunp3l || 7 || A mathematician here. I see why they would teach this, but in my opinion I don't think it is intuitive to the average person. Mathematicians think so much abstraction that it becomes second nature to visually seperate things in "simpler" things. Because subtracting from or adding to 10 is pretty easy, a mathematician would see 8+5 and break these numbers up into (10-2)+(3+2) and rearrange them into (10+3)+(-2+2)=13+0 and get 13. Kind of like "removing the junk". 

To an average person this looks like a pain in the ass as it involves a lot more steps, and like a mentioned, it doesn't seem intuitive. I do understand why they want to teach it, but I would rather they let students explore addition for themselves through visuals or objects and have teachers guide this "make 10 rule" to the students, as opposed to teaching this cool rule in such a mechanical process. We're not computers. Math is an art. How can people like it if all you do is show them how to paint a picture and never let them paint for themselves.  |-|

Meanwhile I know another guy, now in his late twenties, who married a girl who turned out to be a hardcore Twi-hard. She very sneakily convinced him to name their two sons Jacob and Edward. I don't think he figured out the connection until the kids were 2 &amp; 3 years old, and too old to change their names.

&gt;An architect built this little gem in the early 2000s… his name was Andrei, so, he dedicated it to Holy Apostle Andrew the First-Called (Андрей Первозванный: Andrei Pervozvanny). The lake is 108 square kilometres (42 square miles) in area, with 18 square kilometres (7 square miles) being taken up by Olesny Island (it’s roughly 5 kilometres (3 miles) long by 4 kilometres (2.5 miles) wide). This little bit is one of the smaller islets, which take up 15 square kilometres (6 square miles) of area. So, the lake has 75 square kilometres (29 square miles) of water and 33 square kilometres (13 square miles) of islands within it. |-|

|-| cnvj1c6 || 4 || Dear Christopher Reeves,

My mother is a big admirer of yours, but personally I can't even be bothered to spell your name correctly.  |-| 
|-| cnvj3xu || 19 || Yes Coulson!! You're the man! |-| 
|-| cnvj697 || 3 || Why did your husband submit your drawing to this sub too? |-| 
|-| cnvj6l5 || 28 || Great! Now, try using an entire eraser.   |-| 
|-| cnvj8k0 || 123 || That is a beautiful gesture. It has also thrown me into a sobbing stupor. My mom, my beautiful mother who could do no wrong, was taken at only 66. Two months ago. She was the only person I had left... and I loved her to death, god I love her. and i miss her to the point of dellusions sometimes. Waking up having a dream where she is in it and immediately wanting to run upstairs to say hi. Then it hits you all over again, every day. Does it stop? Grief changes shape but it never disappears. 

I'm 24. Both my parents have died. I have no siblings. The closest family I have is 1,000 miles away and they're doing their own things in life. While I'm here, likely to lose the house, awful dreams, the other night I raced upstairs in my dream to see my mom sitting at the counter like nothing was wrong as I desperately tried to warn her of her death date... and to avoid it at all costs. You know when you throw a punch in slow motion when you're dreaming? That's what this was like but instead it was just conveying a date. I felt this date would save her but instead I just woke up in tears. Go hug your fucking parents because god I wish mine could just tell me it will be okay one more time... to just fucking hold me. i'm a wreck.  |-|

|-| cnvj9ys || 344 || It's always so sad when their owners pass away.  Poor pets have no idea, especially when they are seniors themselves.  I really hope someone in that area can adopt her out. She deserves the rest of her cat life to be purring in someone's lap. |-|

It's George Reeves. |-| 
|-| cnvjgob || 5 || This is really neat.  I'm impressed that so many of the celebs took the time not only to sign the card, but to also take the time to actually write a note.  Pretty classy on their part.  Had to laugh at how eclectic the list was - certainly wouldn't try to guess her politics - Bob Dole and Charlton Heston and the Clintons and Robert Redford.

Thanks for sharing this neat gift that you gave to her.

I am imagining an 18th century nomad, wandering the Siberian tundra- an ascetic with no particular destination or path. He is traipsing through a particularly deserted and desolate region when a lake appears. On the lake he spies a tiny island. He knows from experience that the nearest domicile is more than 50km away, and that no one has any reason to ever be in this area. 

"A church," he thinks to himself, "that's what this needs." |-|

|-| cnvluj2 || 71 || My grandfather, after he retired, took up the hobby of writing celebrities / politicians / world leaders - not necessarily asking for anything, but he'd usually read their book or something and send them his thoughts on it.  Occasionally, if he liked the book he'd mail the jacket in a SASE and get them to sign it.  Others leaders, he'd just write them letters to thank them for their service, or how they'd impacted him or something.   

His houses are covered in walls from a who's who of famous people.   His favorite - my grandfather, an Irish Catholic, had long admired Mother Teresa.  When she was old, he wrote her a long letter where he apparently discussed all kinds of things going on in the world.   Several weeks later, she died and my grandfather was very sad - for her death, but also because he figured she never got a chance to read his letter.  A week or so later, he got a letter from her.  It was dated just a few days before her death and it was a several page letter typed out on a typewriter.  There's several corrections she'd crossed out in pen, and then little notes and additions she'd added on in the margins.  My grandfather cried when he got that letter - the only time I'm aware of he cried.  Until the day he died, that was by far his most prized possession. |-|

A few of them were given up because the owner was moving out of state, or just didn't want the cat anymore, and those cases piss me off because it's very hard to adopt out a young adult cat... senior cats can be impossible to place so sometimes they don't get a new forever home :( |-|

|-| cnvsw8c || 5 || All the jokes in this thread aside, these people are fucking idiots - and the sad part is, these idiots exist all over the world, including here in the US. Commercial, military, and even general aviation pilots deal with idiots who have gotten their hands on powerful laser pointers daily.

You know what happens when said powerful lasers hits the glass on a cockpit? It refracts and reflects all over the place. Not only can a pilot be temporarily blinded, losing a precious instrument scan (crucial to simply flying the aircraft), it can fuck with someone's night vision (physiologically, it takes up to 30 minutes to regain adaptation to low light conditions) and cause disorientation. All of which is bad for an aircraft, and even worst for what's underneath said aircraft.

These fuckheads love shining their light on aircraft doing final approaches low to the ground - so not only is the aircraft low and slow, a dangerous combination, but often they are putting the lives of not just the pilots and passengers, but those on the ground in danger.

These Egyptian protestors are really lucky the Apaches didn't decide to light them the fuck up, as they had no problems shooting protesters later on...

If this is a recent picture I'd well believe that this is a protest move, but I remember the exact same thing happening back in the Summer of 2013 when the military coup happened...except the Egyptians weren't pointing the lasers in protest. They were pointing them up in celebration because they knew the military was now on their side and that Morsi would be removed from power. The sight of military helicopters over the square was VERY welcome back then.

http://www.battlecreekenquirer.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/01/22/treetops-ski-resort-vandalism-fraternity/22151055/

"A University of Michigan fraternity has apologized after officials at a ski resort say its members caused thousands of dollars in vandalism.

"Treetops Resort manager Barry Owens said the students were escorted from the premises by Michigan State Police last weekend after causing $50,000 in damage. The resort is in Dover Township near Gaylord.

"Owens said Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity members caused significant damage to furniture, carpet, walls and ceilings." |-|

Did you notice how pictures usually need someone to take them? Like, maybe there's another person in the room? Somebody who might be watching the child while Dad takes a break.

You have no idea how often he plays with his child or plays games. Yeah, maybe he barely looks at her. Or maybe he barely ever plays games. Why do you assume the horrible one? You don't know.

Parents are still people. They're allowed to relax and enjoy their own activities. If he actually gets some down time, he might get some energy back and be able to be a better dad for his daughter.

I'm a dad. I love my son. I try to play with him and interact with him a lot. But it takes a lot of energy. My wife and I will often let each other take breaks. She'll watch a show she likes or I'll play a game. It lets us catch our breath and get some energy back. You can't be 100% focused on a small child all day every day. You'll fucking collapse.

When they are young like this.... their brains are exploding, forming all of the neural connections it needs to.  "Needs" to.  The more connections, the better the brain.  Engage your kids, look into their eyes, give them attention, ask them questions, even as a baby, repeat what happened during the day.  Read to your children, have them follow along in the book.  Teach them balance, let them stand on your hand and hold their hands to find their center.  

Notice the child is looking where the Father is.  The TV is teaching, not the Father.  What is the child seeing?  Is there music playing or sounds of video gaming? Or with headphones on is there silence and no verbal interaction?  What images are being imprinted in their brains?  

I'm not preaching, just passing on some good advice that may seem so basic, but really is important for the future health and success of your kid.  Not dissing the OP, the child seems very much well taken care of, happy and loving.   |-|

Unfortunately, the handle locked up, I ran away, and the entire contents (that white foam shit) emptied. We were on the 4th floor of the hotel with an open middle staircase.

8am, hotel manager came in the room and said "Get out or I will call the police." We left the room and saw like 50 people with masks on scrubbing the walls. Also, I got all my friends kicked out of the hotel at the time. This picture reminded me of this and I feel guilty all over again.

We ran up, floor after floor opening rooms trying to find the source of the water til we made it to the 4th.  After banging on the door, we opened it to find a naked man just inside the door, passed out on the floor, and the bathroom tub running full blast and water everywhere.

He was there on his companies dime ($74,000 in damage and lost revenue).  It didn't end well for him.

edit: evidently people dont understand what overflow's on tubs, and the plumbing behind it is designed for.  look it up people.  it's not designed for tubs on full blast for hours, its designed to help you save your ass because you lost a second or two while filling, and or someone is splashing around in a full tub...ffs.  and the insults?  really?   |-|

A reasonable contractor will bring a few laborers out for a couple days for clean up, and an acoustical ceiling drone for a couple days to fix the grid, and re-set the tiles.

University might be a time that a kid finally gets their own independence, but you're supposed to GROW INTO AN ADULT, not regress into a child.  I know alcohol makes people stupid, but what the everliving fuck, this just shows that they have no respect for other people's property.   |-|

Fuck that.  Fuck it all to hell.  Press charges AND seek financial restitution.  Problem is, there will be tremendous pressure from the moneyed alumni of the fraternity involved to NOT press charges.  These fucktards are EXTREMELY adverse to any criminal charges on little Johnny's record because it will absolutely prevent them from getting the 1% jobs that they so desperately live for.

|-| cnxcfx2 || 4 || When I was in college and we as a frat had a place rented out we partied hard, there was always tons of trash, but we never damaged anything and we always spent an hour or two cleaning it ourselves so the housekeeping staff never had to do any of it. Even when we were camping, whether in a campground or a wild wilderness clearing, we never left a shred of trash from us. College is about learning to be a responsible and functional adult. Fraternity is about building friendships that will be there for life, and bonding over shared experiences. There's no excuse for this. |-|

|-| cnxdb15 || 4 || Story Time! Back in 1994 or so I was at Boyne Mountain resort in Michigan with my family. We were staying in this ski lodge that also had a U of M frat staying there for the weekend. There was a large open basement underneath our section of the hotel and they had set up these gigantic 5 or 6 foot high speakers directly underneath our room. Needless to say it was pretty noisy that night but I slept ok. The next morning is when I saw the full extent of the damage they had caused... the pool was full of all sorts of crap- mostly empty beer cans and solo cups, but also all of the pool furniture and a bunch of cardboard boxes and those big umbrellas. I mean it was totally full. Imagine all that junk floating around during a flood and that is what this pool looked like. My dad had to take a poo and graciously went down the hall to the public bathroom near the lobby so he wouldn't stink up our room. When he went to open the door he could only get it open a few inches because something was blocking the way. He slammed up against the door several times to try and force it open and finally got it open enough to look inside to see what the trouble was and there was this guy completely passed out on the floor and his head was the thing blocking the door! A little while later we were walking down the trashed hallway again and this guy came stumbling out of the bathroom holding his head. I felt kinda bad but mostly the whole things was pretty funny. The hotel didn't charge us for the weekend either because things got so crazy. |-| 
|-| cnxdbk2 || 6 || Is he kissing the man's shoe? And which one is which? I guess the man in the hat is the former survivor? |-| 
|-| cnxdc4b || 22 || When the cubs get older, do they have to seperate the Chimpanzee from them? 

Or

|-| cnxdcqz || 15 || The only time I ever interacted with this frat left me with a pretty awful impression of them. I was doing some work over the course of a couple of days in the house. The front lawn was just mini golf turf. One of the mornings, we arrived to find that there were no doors on any of the bathrooms because they had been busted apart during the previous night's fun, apparently kicked off the hinges. On another, the area that I was in was filled with bags of half-eaten raw onions, part of the previous night's pledging. The house was almost devoid of furniture and what was there was basically dumpster-quality. 

On one morning, when trying to find some cleaning supplies to clean up the disgusting, sticky floor we were working on, I stumbled upon this oddly suspicious hidden room.

|-| cnxeblv || 4 || I grew up so close to this resort I can see the chairlifts from my parent's living room window. This place is the embodiment of Northern Michigan, a small, out of way destination that provides guests with an opportunity to take advantage of the natural beauty and recreation the area has to offer. Treetops is the home of one of the nation's best par 3 golf courses, and has employed many people from my hometown. This place is resort people in my hometown can take pride in, and has unfortunately fallen on hard times recently, filing for bankruptcy only a couple months ago. It makes me sick that anyone would treat this place with such disrespect. This isn't a big company these students hurt, they hurt a lot of hard working people who are in the middle of hard times. I also recently started graduate school at the University of Michigan, where these students attend. I found it impressive how the students here held themselves to a higher standard, but I can see I wasn't completely right in that assessment. These students are only going to return to their lives and hide behind their Greek letters, while someone else takes responsibility and even more clean up their mess.  |-|

|-| cnxecvs || 5 || I used to work in property management in a few ski towns in Colorado.  If anyone looking to rent our homes and/or condos demonstrated any sort of an affiliation with a frat or sorority, we would not allow them on our premises.  Not only do they fuck shit up, they fuck up the vacations of everyone else staying on the property, which means we had to offer property changes, full refunds, and vouchers to all who were affected.

|-| cnxeha3 || 3 || My frat rented a Uhaul to get stuff for a party when I was a pledge and completely destroyed it.  Someone got it in their 18 year old head that because we got the insurance, anything we did would be covered.  We had it for a month (we built stuff for the party and had to get materials), and I can remember being in the car when parking meters, mailboxes, and an entire bus stop (bench and all) were run over with this thing.  Needless to say, insurance didn't cover it and the parents of the pledge who put down the credit card ended up owning a Uhaul.  Didn't feel too bad, as the guy who put it on his card did most of the damage.  College was fun. |-|

|-| cnxf0qb || 268 || Amazing picture, really shows how long ago it was. WWII is slipping from living memory into the stuff of legends and myth. 

Children growing up will no longer be able to meet people with numbers tattooed on them. Yes, we have movies that show some of the inhumanity of this time, but it will feel less real. It'll start to feel like the Titanic sinking or the Hindenburg crash. It'll start to feel like a movie that has a set narrative.

It's natural that we forget that these were people. Living, breathing, thinking, wishing, hoping people. We forget that Germans weren't demons made flesh. That the Allies weren't perfect. We forget that WWII and the Holocaust happened because people chose to make it happen and another group of people chose to do nothing about it.

Let's try not to forget it. Let's remember that we, as humans, are capable of such massive killing and destruction. Let's also remember the great things we're capable of too. And most of all, we need to continually say, NEVER AGAIN. 

We've already failed in places. Rwanda, for example. Turns out stopping genocide isn't easy. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try. |-|

|-| cnxfo9k || 6 || I bell-hopped at a ski resort in a town the used to be very popular, not so much anymore. One day a couple middle aged guys checked out a room they had claimed to be the same one they used to rent out in college, I wasn't really listening as it's kind of difficult lugging bags around with one arm. The room they liked used to be sweet, though kinda junky now, it had a busted ass hot tub on the back deck that hadn't been used in years. Turns out, these guys decided to party in the busted hot tub anyway. House keeping found them passed out in a very suggestive homoerotic positions (four of them). When the woke up they all claimed that they had gone back in time. The House keeper said yup, if by time you mean each others stink holes.  |-|

|-| cnxfpo9 || 364 || EDIT:  Many of you have asked for additional photographs.  [Here's](http://imgur.com/a/cYG70) an album of Great Basin's images.



Great Basin National Park has been thrilled with all the interest in the discovery of the Winchester Model 1873 rifle in the park. Everyone has a lot of good questions. Here are some answers to some of the most common questions asked.

What caliber is the gun? .44-40

Was it loaded? No

Were there any shells nearby? No

Will we use metal detectors to look for shells or other clues to the gun's history? Yes, probably.

Were human remains found with the gun? No nothing was visible near the gun. Surveys will continue in the area in the spring when the snow melts.

Why didn't the tree grow around the gun, this has happened to other guns and objects? The tree is a juniper tree and they are very slow growing. The gun was not left in the crotch of a tree where it might have been grown around. Also the bark on the tree is dead and the rifle was not in contact with anything other than the bark, if it were leaning against a spot on the tree where a living branch broke or had been cut the tree might have grown around the rifle. 

The orange tape around the stock of the gun, what does it do? The orange tape is flagging that has been wrapped and woven around the stock to keep it from further damage and degradation. There is no adhesive on the flagging, adhesive could cause damage to the stock.

How many inches was the stock buried? Between 4 and 5 inches.

How often do we have discoveries like this in the park? This is an unusual artifact. We identify many artifacts in the Park, some are much older than this rifle. This is the first time a rifle or anything of this type has been documented by park employees.


Have we had a significant discovery like this in the park before? This is one of many significant artifacts found in the park. Not all are as glamorous or exciting. Artifacts tell a story that helps us understand how people used the area now protected in the park. It is unusual to find something of this type in this circumstance and condition.

If it wasn't loaded could it be a burial marker? We do not have any evidence of a burial or death associated with this artifact. We are continuing research.

Indeed, these things have a tendency to backfire as the person realizes that they should be made happy by something like this and feel guilty as a result.  

If the depression stems from feelings of insecurity, things like this help in the short term but do precious little for people in the long run.  People who feel bad about themselves tend to continue feeling bad about themselves no matter evidence to the contrary.  

All of this is to say that things like this are very sweet and worthy of a Nicholas Sparks novel, but are ultimately ineffectual.  If you want to really help a chronically depressed girlfriend, convince her to go to therapy, go to therapy with her, and/or support her as she works to find an antidepressant that works for her.  |-|

Up until then, a lot of our troops didn't totally understand why we'd fought that war, sure the Nazis were invading places but  europe's problems were europe's problems... then, with the germans having abandoned their posts as the war was being lost, our GIs came across all the camps. 

There's a stunning bit where a soldier from Mobile Alabama, a place not so well known for it's tolerance or understanding, especially in the 40s, is talking about what he'd seen:

It had been lost, found, lost again and then recovered in the state of Arkansas (I'm from ca) through eBay after I had lost it drunkenly on vacation in 2003. 

I swear the thing was magic. The select button stopped working in the late 1990s, except of course, when doing the screen warp in Link's Awakening. Cherish that thing.  |-|

It was like, I don't even know, maybe 40 blue cards. The cover of it says it's ok to have bad days, but if you are and I'm not around to cheer you up, I made you this.

On the cards are pictures of us with little captions. One from when we were first dating and a little note about how she'll always be a silly college freshman at heart. Or a picture of me looking at her walking down the aisle, with a note saying there'll be days like this again even if today is a bummer. Picture of our cat as a kitten and about how he's got my back to. Some of them are more humorous than particularly heavy.

Anyway I cried like a baby when she gave it to me. Partly because I've never done anything nearly as thoughtful for her, partly because she felt the need to do it at all, partly because that's just a ridiculously nice gesture.

I only look at it sometimes, because it sort of chokes me up - sometimes in a good way, sometimes in a more self loathing way. 

But I'll certainly keep it forever.  |-|

The exhibits of personal property confiscated before sending the people to concentration camps was too much to bear.  Combs, dishes, family photos and the like.  

Of course, it was easy to blame the Jews for all the problems in Germany!  It's always handy to have someone to pick on when things go bad.  I could have understood if they had removed Jews from positions of importance or taken over the banks or companies owned by Jews.  But the wholesale, carefully orchestrated slaughter of millions of men, women and children just goes beyond the bounds of any human mind.  Such hatred.

I can also understand the problems that Germans experienced during that time.  It was a massive upheaval for everybody and speaking out against the government was a sure way to get killed.  Bless the few people who were able to hide Jews.  

I was born in 1941 and have few memories of the war, of course, but my older brother (14 years older) was one of the guards at the Nuremberg Trials.  I tried to encourage him to make a recording about it for posterity, but he never would.  

German immigrants to the US that I have met who are my age really remember only one thing:  Being hungry.  

I defy anyone to see these photographs and not have a tear or two in their eye.  

It is sometimes very discouraging to me to realize I have lived through 6 actual wars and quite a few "whatevers" -- you know, when the US invades a country and has some euphemism for it?  Grenada and Panama, for instance, the very quick foray into Somalia.

I now live in a country that has no army and I often think how lucky the young men and young women and their families are that they will never experience war.   |-|

This is the poignant moment when a man rescued from the hell he endured at the hands of the Nazis met his saviour and gave him a salute almost 70 years later.  

Joshua Kaufman first saluted his rescuer Daniel Gillespie. Then he kissed his hand and finally, he fell to his feet, exclaiming: 'I have wanted to do this for 70 years. I love you, I love you so much...'.  

Kaufman, now 87, was a 'walking corpse' on April 29 1945 when U.S. Army soldier Gillespie, 89, marched in with his comrades to liberate the charnel house that was the Dachau concentration camp near Munich.  

Gillespie, a machine gunner with the 42nd 'Rainbow Division,' moved to block 11 of the infamous complex which was the first camp built by the Nazis to house its enemies in 1933. |-|

One of the only stories I heard was that my Dad's father was the person who would get rid of the bodies in the camp. He was 10 years old when he was doing these things. He would have to dig up the bodies and burn them. He would sometimes even know the people he was burning. This is probably why he is completley nuts currently. My Dad has severed communication with him since he resents him for the way he was raised and treated his mother. Last time we saw him I was 6 years old (13 years old currently) and one strong memory I have of him was everday he would go outside and do the [Nazi Salute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_salute) because he still thought he was in a camp and was scared not to. My Dad's Mother apparently had an even worse time but she was able to stay sane until death atleast.

The scary thing about world war 2 is that so much of the regular people in Germany could become Nazis. There is a skill in rallying people for a cause and it is almost as effective at rallying them for evil as it is for good. Had this soldier been born in Germany there's a good chance he would have fought for Hitler.

|-| cnxkwaw || 20 || My grandfather served in WWII as an American soldier in Europe. He used to tell lots of stories about it; about how he got drafted, what boot camp was like, "liberty ships" and how they were held together by shoeglue and bubblegum, I know pretty much the entire story of his service during the occupation; guarding POWs and "repatriating" them, burning/burrying German weapons, hunting to feed displaced women/children (sounds badass, hunting deer in the German countryside with an M1 Garand) up until he got his papers to go home.

The only bits and pieces I'm missing are the ... oh... **entire** period between setting foot on German soil and the war being officially over. He never spoke a single word about any of that stuff. His stories start with being drafted, end when he lands, and pick up again when the occupation begins. I tried for years to coax it out of him, but he never uttered a peep, except to answer one question: When I asked him if it was scary, he said "Any man who tells ya he wasn't scared for his life is either a liar, or crazy."

Actually both of my grandfathers served; my other grandfather served in the Pacific. But he died when I was 7, before I really understood what war was. I've asked my dad about it, but he said grandpa never spoke a single word about the whole thing.

Anyway. This is beautiful set of photos. I'm really glad these two got to reconnect after so many years. I can't imagine what they must have been feeling, either back then or now. Honestly I don't think I could have bore what the men of old bore. |-|

China was way behind this curve. They are doing now what the rest of the industrial world did, and they are doing it from scratch learning every lession we learned the hard way like we did. 

The only question is, can the global biosphere survive the trauma of another billion people industrializing another continent from scratch? If the answer is no, How do we proceed? Because if you ask China to scale back, or implement costly disposal procedures, they will just say that they are doing the same things we did, why arent they allowed to do what we did?

|-| cnxlm5e || 3 || I know from the study of history worse genocides have happened. The Holocaust stands out so prominently because it didn't happen in the "third" world, it happened in the most "civilized"  place on the face of the earth in its time. The industrial and mechanical nature of it stands out, all the infrastructure of the machine built by those who woud be its victims. We have a wonders of the world list that celebrates amazing things like the hanging Gardens of Babylon and the pyramids. If we had a darker list of things we have done as well the Holocaust would be in the top ten there. Modern historians like to flaunt the numbers to remind us the Holocaust was relatively small, but we have to remember the context to learn the ultimate lesson that no society regardless of wealth or advancement is beyond the capacity to commit unspeakable acts of evil. |-|

They were essentially skin and bones. One of the guys became a prominent Israeli artist and him and my grandfather reunited a couple times over the years. My grandfather passed away before I was born so I never knew him, but I recently spent hours reading old letters in the basement of my Aunt's house after she passed away and I came across the letter my grandfather wrote home to his parents when he found these guys. Really incredible stuff. Reading letters like that and seeing pictures like this give some important and powerful perspective. Thanks for sharing.  |-|

They are starting a lot of new policies and procedures to curb emissions, and generally clean the country up. Obviously it won't be overnight, and things might get a little worse before they start getting better, but China finally realised if it wants to survive, it needs to fix this. 
Those policy changes encouraged Obama to start pushing for more regulation at home (with or without help from congress) and other nations as well are starting to team up with china to work on these problems. 

Meanwhile some of the places that should already know better (Canada, Australia) are rolling back certain protective regulations, and taking the leashes off the dirtiest domestic industries.  |-|

While at a labour camp he was lucky and became the servant to a high ranking SS officer. Normally this wouldn't be a good thing, but this officer was strange. He would say things to my grandfather that no Nazi soldier would ever say like "I have a son just like you" and "The Americans are coming, you're going to survive this war". For a 14 year old Jewish boy who had been through hell, those word were as encouraging as they were terrifying. But it didn't end there, he even gave him extra food.

A couple years later after the war my grandfather became a mechanic, learning his trade near Munich. One day on the street he bumped in to that exact same SS officer, but he was wearing a British uniform! He was a spy. They both went back to some British headquarters to explain the story, and then they went off on their separate ways.

I would really love to know who this person was. |-|

|-| cnxr9of || 4 || So if the ratio of men to women is roughly 50:50 why is the ratio on online dating so skewed like this?  Are there a ton of women not dating?  Are they dating multiple men?  What's going here?  Are they dating somewhere else where the ratio is as skewed in favor of men as online dating is for women?

However, I did describe it to a handful of girls as something akin to a mountain's ascent. Every beautiful girl I matched I imagined as a mountain with hundreds of climbers clinging to it. Some are barely off the ground, most are falling to their deaths. The goal is to be the last man at the top. The holy summit. "App-Deletion". I was the last match for at least three girls. All great friends now. |-|

I often feel, when I swipe right on a girl I find mildly interesting, that I am competing in a job market and the job isn't even that appealing but *my* options are so few that I must work overtime just for a shot at mediocrity. And then going on a date with someone who, it turns out, is very nice but shares no chemistry is the real disappointment.

If Dante's *Inferno* were written today, it would contain online dating as one of the lowest circles of Hell for both men and women, because women take great physical risk by going on a date with an unknown guy outside of their social network.

Meeting people in person is so much better. You just immediately know if you have chemistry and shared interest. No dick-dancing with that super-witty and ultra-cool message that will get that girl's attention. |-|

|-| cnxsai5 || 9 || I spent a week in Beijing, and the minute you step out of the airport the pollution slams into you.  I had mentally prepared myself for it beforehand -- I grew up in 1980's New York City, I know a thing or two about litter and pollution -- but holy shit, there's no way to prepare yourself for that. 

To get an idea, stick your face directly into the exhaust of an old car.  Rev the engine.  Breathe in deep.  Now multiply it by five, and try to imagine that every breath you take from that point forward is like that. 

There's no escaping it, it's horrendous -- it sticks to your hair, your clothes, your skin, and you can feel it in your teeth.  It wasn't until I went to Mutianyu at the Great Wall that I was able to escape it, and even then it was in the air, but at least the sky was blue instead of the constant gray of Beijing. 

Don't even get me started on all the litter that's strewn about everywhere.  That city really is a horrible shit hole.  It's a wonder that everyone there hasn't dropped dead from cancer yet.  |-|

The trade is illegal but there are enough corrupt Chinese businessmen and corrupt North American electronics recycling depots to keep it alive.

* had an argument with a friend who was just off the jet about whether it was the sun or the moon in the sky.  It was the sun even though she refused to believe me at first.

|-| cnxuesz || 818 || I met Lady Gaga once. I was working as a small time music studio, and she was still calling herself the Stefani Germanotta Band (catchy, right?). We had just finished about 4 hours of recording, and some of the crew was cleaning the studio out for the next musicians on the roster. 

She was with me in the equipment booth and we were listening to a rough cut of some vocals when she turned to me and asked, "Do you believe in God?" 

I was never one to get into a religious discussion, being a pretty apathetic agnostic, so I replied, "I don't go to church or anything but I think there's something up there." You don't want to get into a debate with these up and coming artists, they have some pretty strong views.

She asked me, "Do you want to see what God looks like?"

I paused for a moment, processing the question. A threat? A drug? What?

"What?"

And she pulled up her skirt and flashed me the most glitter covered vagina I have ever seen in my life. It could not have been comfortable, like aluminum sand.

She turned around and laughed, walking out the door. |-|

It's a smaller park and can be enjoyed in just a day or two. One major attraction are the Lehman Caves, which are rich in features and history and are among the most beautiful in the western hemisphere. There are a few easy and beautiful hiking trails around the park, including one that goes up to a couple glassy crystal clear lakes and a glacier at the base of Wheeler Peak.

The park isn't well known yet, so you don't have to worry about crowds and you can enjoy some very scenic trails in solitude.  |-|

I work in food service, and if you don't know, a lot of criminals work in that industry (we're pretty loose about background checks or drug tests, plus drinking on the job is typically alright). I've seen everything from hardened felons to people that just did something stupid when they were a kid (which we all have done) and it screwed their life up, those are probably the most heart-breaking. Shoplift when you are 16, get arrested, get charged as an adult. Now you've got theft on your record, which means you're having trouble finding scholarships and applying to colleges, even if you worked hard and made good grades. God forbid you stole more than what is considered "petty" (easy to do if you're stealing something like clothing, which can be $100 for a pair of pants), you've now got a felony on your record. 

That means by the time you turn 18, you're already fucked, even if you didn't do any real time in the can. Job opportunities close, universities won't take you, scholarships are pretty much unavailable (except for certain forms of government financial aid). It pretty much fast tracks you into a life of crime. Hopefully one day the judicial system will wise up and discover their policies are just creating more criminals. |-|

I caught a thief today. He came in Tuesday and took a cigarette roller and 2 mountain dews without paying and didn't think I noticed him. He was a regular customer too! Anyway he came in today and I went outside to take a picture of his license plate but a JCPD was already in the parking lot. I flagged the JCPD down and ran over to his vehicle and I gestured him to roll his window down, he made a hand gesture to me seeming like to open his passenger door, I tried and he got out pissed at me, I quickly explained the situation and he said was it those 2 sketchy guys that got out of this piece of shit car, I nodded yes. I went in the store and confronted the thief and he denied the theft, I immediately said if he would like to see the tape, he then confessed and started to apologize. It dawned on me not to press charges and to just have him pay the amount of what he stole and barred him from the store rather than having this guy arrested for $14 of stolen goods. It seemed like I did the right thing because I gave this dude another chance to maybe change his ways and think about the repercussions that could have happened. The dude left after paying of what he stole and the cop that I flagged down immediately jumped my ass saying that I could have been shot for trying to open his car door and replied to this cop that I thought he made a hand gesture to do so. Then the JCPD cop said how dumb it was for me not to press charges simply because he had no doubt that they probably had something illegal on them and wanted to search their car. I then thanked the officer for not shooting me and left. I called my boss and told her what happened and she was actually happy on how I handled the situation simply by having them pay because if I would have had the thief arrested then she would not have gotten her money that was taken from the items. |-|

|-| cnxywu0 || 139 || As a chinese immigrant(i am now Canadian, thank god), I can tell you from Chinese culture and history that Chinese people value money above all else. It might really be interesting as white(or whatever nationality) people to see how we can do this to our own people, but it's quite obvious if you look at our history.

China was a country with a farming economy before Chairman Mao(a total ass wad if you ask me) took over. The majority of the population were farmers. Really really poor farmers. Some owned a bunch of farms(like my grandmothers family), but others (like my grandfather) were just laborers on farms or factories. Chairman Mao during the late 50s-eary 60s tried something called the "Great Leap Forward". It was to help China quickly evolve from a farming economy to a more industrialized economy. HOWEVER, this plan ultimately failed because the majority of the Chinese people lacked education. My grandfather didnt finish elementary school and my grandmother never went to school(just grand____. only 2 generations away from me and I was born in the 90s! think about how recent this was). They didn't have the know-how or even the right conditions to forge the quotas of steel that the State wanted. My mom tells me how they had to get anything metal and had to give it to the state for them to forge steel. ALSO, during this time, Mao implemented policies that had no proven results and some were proven to have failed, many of which led to reasons why the Soviet Union collapsed. Hence, resulted in the great famine. ~30-40 Million people died of starvation during peace time. Dead bodies on the streets. Babies dead because of hunger. My great grandparents died of hunger. When my mom was young, my aunts (they were like 8 or something) would be so hungry at night so they would go to the mountains and try to get edible leaves for the family. They other kids from the city would also try to find them and they would fight over the leaves. Apparently my aunt broke her arm once when a kid tried to cut her with a cleaver over the leaves. All the little rice and flour the state provided would go to my grandfather because he worked in the factories for money. There was eating of leather belts and tree bark too. There's a book called Hungry Ghosts about cannibalism during the great famine. 

ANYWAY, almost every Chinese person you see comes from this history of poverty and hunger. Needless to say all they thought about was making money and having a better life. The inadequacy they must feel from being so poor. The people that are in charge and rich now were the kids during those times (political leaders now had political leaders for parents so they arent so bad, but many rich people now used to live like this). That's a innate part of them so yes, the deep deep fear of being poor again or not having enough money is so deep that they're willing to hurt each other and the rest of the world so they could have more money. Money solves all problems and it brings you food and happiness. Because without food, you're not happy. 

Also, Asian parents are dicks and shitty parents is because of this reason as well. They've experienced awful things and they don't want their kids to experience them. Instead of learning to be good parents, their fear of their kids not having food or money is much much much stronger. A society and culture where $$$ solves everything, including buying happiness. A lack of self awareness and understanding. I bet in 20 years, therapy would be a huge deal in China. There are literally billions of fucked up people. 
 
TLDR: A history of poverty and hunger for generations creates such a deep fear of having no money so they hoard as much money as they can and generate a culture where they think money can solve everything. They're willing to hurt each other because it has been part of their survival. A struggle to get money. If you ask a poor family to kill 10 babies for a million dollars, they totally would do it (Maybe thats my jaded attitude towards my own people)

To everyone saying they're taking steps to decrease emissions and all that, i say "HA". It's all publicity. All it takes is a couple of dinners and a few gifts and a few bribes and your factory can still pollute the water all you want. again, its a culture where MONEY is EVERYTHING. MONEY is your life. That's just my jaded opinion.   |-|

I asked a professor in the art department why they were still buying these things when they had barely enough money to keep the computer labs open, couldn't afford the cd drives that they needed and the macs didn't come with and had tons of compatibility problems with their large format printers and were simply booting the machines with Windows and using them as Photoshop machines.

|-| cny4d5x || 3 || The grain is just preventing the surface from forming a layer of iron oxide to prevent additional rust and material degradation. As the grain scrapes these layers, rust forms that gets scraped off, and so on, eating into the material. This woudln't happen nearly as fast on something like hastelloy or nickel. 

Drying the grain, re-orienting the chute, or adding some poly-coat are all options that would limit this problem.  |-|

|-| cny4qxz || 3 ||  I also work at a grain elevator and this is absolutely real. We change the pipes at our facility every 5 yrs or so. We also don't have a huge facility, but we did start to line the chutes and pill-boxes with ceramic tile and it's much more durable and doesn't erode as fast.

As for people who are concerned that metal ends up in our food; At facilities that process food for consumption there are tons of magnets all throughout the sorting equipment. At our facility we have dozens and what food we make is only for animals. Plus that amount of wear is over months and months and millions of bushels. |-|

|-| cny4wek || 33 || What many people don't know is that this is how breakfast cereals "Fortified with Iron" first came about.

The cereal manufacturers realized that there was no good way to separate the microscopic shavings of metal from the grain product for their cereal. This was post industrial revolution; the FDA was becoming a "real" enforcement agency, and it was stepping up the regulations around adulterated food products. A man working for Kellog named Andrew Wright was on the team working to resolve this issue before the FDA could fine them (or shut them down). By coincidence, Andrew's father was a medical doctor at the time working in the field of nutriton and defining what we now know are RDA (recommended daily allowances) for various vitamins and minerals. Andrew discovered that Iron was on his father's list of recommended minerals, but in too small of a quantity. He tried to convince his father to increase the value to coincide with the amount found in the cereal, and his father agreed to do it on the condition that Andrew pay him about tree fiddy. |-|

|-| cny6355 || 15 || That's due to small amount of amorphous silica in the chaff or maybe the grain itself. Grasses evolved the ability to make silica,  it's used as a defence against herbivorous insects, it wears down there jaws. The silica would have a Mohs hardness of about 5.5, which is harder than steel. 

[Silica in grasses as a defence against insect herbivores: contrasting effects on folivores and a phloem feeder](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16638012) 

It's the reason the teeth of herbivores such as rabbits and horses continuously grow, they are constantly worn down by silica in the grass.  |-|

A friend of mine was living in Colorado over the winter. Blizzard swept through and he was snowed in with his roommate. So they start shoveling, trying to dig out. This was in the foothills and about forty minutes from the closest town. Well they come up with the bright idea of calling for an ambulance claiming to be having a heart attack, thinking ,"they'll have to plow a way in to get the paramedics here". So they call and continue to shovel. Ambulance shows up, checks out my buddy (he's had three open heart surgeries already) and sure enough he was in the middle of having a mild heart attack. Moral of the story may be that being a prick can pay off or those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.  |-|

My city got 7 feet of snow in November. Buffalo, NY. 10 lives were lost, and at least half of them were from heart attacks. The worst part was, it was 7 feet, even snow mobiles couldn't get to them. So be safe when shoveling.


If you're young, healthy, physically fit and have no heart problems, do a kind deed and shovel for that neighbor of yours, you can save a life. |-| 
|-| co90dqi || 6 || Firefighter and EMT here.

We do this for 2 reasons. 1 feel good, and 1 practical.

First, we do it to help our community, as it just feels right.

More practically, we do it because these hard ass crotchety old men will get out of the hospital and attempt to do the same thing again as soon as they get home. Shoveling snow, cleaning gutters on a ladder, taking leaves, I've done it all. No job left undone and all. Often getting them to agree to go to the hospital at all is a challenge!

Tough old bastards! |-|

As proud as that makes me and as great as that is, I wish there were some way we could all feel this way WITHOUT it being in response to some hardship.

It was so bizarre, because it is *huge* -- utterly towers over the town which has no other tall buildings.  The facility was fully staffed, maintained, and everything -- but practically deserted.
 
They operated a club lounge, including an attendant, apparently for me alone as I never saw another person there.  The lobby bar had like three people (and substantially more employees) at peak time.
 
It's next to an [abandoned indoor water park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagaia_Ocean_Dome).  The sheer size of this complex is difficult to explain; something akin to an NFL stadium.

[This site](https://spikejapan.wordpress.com/2010/10/10/phoenix-seagaia-look-on-my-works-ye-mighty/) has some good AbandonedPorn, but even better, the original commercial for its grand opening featuring Sting singing about the resort. |-|

If we guess that 24 years old is when people usually have kids. The grand dad could have been born in '36, the great grand dad in 1902, and the great great grand dad in 1878. So that old man who was born before lightbulbs and automobiles has now been seen by hundreds of thousands of people on screens all around the world ~142 years after he was born.

Elephants are still a bit of a mystery, there are reports of elephants far away from water putting their trunks in their mouths and then taking it out and spraying themselves with water to cool down even when they are far away from water. There is even a [news report about it](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7312442.stm)

I am unable to find the film, but all the reports have suggested that this pharyngeal pouch exists that can store a few litres of water...but speaking to some friends that have dissected elephants but they have been unable to locate this pouch so I am not sure it exists but without it, where are they getting this water? |-|

|-| co9kfi8 || 3 || Wanna know how she feels? Remember the last time you saw a show or read a book that left you in awe and wonder? Remember that feeling? When we cannot see something, it doesn't feel real to us. When she cannot hear or touch something, it does not feel real to her. In this instant she feels that awe and wonder, a feeling that lacks even an ounce of fear.

This is her sight, her way to see the world. I treasure my ability to see, but in some ways I recognize it as a curse. These eyes, much like many of yours, have seen far too much. I hope her sight is never so clouded. Clarity is far too difficult nowadays. |-|

"He doesn't look so good," the farmer said, "but if you want him that much, he's yours." 
The next day the man came back raging mad. He went up to the farmer and screamed, "You sold me a blind horse. You cheated me!" 
The farmer calmly replied, "I told you he didn't look so good, didn't I?" No? Come on guys no need for the long face... |-|

|-| co8ve1e || 316 || Is this one of those non wolf things, where the wolf expert dude explains in detail how it's not? |-| 
|-| co8t50t || 387 || That is not a wolf hybrid.  |-| 
|-| co8ss6v || 424 || That dog is either extremely low content or like most 'hybrids' its just a Spitz breed. Cute dog though :) |-| 
|-| co8qhzm || 150 || Gmork? |-| 
|-| co8u3vj || 25 || The white chest patch indicates breeding with non-wild animals. When humans get involved the white patch tends to show up amongst dogs, cats, etc.

I remember watching a show about minks and how because of breeding white patches were showing up making the pelts less valuable. Can anyone remember what that's called? (No jokes, unless they're really good.) |-| 
|-| co8u30p || 91 || No it's not. This is a malamute cross of sorts. Very few so called "wolf hybrid" pictures end up actually being part wolf.

Nice try at the repost through. |-| 
|-| co8vw01 || 20 || 10/10 would have it as companion for my adventures |-| 
|-| co8v0zs || 56 || Not a wolf hybrid. Wolf hybrids will always have brown/golden eyes because it's dominant over the dog/human introduced blue eyes. Also, big white patches are indicative of a dog, not a wolf. This is a husky. |-| 
|-| co8xh8g || 20 || This is a black husky mix.

Example of similar: http://cdn.themetapicture.com/pic/images/2014/09/20/funny-black-husky-dog-cute.jpg

Perpetuating the misconceptions that obvious huskies, malamutes, akitas and even German shepherds mixes are wolf "Hybrids", results in the these dogs at worst being put down without option to be adopted or at best banned from dog parks. 

When in fact the indicators of being a hybrid are the exact opposite of the stereotypes attributed to these breeds and the traits of this dog, just as others have pointed out. The ears, legs, eyes, coat coloring and head shape are not wolf. Likely if this was actually your dog, you would already know that. |-|

This is more Likely a Karelian Bear Dog http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karelian_Bear_Dog possibly mixed with Husky to get the blue eye or even Malamute to give it added bulk. It's head is much to large to have much if any wolf in it. Shorter noses happen in domestic dogs as they do not need to track as well, this dog has a very short face, very similar to the Karelian. It is most likely an attempt to create something similar to the Dire Wolves from Game of Thrones than anything else. |-|

Their dog shits anywhere but on their property.  Their dog usually shits on my lawn or the other neighbor's lawn.  When I go out to clean up my dog's shit (the small shits) I pick up their dog's shits (the big shits) and just throw them right in font of their sliding glass door.  Sure, I could rat them out to the homeowners association.  But seeing the shit pile up in front of their rear door is more satisfying.  Eventually the homeowners association will see this huge pile of shits and throw the book at them with fines.

|-| co9mxeb || 947 || Eulogy for a dog
By George Vest

"Gentlemen of the jury: The best friend a man has in this world may turn against him and become his enemy. His son or daughter that he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name, may become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has, he may lose. It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it the most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads. The one absolutely unselfish friend that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him and the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog.

A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounters with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens.

If fortune drives the master forth an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him to guard against danger, to fight against his enemies, and when the last scene of all comes, and death takes the master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even to death."

 |-| 
|-| co9j3fl || 1486 || When they say dogs are man's best friend, it's absolutely true. They're very loving, caring, loyal, and sincere, and they can express all of that without spoken language and the range of facial expressions that humans have. I've had two dogs in my life and this may sound cheesy but if there's anyone I could depend on to be that 100% consistent and unwavering friend, it was my dogs.

Good girl, Kallie. Free Time. 

On this past Thursday, May 29, 2014, I had to make the awful decision to put down my partner, K-9 Kallie. It was very sudden and unexpected. The day before, at the end of our work day, I noticed that she was uncharacteristically lethargic; she was having trouble walking, and having trouble breathing. Just a couple of hours prior to that, she was working and seemed to be fine. I rushed her down to the New England Animal Medical Center to be examined, and she was ultimately diagnosed with “Hemangiosarcoma,” a type of cancer that I have since learned is very aggressive, very metastatic, and particularly common among German Shepherd dogs.

 The doctors found two tumors inside of her, one attached to her spleen and one near her heart. The tumors were causing massive internal bleeding, which was causing the lethargy, and the walking and breathing difficulties. They drained the blood that had collected around her heart and that relieved the immediate dangers, but that was only a temporary solution to a very large and serious problem.

On Thursday morning, after a second doctor had reviewed Kallie’s case, the opinion was the same: she had cancer, and it was bad...

|-| co9oe8k || 12 || Lord Byron's Epitaph to a Dog seems very apt to post. 

Near this Spot
are deposited the Remains of one
who possessed Beauty without Vanity,
Strength without Insolence,
Courage without Ferocity,
and all the virtues of Man without his Vices.

This praise, which would be unmeaning Flattery
if inscribed over human Ashes,
is but a just tribute to the Memory of
Boatswain, a Dog
who was born in Newfoundland May 1803
and died at Newstead Nov. 18th, 1808


When some proud Son of Man returns to Earth,
Unknown to Glory, but upheld by Birth,
The sculptor’s art exhausts the pomp of woe,
And storied urns record who rests below.
When all is done, upon the Tomb is seen,
Not what he was, but what he should have been.
But the poor Dog, in life the firmest friend,
The first to welcome, foremost to defend,
Whose honest heart is still his Master’s own,
Who labours, fights, lives, breathes for him alone,
Unhonoured falls, unnoticed all his worth,
Denied in heaven the Soul he held on earth –
While man, vain insect! hopes to be forgiven,
And claims himself a sole exclusive heaven.

Oh man! thou feeble tenant of an hour,
Debased by slavery, or corrupt by power –
Who knows thee well, must quit thee with disgust,
Degraded mass of animated dust!
Thy love is lust, thy friendship all a cheat,
Thy tongue hypocrisy, thy heart deceit!
By nature vile, ennobled but by name,
Each kindred brute might bid thee blush for shame.
Ye, who behold perchance this simple urn,
Pass on – it honours none you wish to mourn.
To mark a friend’s remains these stones arise;
I never knew but one -- and here he lies. |-| 
|-| co9n7pl || 11 || My old rescued pups just turned 12 and 14 in the past week, it is so hard knowing that the chances of one of them not making it by years end hurts a lot and this really hits home. |-| 
|-| co9p46q || 10 || A dogs will...

Before humans die, they write their last will and testament, giving their home and all they have to those they leave behind. If, with my paws, I could do the same, this is what I’d ask…

To a poor and lonely stray, I’d give my happy home; my bowl and cozy bed, soft pillow and all my toys; the lap, which I loved so much; the hand that stroked my fur; and the sweet voice that spoke my name.

I’d will to the sad, scared, shelter dog the place I had in my human’s loving heart, of which there seemed no bounds.

So, when I die, please do not say, “I will never have a pet again, for the loss and the pain is more than I can stand.”

Instead, go find an unloved dog, one whose life has held no joy or hope, and give my place to him.

This is the only thing I can give…

The love I left behind...

He was still used for public appearances and stuff like that. About two years after ending active duty he died. The dog was not just his partner on the job, he was part of the family that his kids grew up with and was the face of the police department (he works in a small town). They held a public funeral for the dog and of the roughly 3,500 people that live in the town about 1,500 of them showed up to line the streets and pay their respects.

It was heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. |-|

A Dog Has Died
BY PABLO NERUDA
TRANSLATED BY ALFRED YANKAUER

My dog has died.
I buried him in the garden
next to a rusted old machine.

Some day I'll join him right there,
but now he's gone with his shaggy coat,
his bad manners and his cold nose,
and I, the materialist, who never believed
in any promised heaven in the sky
for any human being,
I believe in a heaven I'll never enter.
Yes, I believe in a heaven for all dogdom
where my dog waits for my arrival
waving his fan-like tail in friendship.

Ai, I'll not speak of sadness here on earth,
of having lost a companion
who was never servile.
His friendship for me, like that of a porcupine
withholding its authority,
was the friendship of a star, aloof,
with no more intimacy than was called for,
with no exaggerations:
he never climbed all over my clothes
filling me full of his hair or his mange,
he never rubbed up against my knee
like other dogs obsessed with sex.

No, my dog used to gaze at me,
paying me the attention I need,
the attention required
to make a vain person like me understand
that, being a dog, he was wasting time,
but, with those eyes so much purer than mine,
he'd keep on gazing at me
with a look that reserved for me alone
all his sweet and shaggy life,
always near me, never troubling me,
and asking nothing.

Ai, how many times have I envied his tail
as we walked together on the shores of the sea
in the lonely winter of Isla Negra
where the wintering birds filled the sky
and my hairy dog was jumping about
full of the voltage of the sea's movement:
my wandering dog, sniffing away
with his golden tail held high,
face to face with the ocean's spray.

Joyful, joyful, joyful,
as only dogs know how to be happy
with only the autonomy
of their shameless spirit.

There are no good-byes for my dog who has died,
and we don't now and never did lie to each other.

So now he's gone and I buried him,
and that's all there is to it. |-|

|-| co9q4bn || -6 || I'm sure this will get downvoted to all Hell, but here goes...
As a former narcotics K-9 officer I was trained to treat my dog as a tool, not a companion.  I can understand this man's grief, but also feel sorry for him in that his department never instructed him the same way.  I guess I don't know what the hell I'm saying either.  But, he should never have gotten so attached to his dog that he would be completely devastated by its loss.  That was the purpose behind the method I was taught.  So we wouldn't lose two officers at once.  |-|

|-| co9pv8u || -8 || White people have a soft spot for dogs, but not mexican children on the border, 600,000 dead Iraqi children, countless blacks lynched, shot dead 12 unarmed. Weird sense of sentimentality |-| 
|-| co9q3qt || -9 || ITT: more ostentatious grief over a dog than over the 320ish (no government agency bothers to count) people killed by US police officers every year. Bring on the downvotes, sentimental dog owners...

I myself am a dangerously overweight individual who is trying to also make changes in my life.  I have purchased an exercise bike and I am endeavoring to make a daily workout a regular routine. 

I have been told that losing weight is 80% food and 20% exercise which for me is unfortunate because I love food.  Keep in mind that I don't necessarily eat a lot of fast food but I eat some, sometimes.  However I still like to eat food that is not really conducive to weight loss, such as pizzas, spaghetti, steaks, sushi, etc.  I also like beer a lot which I know is awful for weight loss.  Any pointers or tips are gratefully appreciated. |-|

I'm unbelievably bitter about that. 

Still, I share in your joy.

|-| co969zs || 10 || OP, I hope you read this. Please PM me if you can.

I feel happy for your family as your dad has probably lengthened his life span by many years and I would like your help.

My dad is at 350 lbs and I have tried everything to get him to lose weight, he also has type 2 diabetes. In my mind he has been dodging bullets, he is 51 and obese. I need help to help him because I REALLY want him to be there for me when I have kids and graduate from college. 

What type of diet is your dad on? 

My father has problems walking for prolonged periods due to diabetes, how did you and your family help your dad overcome this so that he may lose weight?

Help please, OP. |-| 
|-| co995sl || 3 || I miss my dad so much. He passed away at 58 from similar health issues. He was my best friend and I think about him every day. Seems like y'all have a close relationship. Please cherish the time you have with your father.  |-| 
|-| co9avbe || 3 || I wish my dad knew the things your dad does. He just doesn't care. What are some minor things your dad did that he feels made a major difference? Maybe coaxing him into these would be a good start. |-| 
|-| co8yed0 || 10 || weight loss |-| 
|-| co96tud || 5 || Man. Man after weight loss.  |-| 
|-| co93odv || 7 || He went from John Goodman to Ronald Reagan. |-| 
|-| co94ri9 || 16 || That's fucking great, OP. Why don't you share with people you know, instead of complete strangers who don't give a fuck. |-| 
|-| co98pr1 || 3 || Props to your old man. I bet he feels like a million damn dollars compared to a year ago.  |-| 
|-| co98w02 || 3 || The told me I could do anything I set my mind to, so I became Ronald Reagan. |-| 
|-| co98zcf || 3 || I'm happy that there are some people on this earth that still believe that being big is unhealthy. Good going OPs dad!  |-| 
|-| co99aek || 3 || Congrats OPs dad, I'm jealous.  I'm 27 and cut down from 350 to 240 at 6'3'' but it doesn't look nearly as impressive as it does on him. I've just got to convince my dad he needs to do the same now.  |-| 
|-| co99gpq || 3 || Excellent work! And I'm sure it wasn't easy for him. It's amazing how he decided to take control of his own health and wellbeing - not many people do that. |-| 
|-| co99l77 || 3 || I'm sorry to be the dick here... but the point of these "before and after" shots are to have the same person in both pictures....

Jokes aside, kudos to your dad!  |-| 
|-| co90ztq || 6 || I am a cardiac nurse and this is all I ever want to see happen and I never do. Hats off to your dad, this is really awesome. |-| 
|-| co97jyn || 9 || What the fuck is doing this bullshit on the frontpage? |-| 
|-| co8x2zl || 6 || That is spectacularly awesome.  You have to be very proud of him.  He's gonna be around for a good many more years. |-| 
|-| co92f96 || 3 || My father is 57, Type 2 Diabetic, and very overweight as well. He's tried to diet but always gives up. He blames his diabetes but I know there's hope for him to have a longer life and see his 5 month old grand daughter grow up. You have no idea how happy this makes me, and I'm going to show him this post for motivation. Thank you, to you and your father. He's doing an awesome job!  |-| 
|-| co98r28 || 3 || He must be a tall dude he carrying that 237lb well. doesnt even look like it. |-| 
|-| co999p3 || 3 || Congrats to your Dad! I hope he keeps up the good work and lives a long, happy life :)  My best friend is who your dad was 9 months ago...I wish I could influence him to change... |-| 
|-| co90azt || 3 || You can reverse diabetes? |-| 
|-| co8zvof || 4 || I'm glad he's doing so good.
My father was 59 and about 320lb. He had continual heart burn issues due to his diet. He unfortunately died in August while in the process of changing his diet from heart disease. Glad to see your dad is doing well and on the right path for recovery. It's hard to do but it's for all the right reasons. |-| 
|-| co8yh46 || -3 || So maybe you should celebrate this with him instead of putting it here.  Or find the proper subs...although the potential for karma on the sub where this belongs is a lot smaller. |-| 
|-| co92nyt || -3 || It's great that it only took one scare to set him straight.  My dad stopped smoking after the first heart attack but didn't really make any lifestyle changes other than that.  Then the second heart attack happened, bypass surgery, pneumonia, on and on.  Then he died.

Take care of yourself people! |-| 
|-| co8zow1 || -3 || Beat the beatis!  |-| 
|-| co97my9 || -5 || No one gives a shit about your dad.  |-| 
|-| co9290p || -4 || I am glad I don't have the "genetics" that make me shovel massive amounts of food into my mouth.

|-| co97i3m || -4 || Great job. |-| 
|-| co943e9 || -6 || Please be careful with quick weight loss. A family friend who was in a similar situation (overweight, diabetes, lost all the weight) died due to a piece of dislodged fat getting caught in his heart. The doctors said it was due to the extremely fast weight loss. 

Obviously not saying that this is going to happen. In fact, very good for your dad! That's such good work! But just be careful :) |-| 
|-| co956z9 || -3 || Kudos. He might also want to talk to a dermatologist about treating his apparent rosacea. |-| 
|-| co95sor || -3 || At this rate, in 18 months he'll be only 31 lbs.

And just 3 months after that he goes negative, and his anti-gravity will launch him into space. |-| 
|-| co95z93 || -3 || Yeah Daddies!!! They're the BEST!!! |-| 
|-| co935qi || -6 || Gogo Dad! |-| 
|-| co93q1k || -5 || Wow this is so my story also. Same starting weight, same diagnoses, No results like this :-(. Did he have a good support system ? |-| 
|-| co94nem || -4 || are you john cena? cuz your dad looks like an older john cena |-| 
|-| co95p1g || -5 || As a fairly skinny dude who is told he needs to be "fattened" up far too often, this pisses me off. Push me to gain weight only to then tell me I'm fat and need to lose that weight. Corn fed shit. I'm lean and I'm happy with myself. It has always been others who point, then you get told to love yourself (but don't get conceded). Tell you the truth, I never though anything was wrong with my body until others started to point to it. You jealous? Like wtf I didn't ask you, why you lookin at me. Props to your pops! |-|

In the off chance you weren't aware any US dime or quarter minted in 1964 or earlier is 90% silver and worth many times the face value.  You can also look for 1943 nickels with a large Mint Mark (S or P for example) above Monticello on the reverse.

Half Dollars are silver from 1970 and earlier (40% from '65-'70) And even Canadian dimes and quarters contain silver if minted prior to 1967 I believe.

In any case.  As a member of /r/coins and /r/numismatics I beg that you look for old/rare coins before dumping it.

Also $143.65

Edit: Wow, I didn't think this post would get as much attention as it has so I'm going to take this opportunity to elaborate a little more on my initial post.  

Part of the reason I advocate for people to check their change is because yes, it can be profitable at times.  Like for example somewhere out there, in someone's pocket right now, could be a 1909 penny with Lincoln on the front and an S mint mark with the initials VDB on it.  He doesn't realize it but he's got a penny right now that could be worth $900-2000.  

The other reason, and my favorite reason (I collect mostly pennies, not a lot of profit there) is that these coins are a part of our nation's history.  My absolute favorite coin that I own is a [1906 Indian Head penny](http://i.imgur.com/rZ0vMMP.jpg).  It's only worth about two dollars, if that, but it's a part of history.  It's something that 90% of people didn't even know existed.  The same thing can be said about two and three cent pieces, Liberty Head nickels, steel pennies, silver nickels, and tons of other coins.  They represent a time that most never got a chance to experience but they hold the potential to open someone's eyes to the past.

Here's how I worked it out: 

a Quarter is like .25 of a dollar

those CD-R discs were 52x compatible

52x .25 = 13

Each disc holds 700MB

700 + 13 = 713

That's equal to roughly 60 minutes of music: 

713/60= 11.83

Times ten (tax) = $118.33 |-|

EDIT 3:  After seeing a few posts guessing how much Canadian currency I decided that would be a fun secondary contest.

|-| co9e7qz || 48 || One BILLION dollars |-| 
|-| co9hqj3 || 32 || Let's do the MATH!

Alright, so this case can hold 100 standard CDs according to OP. A CD has a volume of roughly 10,255.62mm^3, or about 10.25562cm^3. There appears to be roughly the same amount of air between the top of the spindle and the coins as there is normally between the final CD and the top when full, allowing me to continue with a volume of 1025.562cm^3. I found a website that gives a reasonable estimate of the average composition of a coin jar, sourced below. 

Given the average values of 42.6% pennies, 8.5% nickels, 17% dimes, and 31.9% quarters, we receive the following values.

Pennies have a volume of roughly .36cm^3. Given .426*1025.562 we get that pennies make up 436.88cm^3 in this jar, or that there are roughly 1,213.58 pennies, rounding to 1214.

**Recap: There are 1214 pennies, or about $12.14.**

Continuing on, nickels have a volume of .719cm^3, and make up 8.5% of the total, or a volume of roughly 87.17cm^3. Thus we have roughly 121.24 nickels, rounding to 121.

**Recap. 121 nickels is $6.05 plus $12.14 in pennies is $18.19**

Dimes. Dimes have a volume of 0.34cm^3, and make up 17% or 174.35cm^3 in total. This gives us 512.78 dimes, rounded to 513.

**Recap. 513 dimes is $51.30 plus $18.19 is $69.49**

Finally, quarters. Quarters make up about 31.9% of the 1025.562cm^3, or 327.15cm^3 and have a volume of .808cm^3, to give us roughly 404.88 quarters, rounding to 405.

**Recap. 405 quarters is $101.25 plus the $69.49 is $170.74. So if my calculations are correct, and my current math grade promises otherwise, you should have roughly $171 dollars.**

|-| co99k7s || 3 || What neat experiences and incredible opportunity. I love to travel, but it's become pretty cost prohibitive. I had the amazing chance to go to Dubai (I'm from the US) year before last and it was one of the neatest things I've ever done, but I've got no big plans on the horizon. I don't know how to ask without being rude, but how'd you afford to do this? Were there cost cutting things you did you could share?  |-|

|-| co9pnbw || 3 || "Battling depression and travelling the world" ooooooh pleeeeeeeeease. You must have it soooooo hard. |-| 
|-| co9otoy || 3 || All of you making presumptions about the OP and posting edgy self-righteous provocations with absolutely nothing in the way of evidence or justification are scum. What does it say about you when instead of trying to appreciate the extraordinary (really they're great) set of pictures he posted you're more interested in finding something to belittle him for because he said he was depressed? Honestly, get a grip.

Aside from that, even if he did come from money, how does that miraculously inoculate him against emotional malady? Are the rich somehow less human than you; immune to the complex of influences between genetics and circumstance, immune to stress, free from any sort of mortal worry? It's ignorant, and while I can empathize, that doesn't mean I'm not going to call you out. So everyone who suffers doesn't have the chance to travel the world (regardless of how much they had done to make it happen), there's nothing wrong with the fact that he got to do it.

"Pumped to get" entails being 12 and having one thrown at me out the window of a car by the kid who's mom owned a local toy store. He had boxes full and to be one of the people to catch one was indescribable. It felt like I just got tossed a chunk of gold.  |-|

After roaming around for a period of time, I stopped a Mexican fellow and (in a broken form of communication) conveyed where I was attempting to go.  As I had no money, I was going to walk the trip back to my hotel.  The gentleman thought better of it, flagged down a cab, and paid the cab enough money to get me back to the main strip.  I have no question this guy saved my life.  To this day, I have no idea who he is/was and think regularly about the sum of money I owe him for what he did.  If I knew who he was, he'd likely receive yearly checks from me to thank him. |-|

|-| cobaddn || 40 || I worked at a home improvement store and was a manager of the lumber yard. We had just opened and had a bunch of new people working for me. We had large glass overhead doors that had a wall mounted push button to open and close them. One of my people decided to be a little lazy and try to open the door with the forklift time, instead of getting off the truck and pushing it. Well it completely destroyed the panel. No one would feas up to doing it. Being a brand new store and the store manager was a complete ass-hat,  we charged me the insurance deductible to get it fixed, which was $200(which I think is still bullshit  and illegal). They were *nice*enough to take it out of my check in 4-$50 payements.

Cut to two years later and one of former associates comes in to say hi. This guy was one of the best people that ever worked for me. He was smart, worked hard, and always would help out when needed. He was going to college when he worked for me. He got his masters in psychology and, of course, quit the lumber yard when he was done with his masters. He had just started working as a therapist, I believe, when he came in to see me. He had told me he was the one that broke the control panel and when he heard I got charged for it, was consumed with guilt. But being a broke college student he didn't want to loose his job and couldn't afford the $200. He said he couldn't live with the guilt and handed me two $100 bills. I tried to not accept it but he insisted and we hugged it out. At the time, we just had my first child and my wife wasn't working, so the $200 helped out a bunch.

I'll never forget him coming back and atoning for being a dumb college kid.

|-| cobacoc || 5 || My senior year in college, I went on a class trip driving from Pennsylvania to Colorado to study environmental ecology. This was a post spring-semester class, so it took place after all other classes were finished. When this class was done, so was my college career. So anyways, the professor was a really cool guy and part of the trip was a whitewater rafting trip down the Rio Grande.

My family doesn't have a ton of money, and I went to a real snobby rich school, but my mom helped me the best she could by sending me a little bit of money for the trip, but it wasn't nearly enough for the two weeks. I felt bad about taking money from her also, because I knew that her sending me $200 meant that she wasn't paying bills at home or buying food. So anyways, I didn't have the money to go on that rafting trip and still have enough to eat for the remainder of the drive home, so my professor loaned me the $60 to do it with the agreement that I'd repay him when we got back to Pennsylvania. I knew damn well I didn't have the money, so when we got back it was about midnight and in the dark among the confusion of unpacking the van, I scampered out of there without paying him back, knowing damn well I'd be moving to Ohio and would never see him again if I didn't want to.

I got a job and got back on my feet after school. This stupid 60 dollars ate away at me though. Every week, I tried to figure out how to manipulate my budget (I was living paycheck to paycheck) to repay this $60 without going under. I eventually got a higher paying job, about 3 years after graduation, and finally went to the bank and got $60 cash, got in my car, and drove to my old college and proceeded to slide the envelope under his door along with a letter very similar to this man's. I wasn't even sure if he remembered that I owed him. I sent him a facebook message asking if he received it, and no response. I sent him an email to his school email address. No response. I tried stopping into his office several times (I travel past there pretty frequently) and he wasn't around. I still don't know, to this day, if he ever received that money, and it still fucking bothers me.

The point of this story, OP, is to make sure you find a way to let this guy know that you received the money and you are happy to help out someone in need, and you appreciate him taking the time to right his wrongs and repay the (unintentional) kindness of strangers. My old professor never afforded me this luxury, and that's his right. But I'd really just like some closure to put my conscious at ease. |-| 
|-| cobb8op || 21 || not saying it's fake, but I do agree with others that OP's post history is curious in that while he has mentioned numerous times he's a small business owner he always says he owns an insurance agency, and never mentions pizza.

|-| coba95d || 4 || About 20 years ago, a GF and I had a small business. She would sell art supplies at home parties, where she would show off the products and take orders. We had just done a party, taken an order, and got the payment. Before we could place the order with our vendor, we fell on hard times and had to close our business, leave our apartment, and move into our truck. Eventually we got back on our feet financially, but never made good on that order. To this day, I have no contact information for that customer and so no way to repay her despite my financial ability and guilt. I think about it often and it really bothers me. I will be forever burdened with my guilt. I am so glad someone was able to repay this debt to you. I hope both of your hearts will rest easy now that balance has been restored. Thanks for sharing. |-| 
|-| coba97k || 4 || Ugh. I mostly order on Amazon, and sometimes through third party sellers. 

At times the order does not arrive by the estimated delivery date, and even a month after that. Since Amazon is such a beast in protecting the customer, I contact the seller and kindly let them know I haven't received the item. They apologize and send a new one. Sometimes it appears they haven't even sent the item 1 month after charging my card.. 

Next week I receive both shipments, the imbursement and the original, swallow my pride and message them that I would like to imburse them for the extra, either through paypal (amazon blocks all email addresses and web addresses in the messages system so I ask them to type their paypal address backwards  "moctodliamgtaelpmaxe" or make a dummy order for the same value filled with stupid things like justin bieber lipstick, hello kitty dildo, and ask them "not to ship it".

Back in 2002 I bounced a check at your pizza shop.  It has been weighing on me heavily over the years and I seek to make amends.

Please accept this Money Order for $654.39.  $54.39 is for you to keep and the remaining $600 is to help children in need.  Please send the $600 cash to the following PO Box address.  Please hurry - they need it right away.  

A further message will follow in 2028.  

Thank you. |-|

|-| cobk8gh || 6 || Once I was kinda drunk and walking home from the college bar late at night, and some poor young guy came up to me (we were both around 20), crying. He told me that he bussed it in from the next town for a job interview, and his backpack was stolen with all his schoolbooks, his return bus pass, and all his money. He begged for help and seemed really sincere.

I gave him $40, and he gave me the hugest, most heartfelt hug I could imagine from a stranger, declared lots of 'god bless', got my mailing address and promised to pay me back (I was a college student, not lots of $) and went on his way.

Almost 6 months later I'm walking down the same street and I see this fella again. I was about to ask if everything turned out ok that night but before I can say anything he bursts into tears, tells me that he bussed it from the next town for a job interview, and his backpack was stolen... |-|

|-| cob8a0b || 3 || I recently had a somewhat similar situation. I'd commissioned some work from an artist online, and was so happy with the results I commissioned more. But the second commission never came in. I didn't really mind even though I'd paid up front, because seriously I figured the total amount of money I spent was still worth it for the art that I did receive.

And then, like three years later, the artist contacted me out of the blue apologizing and asking for my info so they could give a refund. I was floored. I mean, the artist had already gotten away with it and could have moved on with their life, but they actually manned up and admitted a mistake they'd made years earlier.

That was truly amazing to me and gives me so much hope when dealing with random internet strangers. |-|

|-| cob8yzc || 3 || I had a similar experience, years ago. I was the manager of a W.ell known E.ntertaI.nment retailer in a small town. A young man came up to me and asked to speak in private. We walked away from the counter and he very earnestly told me that several years before, as an early teenager, he would come in and steal items from us. I quietly listened as he admitted to what he took. He then said that he had joined the Marine Corps and was leaving the next week for boot camp, and that he wanted to be a man and make good on his debt. He took out his wallet and offered me a hundred dollars, stating that he thought that was fair, but would be glad to pay more if I thought he should. This was probably '91 or '92. I just remember that Desert Storm was happening and all over the news. I waited until he was done and told him to keep his money, that those items were adjusted for years ago, and to take care of himself and do whatever he had to to come home safe. The act of contrition and standing there looking me in the eye proved he was already a better man. We shook hands after, and he left. I always wondered what happened to him. And yes, I realize it wasn't my place to let him off, but I didn't see how accepting his money helped anybody. |-|

She apologized for it, told me how awful she'd felt, and donated a hundred bucks.  She carried this guilt for 30-plus years.  You never know what demons people are wrestling.

In retrospect, I figure 100 bucks is a pretty good return on 5.  Better than other investments I've made, anyway. |-| 
|-| cobjyuv || 3 || OP, I want to believe so I am giving you an up vote. 

The reason I want so much to believe is due to my deceased uncle. When he was in his teens he worked at a privately owned general store stocking shelves, sweeping and doing whatever he was told. It was a small store and the owner could only pay him very little. One day my uncle stole a pack of cigarettes, which at the time only cost about 25¢.  

When my uncle grew older that theft always bothered him. He mentioned it to me several times. By this time he had long since moved to another state across the country. He tried on several occasions to contact the store owner until finally he found out the old fellow had died. 

A few years ago when my uncle was diagnosed with a terminal disease he added $1000 to his will to be paid by his attorney to the closest living relative of the store owner. He said he couldn't die in peace until he did something to right the wrong.

So I basically hijacked the US economy and had taxpayers write me a ransom check that I knew would make solvent my bank. I'm just making excuses for my behavior and providing some context.

I don't think about this much and I'm not really embarrassed by my behavior. I have traveled throughout the country on my private jet and have never thought about confessing or asking for forgiveness. I have no courage nor honor, so I'll continue to steal from all of you and one day I'lll probably leave for the Caymans.

I have worked hard at building up the facade of a solid business over the past 7 years and I don't feel that any of the collateral damage I caused is my responsibility. I hope there are no hard feelings.

Not all Trachyandras will be potential weeds, but it is possible to get plants in to countries where they shouldn't be, so if in doubt, go native! |-|

|-| cobqw9r || 115 || TIL- you don't screw with the king of Jordan. He looks like he's ready to jump out of the plane and start punching them when they run out of bombs |-| 
|-| cobtdl2 || 514 || I'm an expat currently living in Amman.

The Jordanian leadership is in a very tough position. They need to simultaneously support U.S. and their own security interests, they need to appeal to the international community to deal with the enormous number of refugees (1 million +), and at the same time they need to appeal to the Islamist tribes that basically keep the King in power. 

I could practically write a book about it, but to boil it down: The King is bombing ISIS while his government and society simultaneously support harsh Islamic and antidemocratic rules and norms. 

Jordan has very little free speech and society mostly operates on a system where there is little economic mobility. The economy is not doing well and the media is blaming the million Syrian refugees rather than their own policies. 

On top of that, Jordan is a country that is currently bombing ISIS for being extremist. Yet, in 95% of rapes that went to court last year, the victim ended up marrying her attacker([source](http://jordantimes.com/95-of-rapists-go-unpunished-under-disputed-penal-code-provision)). Being gay here often means that you need to flee the country. Women are almost entirely excluded from the work force. 

Speaking of bombing ISIS, Jordan is actually the country that produces the most Al Qaeda and ISIS fighters per capita in the world ([source](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/04/jordan-foreign-fighters_n_6613248.html)). The great irony is that these bombings in retaliation against ISIS are almost certainly killing Jordanians who are just on the wrong side of the conflict. 

The thing is, a lot of these societal issues are not a result of government policy, but they are just cultural norms. The King, who grew up in the U.S., probably wants to nudge his country in a more progressive direction, but doing so too vigorously would endanger support of his monarchy. 

Despite all of this, Jordanians are generally pretty supportive of the monarchy, but they have to say that because bad mouthing the King will get you thrown in prison. 

EDIT: Last year the government cancelled Halloween celebrations and threatened to arrest anyone wearing a costume. [The Atlantic has a good write up on why the government did this, and how it plays into the current political situation in Jordan.](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/10/why-has-jordan-banned-halloween/382207/)

EDIT 2: I thought this post on [/r/jordan](http://www.reddit.com/r/jordan/comments/2uoh91/anyone_else_here_experiencing_this_at_school/) was pretty revealing. Despite the governments best efforts to try and prevent radicalization, it's an uphill battle. 

EDIT 3: I get the feeling that this post is going to get some traction. I would like to add that there is a lot I like about living in Jordan, despite the very difficult situation it is in. People in general are extremely hospitable and friendly. Crime is actually quite low, so its a very safe country to travel in. The food is also wonderful. There are a ton of nice things to see in Jordan. Petra and Wadi Rum in particular are mind blowing. The views near the Dead Sea and into the valleys are great. It's definitely worth visiting.  |-|

You get panthers referring to anything in the genus *Panthera*, but nobody ever really uses it that way. 

You get the Florida Panther which is basically a mountain lion/cougar/puma and not in the genus *Panthera* but in the genus *Puma*.

Then you get black panthers which are basically black jaguars or leopards, they are just melanistic forms or regular animals not separate species but are referred to as black panthers.

!!**YAWN**!!

|-| cobl6np || 36 || My guess is that she lost a pup. It's not that uncommon for mothers in the animal kingdom who have lost offspring to adopt another, even from another species. 

If I we're to speculate as to why, I would guess that when an animal of a species that requires high parental investment births offspring, naturally some switch turns on in the brain which triggers maternal behaviour. When suddenly lost and not replaced, this maternal instinct can go unchecked and eventually the pressure to care for a child grows strong enough that anything will do.

In this situation, even the most well outfitted diver must still appear an awkward swimmer to any animal naturally outfitted for that environment, especially one burdoned by equipment and distracted by the task of taking pictures. Looking helpless in the environment must have been enough for her instinct to latch on to him.  |-|

Found their little dog cowering behind a chair, scooped him up and waited for the fire department to arrive.

|-| cobqsba || 17 || Man this is crazy for me. Like I can understand why he's being called a hero, it truly is a selfless act. That's why it's so hard for me to wrap my head around it. With all due respect to the man, it makes absolutely no sense to me, and as cruel as it may sound, it seems very dumb...very *alien* for me. I have no doubts of what I would do, like others in this thread, I most certainly wouldn't go in for those dogs. I'm not saying it's right or wrong, I'm just saying that if I'm being absolutely honest with myself, I know I wouldn't. I wouldn't even feel guilty. For a while I've been trying to understand this connection some have with animals. Why do people go vegetarian...why do people care about the living conditions of our future food? It's not that I'm trying to be 3edgy5me but I really deep down cannot comprehend it. Does that make me bad? Inhuman? Idk. With out a doubt it makes sense my life is worth more than animals, at least to me, but so many people appreciate compassion towards them it just makes me wonder if maybe I am wrong and should try...try to feel more compassionate? That's weird. It's weird because I'm not choosing to not care about them the same way I would a person, I just don't. Idk. /endrant and apparent...crisis? lol |-|

|-| cobsg33 || 3 || Now THIS is a hero in every meaning of the word. This is what the human race should look at and be proud of. We should all strive to be this magnanimous. No sarcasm for you wandering cynics, I just love animals, esp dogs, esp esp homeless dogs.  |-|

|-| cobl3vz || 9 || 82?! That hero doesn't look a day past 78. |-| 
|-| cobnzd6 || 10 || I'm torn about situations like this, where people risk their lives for animals. On one hand, I love animals and I'm glad he saved the ones he did. He's certainly brave and kind.

On the other hand, if he had actually died trying to save dogs, I feel like such a decision would have been...difficult to understand. To go down the slippery slope, what if he died trying to save a cat, or a bird, or a gerbil? Certainly there is a line where risking a human life becomes less "heroic" and more "foolish," for lack of a better word. I don't know if this is such a case or not, but it still makes me wonder. |-| 
|-| cobsus4 || 10 || This guy should NOT be getting all this praise. It's stupid to do what he did, not heroic. My friends mom drowned trying to rescue her dogs that fell through the ice and now my friend has to live with the constant pain that losing a parent inflicts.

If your animals are in imminent danger, don't put yours in to save them. You're more important than your animals. |-|

Okay. |-| 
|-| cobrito || 5 || Some of the comments here are reinforcing my whole "I like dogs more than people" mentality. |-| 
|-| cobsekl || 4 || I'll probably get burned at the stake for this, but am I the only one that thinks it was really stupid to risk his life for some dogs? I get it. It's a bad thing that happened, and it sucks that those dogs died. How much more would it have sucked if a human being lost their life over some dogs? "I'm sorry your father/grandfather was burned alive trying to save 4 dogs." That would have been horrific. I feel like I'm the last person on the planet who puts the lives of human beings over that of animals.  |-| 
|-| cobra6t || 5 || Dogs are not worth getting serious burns on your face and body over and possibly dying. Sorry if thats an unpopular opinion but I just feel like their lives are a LOT less valuable than a persons. |-|

My wife had a friend from Japan come stay with us for a week. We took her to Busch Gardens, shopping, to a shooting range so she can say she shot a lot of different guns and out to eat. I think going to see a band and some other fun stuff would be in the mix.

|-| cob1cl7 || 16 || Calling them a Lab is dishonest but that doesnt take away from how cute they are. |-| 
|-| cobaxkx || 4 || Silver Lab or not, absolutely gorgeous. |-| 
|-| cobcaox || 5 || /r/aww |-| 
|-| cob7ph0 || 12 || No such thing, it's just a Weimaraner or possibly a cross. |-| 
|-| coay10s || 4 || Is this a mix?  It looks like it has a slightly smaller snout  |-| 
|-| coaxf8l || 6 || So beautiful, does it have a name?

Edit: How do I get downvoted for asking for a name?  Pretty sure that doesn't constitute a witch hunt. |-| 
|-| cob9us9 || -6 || Oh great, just what we need...another mixed-breed mutt being passed off as some cutesy-named "designer breed" and sold to stupid people at outrageously high prices. Sigh. Well, folks, here's what the newest version shelter puppy will look like! Available everywhere soon! |-|

BUT WHO CARES PEOPLE GET A LIFE |-| 
|-| cobfmwk || 78 || Sorry for your loss. I have a similar story, my grandmother passed away in 2004 from breast cancer. She had a nice flannel robe she would wear to stay warm and she always wore it when we had Christmas get-togethers at their house. After she passed, my mom took the robe and turned it into 4 small robes and dressed teddy bears in them, then gave one to my grandpa, one to each of her 2 sisters and kept one for our family. I thought it was a really creative and sentimental way to remember grandma, and I enjoy seeing the bears every christmas.
 |-| 
|-| cobeew1 || 10 || I am so, so sorry for your loss. I lost both of my Grandparents to cancer. I can't imagine the loss that you feel - I'm glad to see that someone was sweet enough to do this for you!  |-| 
|-| cobmfx1 || 6 || I'm sorry about your dad. :( But what a great idea. It's not the same, but you can hug him every time you miss your dad. I have a stuffed cat my dad bought me in the hospital gift shop a couple of days before my gran died. Sometimes I sleep with it when I miss her. 

...I'm 31.  |-| 
|-| cobc3i5 || 34 || In case it needs clarity (didn't want to put an essay in the title!), my dad had cancer. Twice, actually, and though it went into remission the first time, it was just too difficult to cure the second time. Though we knew he had cancer, he deteriorated so quickly that, while we thought we might have months, then weeks, then perhaps days, we only had about an hour between "you should maybe come to the hospital" and "he's gone".

I don't even have words for all the feelings I've had holding this bear today. |-| 
|-| cobe5nq || 5 || Sorry for your loss, cancer is awful, and has taken a huge toll on my family/friends as well (my cousin has been fighting for 2 years now). Awesome momento to remember your dad by. |-| 
|-| cobf051 || 3 || DAM...

I have the plaid shirts my dad wore..

Feel amazing when I put them on.

Stupid 2000's...

Plaid shirts are out of fad..

|-| cobjia9 || 19 || I used to do that as a young boy working for the yakuza.  It's how I would show the *kobun* where to find their *gisei-sha*. 

For you and your wife I am so sorry.  You should not be afraid.  It will be quick. |-|

"Oh, an alien came down and handed me a Pokemon Red Cartridge before tipping his fedora and blasting off back to space, look at how old it is!" |-| 
|-| cobhklg || 31 || My mom does that a lot. Leaves art everywhere she goes. Like an art snail trail.  |-|

Tiny paper cranes aren't that hard to make.

When I was a pre teen &amp; my Mom still made me go to church, I would spend every Sunday morning in the upstairs pews making paper cranes out of the hymn &amp; prayer guide they handed out each service. I would then leave my paper crane flock on the dash of my Mom's car every week. Eventually she figured out I wasn't paying attention &amp; would be better off not going to church. |-| 
|-| cobe574 || 664 || But this is just just a garden ornament with frost on it.  It's not a real frog!

I learned this when someone else reposted it yesterday. |-| 
|-| cobaolr || 170 || *thaws. |-| 
|-| cobje06 || 133 || [Here's an actual image of an actual frozen frog.](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jTEfxqpwyTg/U1-f31LwaYI/AAAAAAAACu4/oziYXxNHl8w/s1600/frozen-frog.gif) |-| 
|-| cobiuvf || 220 || No, it doesn't, that is a statue. There aren't  tree frogs in Alaska. This picture kills me every time its posted.  |-| 
|-| cobd3vg || 50 || If I stand outside in the Alaskan winter, I will freeze, my heart will stop, and I will also thaw out in the spring.  Am I a frog? |-| 
|-| cobi6dt || 39 || unthawing is refreezing |-| 
|-| cobbhm0 || 23 || Plus you suck on them to cure a fever. |-| 
|-| cobl88f || 6 || Isn't "unthawing" refreezing? :-P |-| 
|-| cobmx68 || 6 || Unthawed... Or thawed? |-| 
|-| cobnh2m || 7 || Unthaws!? 😮 |-| 
|-| cobc116 || 15 || What is an Alaskan tree frog? As far as I knew there were only 3 frog species in Alaska - two in the family Ranidae  and one in the family Bufonidae. 

The wood frog, however, can and does tolerate being frozen solid.  |-| 
|-| cobms4a || 4 || I can't believe almost nobody made the reference to avatar...whatever... |-| 
|-| cobo3re || 4 || Thaws in the spring. Unthaw would be to freeze |-| 
|-| cobokhz || 4 || So, it freezes again in the spring? |-| 
|-| cobe9fo || 6 || I'd love to know what prevents or repairs cellular damage done from ice crystals. That's one of the main issues with freezing humans.

Edit: googled and apparently they have a protective solution in their tissue that lowers the freezing point of cells and prevents them from dehydrating due to ice crystals. |-|

Best day ever.
 |-| 
|-| cobkzw3 || 15 || So you mow lawns did you also have a hose to water them? or did the fire department just say"hear you go take this hose have fun, and spray it at the house not us"??  |-| 
|-| cobhrzz || 14 || Queensland - Represent! Brisbane or elsewhere in this fine State? |-| 
|-| cobkq1e || 25 || Your crew?  Are you a pirate? |-| 
|-| cobn3jn || 11 || That wasn't too far from where I live.  Tough job mowing all the parks after all the rain.  My kids salute you! |-| 
|-| cobcc40 || 33 || I would shoot that hose straight up in the sky.  Let it all fall back down rain sprinkles.
 |-| 
|-| cobojs0 || 8 || I love how everything in this photo just looks Australian to me, the yard, what OP is wearing, the fire engine is standard queensland firies, even the grass somehow looks like home to me. |-| 
|-| cobm11p || 7 || Anyone else notice the kickass Holden Ute in the background? |-| 
|-| cobqcom || 6 || I think we found the guy who started the fire.

Mr. Best Day Ever |-|

|-| cobm09e || 4 || Why weren't the fire fighters doing that? |-|

|-| cobdcdh || 7 || Did you drink from the fire hose? |-| 
|-| cobr3f2 || 4 || The insensitivity and self centeredness is mind blowing.  |-| 
|-| cobcm82 || 4 || Op's just a gardner.  The fire is on the other side of the street. |-| 
|-| cobdcdg || -9 || yeah don't post a picture of the actual house on fire. Just a picture of you holding a hose...that should do |-| 
|-| cobq70c || -3 || So....aside from that glaring shirt and a terrifyingly small fire truck, Queensland looks a lot like the US. |-|

Okay I'm sorry for all the outlier body types I offended with this message. The point was that the most likely type of person to wear a shirt like this are fat asses that have hypocritical views of women's body types vs their own.  |-|

|-| cobkkem || 44 || While he gets no points for [originality](http://i.imgur.com/b0uG8a9.jpg)--this particular drawing has been around for at least a couple of years now)--he did a pretty good uh..."copy job". It's preeeeetty clean.

Not like I'm saying he needs to give credit or some shit. |-|

|-| cobb29s || 17 || I really love these! I'm curious - did you ever help them with tiny parts of their drawings? The elf hair on #15 and the flowers in #20 seem inconsistent with the rest of their abilities. I ask not to criticize/call you out, but out of pure curiosity.

Thanks for sharing! =) |-| 
|-| cobbsbw || 5 || Just curious- what is your daytime job, OP? 

These are absolutely badass and I adore the style that came out of them. Your kids are lucky! |-| 
|-| cobhrys || 4 || If this isn't the best way to motivate your children to pursue the arts, I don't know what is. Congrats to you, parent of the year. |-| 
|-| cobaets || 8 || I'm about as talented as your children are with respect to artistic ability.. I would pay money for someone to do this for me.
