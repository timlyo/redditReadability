When I become old and my kids and my teenage, say around 15-18 years old) grandkids visit me, I will destroy this persona of me being anti-drugs by smoking up right in front of them and shouting "smoke weed everyday!" whilst passing joints to my grandkids. Then have a good long chuckle at how my 40 year long joke on my kids has finally come to fruition and die right there and then laughing my ass off!

It would shatter my kids image of me, but I'd die happy at least, the only issue is I'd have to live a lie for 40 odd years and not do stuff I enjoy, but it'll be worth it to die like that.

TLDR: Mentally screw up my kids on the day of my death in order to have a heart chuckle with my grandkids |-|

They hired Jonathan Davis of Korn to write all and perform (in the movie) all of the band's songs. They made videos, that play in the background of many scenes. The movie itself is mediocre, and not nearly as good as the books it is based on, but the soundtrack is quintessential 2000's metal.

The regular mover was worse because it would be 2 hours of driving then 5 hours of moving stuff into a house where you could not touch anything. Then get yelled at by some trophy wife cause i put something in the wrong room.

Government - Voters re-elected 85% of incumbents to government that they could have gotten rid of. This happened less than one year ago. The message from voters is overwhelmingly, "We like where you fuckers are spending our tax money keep doing more of the same."


Consumers - People, including the "workers", only give their money to corporations that provide their wants and needs. People only invest their money with corporations that please a large population of consumers.


Conclusion - The companies that have the big money to influence government got that money from the people, from you and me and our parents and friends and the workers, by purchase, by vote, or by investment. Companies are only wealthy because people chose to make them wealthy.


If you do not like the money flowing from taxpayers to corporations through government then stop voting to grow government and stop electing the same fuckers election after election. More importantly convince others to share this action.


If you do not like the money flowing from investors to corporations or from consumers to corporations then stop shopping and investing in large corporations. Even more importantly convince others to share this action.

Only the people can stop what is happening to this country and the only powers we have are the vote, investment choice, and consumer choice. This problem cannot be solved by more government because government does not actually do anything they hire fucking corporations to do it. |-|

It even used the signature "Sweet!" used in Candy Crush. King (basically) stole the idea, changed a few graphics, added a ton of microtransactions, and proceeded to sue the original creator of Candy Swipe. And they won. Now Candy Crush is raking in huge amounts of cash. However, the creator *apparently* settled it with king, it was probably due to some exceptional lawyers. Candy Swipe still exists.
 
EDIT: Swipe, not swap
EDIT 2: Yes, I messed up some details. I humbly apologize for my evil actions of not being completely correct. In all seriousness, yes I was a little bit wrong. Sue me. However, I honestly have no qualms with being called out, as I love learning. Also, King still sucks. Also, {I am wrong =&gt; I am evil and spreading cirruption throughout the land}

About 300 stories up you have to somehow get *off* the tiny ladder onto an *even tinier* platform where the perky trapeze lady gets in your way with every movement.  Then you wave to lean waaaaaay out to catch the trapeze bar with the tiny, perky little trapeze lady holding onto you from behind swearing she won't let you go *except she weighs half your weight, so how the hell is she going to keep you from falling!?*  Then you finally get situated and jump off and guess what?

Jimmy usually orders 5 to 6 scotch and sodas per visit. He loves to finish one, turn to the young guy on his right or left and start accusing them of drinking his drink. The young kids get antsy and a little worried only to have Jimmy cut them off and say "I'm fucking with ya, wanna go smoke pot in my car?"

**Edit: (Most of) The Whole Story**

(I'll skip parts that aren't relevant so this doesn't get too long. For instance:)

After getting scammed out of 1400 [pre-Euro] Francs in Place Pigalle, my buddy (let's call him Quincy) and I sat up all night, drinking all the wine and eating all the snails and hating French people. Like you do.

I don't remember much of that night. I do remember that at some point we created from scratch an incredibly intricate, amazingly fun game that revolved around sliding coins around on a cafe table. The game is lost to memory, and was in fact gone from our heads by the time we came up with the even *better* idea, which was to go to Amsterdam. We figured if we were gonna get drugged and fucked, we might as well get *properly* drugged and fucked. That was the plan, anyway.

Quincy made some slurred calls at a phone box while I urinated almost pure vin rouge into the trough inside the last cafe, the early morning sun slanting in through the window kicking my brain in the balls the whole time. By the time I was done and had splashed some water on my face, he had secured bullet train tickets and three nights in a four-star hotel because why the fuck not (oh, Quincy has money; I totally would have had my throat slit in the shadowy warrens of that "Maison de Burlesque" if he hadn't been there to furiously pay our laughably inflated *addition*).

We jump (well, we stumble incoherently) onto the train. There was a kid with a noisy handheld game; that's all I remember. Some unknown amount of time later, we are in Amsterdam. We walk (well, stagger under the weight of hangovers so bad I keep checking to see if my nose is bleeding) to the hotel, where we find that we're about two hours early and that our room isn't available yet. So we traipse (that doesn't sound right; we must have taken a taxi) across the street to the nearest "Coffee Shop". I'm assuming you know why that's in [quotes](http://imgur.com/iDoqPHP).

We must have looked really bad, because the waiter poured us coffees unbidden and showed us to a table in the back. We let him know that we were just waiting for our room across the street, and were not in fact going to murder/vomit on anyone. He told us to hang out as much as we liked, and did we want anything else? I, having danced my share of dances with any number of low-level poisons, asked for a nice Space Cookie or something to go with the (best I've ever had, BTW) coffee. *Quincy*, who that past year had only just started drinking *alcohol*, pointed haggardly at the little baggies of purple-and-orange-and-green hanging on the rack behind the bar. "Oh, and a pipe or something. Please."

I ate my cookie-thing and got a nicely high. Quincy smoked about an eighth to his stupid, stupid fucking face and proceeded to get so exquisitely paranoid that he convinced himself that the coffee-shop waiter was the same guy as he who had frog-marched (Edit: no pun intended, ba-dum-tss) us to the ATM outside the Moulin Rouge the night before. I guess it's my own fault for not stepping on the brakes, but everyone's gotta learn sometime, right?

Anyhoo. We check in. I go off and have an amazing three-day adventure in Amsterdam. I (sort of) stop a mugging. I have a brief, painful love affair with an ex-prostitute who is in training to become an opera singer. I see the Van Gogh museum, and the Museum of Sex. I eat pizza. Etc.

Quincy, ever the compulsive consumer, proceeds to smoke brain-shattering amounts of pot and watch hour after hour of gross Europorn in the hotel room for the entirety of the trip. The only time I see him is when I come home to sleep, which I do on the mattress I've dragged out onto the balcony because he has stanked up the room so bad with room-service-farts.

So it's our last night in Amsterdam.

"So it's our last night in Amsterdam," I say to Quincy, over the sounds of *oonCH oonCH oonCH oonCH* music and sodomy coming from the television. "You've got to at least see the place *once*. Anything you wanna do, we'll do. Do you want to see the canals? You want to go bungie-jumping? See the Van Gogh? Anything you want. Just name it, buddy."

His eyes never leave the TV. "I wanna have sex with a prostitute."

"Ohhhh... *Kay.*"

I go down and wait for him in the cafe in front of the place while he de-grossifies. He comes down, looking like a kid tiptoeing his way across the room on his first day of kindergarten. Oh, and he has a massive, eye-catching erection clearly visible through his cargo pants. We head off.

We walk along the canal, eyeing the goods. We explore Fat Black Chick Street; we amble along Terrifying Russian Girl Avenue (Edit: not actual street names). The women are lined up behind glass windows, shaking and shimmying. It's like walking through a pet shop, only with slightly more window-licking. Quincy weighs the pros and cons of a dozen different girls, and finally decides that he doesn't want to do it anymore and that he wants to go back to the hotel. Fuck that. I tell him that we're going back out onto the main canal-street, and at the very fucking least having a drink at the first restaurant or bar we come to.

Which is a place called "Bananenbar".

**(I'm already at 5000 characters?! Fuck! Today sucked and I gotta sleep. I'll finish this tomorrow, I promise. Stop back by when you're having your late-morning coffee.**)


***


Alright, let's see... (*re-read re-read re-read*) Okay, so:

Bananenbar is *nicer* than you're imagining right now, first of all. Have you ever been to one of those giant old-timey one-screen theaters, with velvet seats and and art-deco murals on the walls and Roman columns and signs of the Zodiac lovingly painted across the royal blue ceiling and all that? Okay, well imagine that, but with actual people actually fucking in front of you on stage.

Yeah, it's a live sex show. As in you come in, an usher in epaulets takes you to your seat, and watch people hump. Real weiners going into real buh-ginas. I mean yes, it's done with as much artsy-fartsy as possible, the slightly bored-looking people switching positions faster than an early-Nineties Skinemax "love scene". I would love to be a fly on the wall during rehearsal of *that* show:

"Alright people, let's keep it lively, remember to cheat out with your genitalia, and have *fun!* Five, six, seven, eight and *Blowjob!* Good, good, work the balls, Ingrid... good! Mani, arch back a little, let's see those abs! Excellent! Okay, the shitty Enigma 'monks chanting on top of a dance beat' song is about to change chords, so... let's... go with it annnnd... *Reverse Cowgirl!* Good! Wonderful! Ingrid, do the hair thing--- GOOD! We're making *magic* here, people!"

Oh, and another thing: this is a *tourist attraction.* This place isn't full of haggard, solitary men sitting equidistant from one another and angrily mastrubating under their raincoats. This place is full of lively, happy "theater-goers". Quincy and I were actually seated next to an entire Japanese *family*, two (adolescent (still, though)) children in tow and all. They sell *t-shirts* in the lobby. Okay? So:

Yeah, so we're there. The price was either one Moneys (it's been literally a decade; forgive me if I forget details) or Slightly More Moneys and you get two drinks included. So we carry in our four beers, say *konbanwa* to our seat-neighbors, and quietly and briefly argue over who has to watch a live sex show while sitting next to a twelve-year-old Asian boy. Quincy backs down due to his pants-shitting terror of Someone Noticing him at any moment and slumps down into the seat.

I join him and we watch shaved, sculpted, tanning-bedded Estonians or whatever make lackadaisical love. Honestly, the actual ugly-bumping is the *boring* part. You can kinda tell that these people have been doing it (heh) waaay too long (HAW!) and would probably be in art school or something if times weren't so tight. (what? What's so funny?)

The fun parts are in *between* the sex acts. While the sex actors go off and get hosed down and re-lube and Viagra up and all that, there are little cabaret-style acts to get the crowd pumped up (HAH! *snort*). A guy will come out at do a Sexy Puppet Show; there are Sexy Balloon Animals, Sexy Card Tricks. A guy that spins plates-- let me *FINISH*-- on his dick. You get the idea.

Throughout, there is a woman who comes out and keeps things moving. Let's say she looks amazing for fifty, with dark hair and, what, Eurasian features? Is that a thing? I'm getting an "ex-sex-worker/the Owner/MC of the place or something" vibe. Anyway: she comes out in between the lie-down-hugging parts, dressed in various "sexy" outfits, and gets people to come up onto the stage in these little audience-participation bits. She shows up as a dominatrix and paddles some dude's butt. Gives a guy a lapdance while wearing a fat-suit and bloomers. You get the idea.

Each time she shows up, I joke to Quincy that he should raise his hand and go up onstage. Quincy, who isn't having a good time at *all*, keeps telling me to shut the fuck up. He's coming off of a seventy-hour high, and is too busy melting into his seat for such shenanigans. I keep at him; he keeps telling me to be quiet and concentrating on not throwing up.

Finally the moment arrives. Elsa (c'mon, you *know* her name was probably "Elsa*) shows up on stage in a Carmen Miranda outfit: bright yellow pants and top, a bunch of fruit on her head. Maracas. Got it? So: She sambas her way back and forth the stage with a police whistle in her mouth, then starts spotlighting people with a banana-shaped flashlight, beckoning them up onstage. She gets two douchey-looking fratboys and an Ali G lookalike up on stage with her, and is shading her eyes as she scans the crowd for one more victim.

Here's a less common one: I'd 'never' want to run my own business.

I understand the appeal of it, I understand that I can make more money, but I would just hate having that much responsibility and uncertainty, of having to be the one to deal with customers and their complaints and dealing with every crisis that happens.

I'm a salaried employee at a large company, and I really like the security that comes with that. I know exactly how much I'm going to get paid every month, I know exactly when I'm going to get paid, and as long as I worry about my own job and don't screw up too badly, I know what my future prospects within and outside the company are. If I ever do get fired or laid off, I also know that I'm going to get a severance package and exactly how much it's going to be, and it's unlikely that the company will ever suddenly and unexpectedly go belly-up without tons of warning signs and high-profile news coverage long before it happens. |-|

When fat people see fit people on TV, they seem to act like its the most offensive thing in the world. Then when a thicker girl makes a *song* about being proud of your body, the skinny people start crying about skinny shaming. People need to realize that they're more than their physical appearances. Or at least make an effort to be more than their physical appearances. I get that the media plays a large part in this but I also think that many people lack personality and overcompensate by fixating on physical attributes far too much.

They deliberately make  it difficult to move data in and out of their applications.  Want to move from Quicken on Windows to Quicken on a Mac?  Not easy, lots of data loss.

I had to spend an hour on the phone this week (for a client) with a Quicken rep just to buy the only version of QuickBooks that works on OS X Yosemite, and after paying $230 for it, the only way she would put it on my client's computer was to use Logmein to take control of her computer. |-|

THEN they tried to sue a game similar to Candy Crush except it was made *before Candy Crush. The similarities between the two games are far from coincidental too, it's obvious King copied them. Anyway their case was failing, so what they did is buy an even older game that plays nothing like their games and then again tries to sue this game for copying them. Not only that, but they also tried to sue another game called the Banner Saga for having the word Saga in it and they claimed people could get confused between the two games. No. Just no. That would be like saying you might confuse apples with freaking trees. Sure they are both games and have Saga in the name, but literally NOTHING ELSE IS EVEN REMOTELY SIMILAR. 

That rant is already long enough, so I won't even mention the problems with the game since you probably already know them, but yeah I really hate that company.

Edit: A lot of people seem to hate King as well. Last time I posted this (my first post ever I think) it got several hundred upvotes and since then I haven't been able to top that (sad I know). Guess this is my lucky comment.

I know I work a lot better when I'm comfortable, I feel *good* in my comfort clothes, and my desk at work puts holes in the elbows of all my shirts, so I'm getting reprimanded for that shit. I would also have an easier time communicating in general if I didn't have to hesitate and think about whether or not the phrasing would be considered professional or not. It'd be nice if I could tell my boss "The server's fucked itself and needs a restart before anybody can work" instead of getting chewed out for using 'Damn' in an e-mail one time.

We're all just people and when we get home the whole façade of professionalism goes out the window anyway. We baby talk our pets and swear in casual conversation. Why not just communicate like we're normal average people for a more relaxed yet productive work environment? I know some offices are concerned with appearances and because they think casual wear and making people comfortable deteriorates their work ethic, but if you give me a task and say "I need this done by end of day", it'll be done before end of day. Perhaps much sooner if I wasn't being constantly and itchily reminded that I gained weight over the holidays and my hives are being triggered by every seam in my inflexible office pants. |-|

|-| cnu22rj || 3 || I couldn't do the long rotation-based shifts working on something like an oil rig or onboard a vessel doing stretches of time at sea. I know the money is great, but you get what you're paid for.

There were positions open for NDT techs working up in Alaska, but between the climate, remote location, long days (10-12 hour days are common, and it's 6-7 days a week of work), crew camps without any decent internet and no alcohol, I just couldn't do it.

I think that balance is a key part of having a happy life, and even though you come back with a ton of money for the number of days you spent up there, I'd imagine that you end every day dreading waking up to do it all over again, and are burnt out after the first week.

On one hand it would be nice to have huge chunks of free time, 6-weeks on / 6-weeks off for example, but unless you're rigidly disciplined that time is going to feel mighty short and going back to work will be a rude awakening every time. 

I currently work 4 10-hour shifts with an occasional extra day of OT if things are busy, I'm home every night with a couple hours to cook / clean / relax, and get a nice 3-day weekend more often than not. To me, the balance and modest pay make me happier than killing myself trying to make a living.  |-|

|-| cnu2vdh || 61 || You know, I ask myself this every day.

It used to be, what happens after death? Do we rot in the ground, or get tortured for eternity...we may never know. The more I thought about it, the more it scared me. It stopped me from living my life like I should. One day, I got to see death for myself. I held a man in my arms as he bled to death on a city street. It wasn't heroic or terrifying. It was....quick. Suddenly he didn't exist anymore. When I know how quickly you can die, you learn how stupid this question is. After you die, no one you've met will be able to ask you what happened, but they can ask you how you live, right now.

So instead I then asked myself, how does one live? There are thousands of things I want to do, ans a short time and budget to do them. How do I accomplish my dreams? Do I act brashly and take what I want or wait for fate to decide? Do i open up to the love of my life, or focus on my career? Eventually though, it would be the moment after my decision and I would realize that...well...I made it myself. I am me. By even typing this I'm living. There's comfort in the inevitability of death AND the uncertainty of life.

With my greatest questions answered I would only have one left before I die. Something so constantly unclear I must wonder it's answer. Exactly how many licks does it take to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop? 

When the trivial trumps the all important, your priorities have been reevaluated. To me, I wouldn't want it any other way. |-|

|-| cnu2vxh || 62 || I think that the 2000 United States Presidential election was rigged.

Bush had an enormous political machine behind him in the form of Cheney, Rumsfeld, et al. as well as the legacy of a family dynasty with a lot of influence in a lot of places.  Neither of these groups were known for their honesty or integrity.  In fact, the *only* politician on his team who was widely respected for their integrity was Colin Powell, who stepped down in disgrace after realizing he had participated in lying to the American people to start a war.

The fact that the last battleground state was governed by Bush's brother, and that there was some controversy surrounding the recount, it just seems extremely plausible, bordering on likely to me.  Especially considering all of the other shady stuff that went down during that presidency. |-|

|-| cnu5aam || 5 || Sexual fidelity in relationships/marriages.

Obviously this comes to mind as an answer to your question because of this whole "Jenny the cheating wife" saga that I'm only barely cognizant of. But that's not only it. *Every time* I read stories like this I just cringe, because the people involved are always obsessive and insecure and sometimes downright maddening in the way they approach relationships. Really, all of /r/relationships is just cringeworthy to me I guess.

Why does romantic love have to be sexually closed? I don't get it; I never got it; I won't get it. Love is a bond of trust and understanding between two people that grows through common experience. This is separate in my mind from attraction or infatuation, which is mostly hormones and shapely asses and a desire for something fresh and new to make you feel alive. But for some reason, people conflate the two. 

I love and trust and understand my wife. She's my best friend. We share literally everything. For all intents and purposes we are two halves of the same person. 

But if she bangs some dude she met at a party, or at her office, or at the gym or whatever, that's supposed to DESTROY everything we have? All of that trust and friendship and mutual experience is done because some other guy is sexually attractive enough for her to sleep with? No way.

Having sex with someone who isn't your romantic partner doesn't invalidate your relationship. It doesn't even invalidate your attraction to one another. In fact, it's a common experience in many relationships that opening them increases the sex life between partners. Love isn't a zero-sum game.

I get that people seem to have this unwritten expectation of sexual fidelity. But I think that it's taken way too seriously and not really that important. |-|

If the gauges registered pressure too high then I had to shut off the pumps before something blew. I had to watch those gauges at all times. I was not allowed to listen to music, I could not read, I could not bring anything to watch. Just six hours straight of looking from gauge, to gauge, to gauge to gauge and back again. It was the most mind numbing experience of my life and there is no amount of money I would take to go through it again.  |-| 
|-| cnu5ulv || 194 || This story boggles my mind whenever I think back to it. Maybe I misheard when I little, but the memory is as crystal clear as ever because it was so odd and crude.

After school one day (I was in 4th or 5th grade) I was hanging around the playground to get picked up. I wasn't paying attention to anything in particular, so I was people watching; some kids playing tag, going down slides, typical playground shenanigans.
Two kids get into a scuffle about ten feet ahead of me. One kid pushes the other one. The kid that got pushed says "You're such a wiggleworm"
The kid that pushed him just straight up says "You're a bitch." They were both a grade below me. The worst thing I'd ever said was "Crap" so hearing "Bitch" out of a younger kid shocked me. Then again, hearing "wiggleworm" as an insult is just as baffling.

tl;dr: 3rd grader calls someone a "wiggleworm", that person calls them "bitch" in turn |-|

It's a stupid process, public education here is a joke so there's no way you can not get moved along to high school, assuming you show up to class most of the time. But for some reason some families treat it like it's some combination of a wedding and college graduation. We're talking multiple 100s of dollars on elaborate dresses for 13yo girls, and little guys in ill-fitting tuxes.

Well, my wife(obviously we were not married at the time) wore jeans and a tshirt because it's a worthless ceremony. A bunch of girls in their pretty dresses came up to her talking mad shit about how they couldn't believe she looked like trash, and how she was the only one not dressed up.

Without missing a beat, my wonderful wife says, "this isn't the last graduation I'll ever attend," and walks away. I think some of these girls might have tried to fight her if they weren't all done up in their quincenera-quality dresses.

Sure enough, many of those girls dropped out of high school to have kids with scumbags and live less-than-enjoyable lives. |-|

For life : College. I know this sounds odd to some but college really isn't for everybody and you can make a living getting into a trade school or doing something else. Too many kids get themselves massively in debt even though they don't really want to go to college/know what they're doing "just because it's what everyone does" The worst part is that parents are willingly going along with it without questioning it. I was one of those kids at one point.

|-| cnu8gbl || 735 || I had one in middle school that was a real doozy. Some background:


I had bad acne. It was so bad, I had a pretty high dosage prescription for Acutane. I also have very sensitive skin, so it would constantly dry out and I'd have to cover my face in Vaseline to avoid any damage or scaly gross skin. This was in middle school, and I am also a male, so kids used to make a bunch of immature jokes that I would go to the bathroom and borrow some of the Vaseline on my face to jerk it.


One day, I was determined to go to the bathroom quickly and be back fast enough to where no one would even notice I was gone. I clocked in at 1 minute and 8 seconds, total time out of the room, and when I returned, one of the kids said "wow, Tyler. That was fast. You probably went dry this time and got some good friction."


Without missing a beat, I responded: 

"Nah, your mom helped me out."


For the rest of the year, no one bothered me because all the attention turned to the other kid.


TL;DR: Acutane sucks, but so does my middle school bullies' mom. |-|

Other roommate just looks at him for a second, silently goes to the bathroom and shaves off the whole beard.  |-|

A few friends and I were visiting Paris when we were at a bar and met a few locals. Our group is always up for a party, so when they told us there was an underground rave happening that night, we were in. It was an old-school style rave where you were told to show up to a specific location and were given more instructions once there. What we didn't realize at the time was that by 'underground rave', they literally meant an *underground* rave -- this party was happening in the catacombs of Paris (which I didn't know until later stretched under most of the city).

The instructions we were given had us open up a vent on the ground and follow some more directions to get to the opening where the party was being held. While this part of the catacombs wasn't packed with bones / corpses as the [tourist section](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Catacombs-700px.jpg), there were a lot of tight spaces and knee-deep water. Anyways, we get to the party and there are another ~60 (probably about 100 people ended up being there by the end), were given some MDMA and rolled the rest of the night.

It was one of the best nights of my life, but I don't think I would have the balls to ever do it again. |-|

In port I don't remember working less than 80 hours a week, with a 3 section duty rotation which means that you never get a full weekend off, not to mention going out to sea with no sunlight for months at a time.  You are the first on the boat, last off the boat, always.

The bureaucracy in the nuclear field is absurd.  Rightfully so, as we weren't governed by the NRC and thus were held to a higher standard than the NRC.  The slightest mistake, like forgetting to initial one of the 100 things you initial in a given day, even though all safety measures were in place, could result in loss of pay and reduction in rank, basically setting you back years.  The entire nuclear field, especially in submarines where it is voluntary, is horribly undermanned.  This means that socially or professionally under-qualified people advance regardless of competence.

Nothing about the job is redeeming or brings satisfaction.  You sit, staring at panels or recording numbers that never change, for 6 hours at a time, typically standing watch stuck with at least one person somewhere on the spectrum that you are forced to interact with.  No phones, no reading material, it is you staring at your never changing gauges left with nothing but your thoughts and how you fucked up your life to get to this point that you're stuck under the water.  I once stood a watch staring at one single gauge that did not move for 6 hour.  No chair, not even a tech manual to pass my time.  It was me and this gauge, no bathroom breaks, nothing, only to take a 2 hour break and then come back at midnight to stand another 6 hour watch by myself staring at more gauges that never changed.

I took away a lot of experiences and grew a lot from my time served.  I wouldn't change it for the world (especially cause free college), but that job fucked with my head in ways I never thought possible. |-|

|-| cnu9ub8 || 608 || Nestlé. 

The technique Nestlé uses is this: Find an economically weak region, buy up the land surrounding the water source and grease the political wheels by making a proposal the residents can’t possibly refuse. How can depressed regions resist new jobs and added local revenue? But, the revenue generated by these regions natural resource by and large goes to a corporation headquartered in Lake Geneva, Switzerland.
 
Just so that’s clear, they find places that are already struggling with poverty. Then, they make the poverty worse by damaging watersheds and wetlands, siphoning off hundreds of millions of gallons annually, and leaving the fields barren and dry. This isn’t something that is just happening in Third World countries. They’ve done it in our own backyards.
 
The small Canadian town of Hillsburgh, Ontario is Nestlé’s most recent target. Nestlé has permission to take 1.1 million liters of water per day from Hillsburgh’s aquifers, even during droughts. Initially, the province had set limits on the company’s ability to withdraw that amount during drought conditions, but after “negotiations” the Ministry of the Environment capitulated to Nestlé’s demands that their water pumping not be restricted. Meanwhile, residents of the town are held to usage restrictions, as their grass turns brown and their gardens die.
 
“Under its current permit, Nestlé pays $3.71 for every million litres of water it pumps from the local watershed, which it then packages in single-use plastic bottles and sells back to the public for as much as $2 million,” the Council says.

This is a mark-up of 53,908,255%!!!
 
The Chairman of the Board of Directors at Nestle said “water is a foodstuff like any other and like any other foodstuff it should have a market value.”
 
This sounds absolutely insane, but check this out: Many western states in the US have already long outlawed individuals from collecting rainwater in barrels on their own property because, according to officials, that rain belongs to someone else!
 
And as if having our water supplies bought up by this devil corporation isn’t wicked enough, our precious water is also being endangered by our current provincial governmental and corporate lust to begin hydro-fracking and is agitating to run an oil tar sands pipeline across the province. Fracking uses billions of gallons of water per operation to release the natural gas as it contaminates wells and aquifers, and pipeline spills will end up in our water.

Her and her long time S/O broke up awhile back because he had a change of faith after taken hallucinogens that caused him to have a religious awakening and become a born again Christian. He now hated gays, spiritualism (their former religion), and anyone who denied God basically. 

Prior to his awakening, they did a lot of dirty bedroom things such as her using toys on him, anal play and such. He was now very sensitive about it and denied it happened. 

Well, while they were moving her belongings out, he was bent over in front of her and she says out loud to him
 "Wow, I'm face deep in your ass, just like old times!"

Needless to say he moved her out faster, but we will never let that one go. |-|

The driver of the car didn't even hesitate for a second before he retorted, "sorry officer, I got here as fast as I could." The cop was in tears for the next 20 seconds, laughing uncontrollably. The driver got off with a warning and the cop told him that was the first time anyone had made him laugh that hard while on duty.  |-|

Goldman's involvement in almost every financial bubble:

Then they hoover up vast sums from the middle and lower floors of society with the aid of a crippled and corrupt state that allows it to rewrite the rules in exchange for the relative pennies the bank throws at political patronage. Finally, when it all goes bust, leaving millions of ordinary citizens broke and starving, they begin the entire process over again, riding in to rescue us all by lending us back our own money at interest, selling themselves as men above greed, just a bunch of really smart guys keeping the wheels greased."

They ask for a proposal, that the small company eagerly creates for this giant corp.  GE then takes proposal and uses this to go to the next small engineering company as a starting point asking them for sugestions on what they would propose, if GE where to hire them.

|-| cnuby5j || 631 || Wal-mart. No lie, and not just because they put mom and pop shops out of business. Anybody who's been on the inside understand that every facet of their business relies on actively ruining as many people's lives as possible. Every end, every facet, and not even the consumer benefits, Wal-mart makes the lions share of the savings from their unethical business practices. Not only have they put smaller local competition out of business, but they put a countless amount of their American and overseas suppliers out of business. Whether large or small. They are absolute bullies, and it's their way, or no way. The companies foolish enough to try and work with Wal-mart will either have to inherit the unethical practices and use them against their employees and suppliers, or run the incredibly high risk of going out of business themselves. No matter what you try to do, it will be done Wal-marts way, and there will ALWAYS be somebody somewhere along the chain that loses. Every time. Whether it's the resource extraction, manufacturing/labor, distributor, or shipping, at least one of those is losing. It's not just circumstance, it's part of their business model. Somebody MUST lose. There's been no force or organization in all of American history that has had a greater hand in consolidating and monopolizing so many parts of the economy and massively increasing the income disparity.

I few years back, I was visiting my buddy's parents up in Manitoulin Island.  The whole clan was there, so the house was full up, and I was sleeping in a tent in their yard.  No worries, I've been camping lots.

Fall asleep the first night, and after an unknown amount of time, wake up to this horrible cry from the forest behind the house.  I'd never heard anything like it.  It was a long, low cry like something was being murdered.  I thought "Hey, it's not me." then rolled over and went back to sleep.

An unknown amount of time later, it wakes me up again, louder, and closer.  I look around, realize I have exactly nothing to defend myself with, then roll over again to go back to sleep.  Just after I rolled over, I heard something 'whoosh' by the tent.  At this point, I'm thinking it's some sort of owl or mating call of a deer or moose.  The noise stops, and I fall back asleep.

The next morning, over breakfast, my buddy says "Hey, did you hear that weird thing last night?"  My only response is "Duh, I was in a nylon dome under a blanket, not in a concrete block house."  Nobody knew what the noise was, and some quick searches for sounds online came up with nothing close.  I stayed outside the rest of the weekend, and never heard the sound again.

Fast forward a month, and I'm at my buddy's house, and the kids want to talk to their grandfather.  They call him up in the speakerphone in the kitchen, and grampa Wil asks if they've spoken to me lately.  I go over into the kitchen and say hello, and he says, "I thought you should know that a cougar has been spotted in town."

I get online and after a few searches for 'courgar sounds', find this:

|-| cnuc0td || 440 || An abandoned station, floating haplessly, with volumes upon volumes of records in indecipherable symbols inside. The details are lost but the diagrams and sketches seem to describe a long series of biological experiments. Each concludes in a tabular breakdown of its subject, as if the experimenters were looking to achieve certain values of particular contents.

Further in, an array chambers housing plots of soil, rock, and other terrestrial materials. Untold years have broken down most of anything else that was once inside, but exposure to the cold of space has freeze-dried what look like husks of vegetation. And then even larger chambers, with scattered evidence or remains of animal life. Some almost resemble humans, others much less so...

But something very different is found in a central room. All of the entrances are barricaded with various heavy objects, and once entry is gained the space is much less organized than the rest of the station. Some evidence of struggle is found - scratches, dents, decayed smears of various fluids - but despite the lack of an exit, no remains of the inhabitants. There are some records there too, but they are much less careful and detailed than the others. They show something approaching, looming over the station, then over the whole solar system. It is so vast as to be impossible, indescribable by any conceived cosmic measurement. Any discernible detail would be lost in the grand scale.

And then the records stop. |-|

|-| cnucyd5 || 25 || Pretty much every american health insurance company:  Aetna, Cigna, Anthem, United Health.  Based on this article, in 2013 CEO pay for insurance companies almost doubled.  I'm sure the pay has increased since then and this only include base pay and not stock options.  In 2009, United Health CEO Stephen Hemsley took home more than 106 million dollars in total pay.  
These bitches take home insane salaries, pay their employees shit, deny benefits to customers and then increase their pay.  Also, they continue to send notices about increasing premium to meet the rising costs of healthcare.  Every dollar spent on CEO compensation is a dollar that wasn't spent on a potentially life saving treatment for a patient, shit is beyond pathetic.

A corporation is just a machine that eats resources and shits profit. It doesn't have any goals beyond that and doesn't have any constraints beyond what society and government are willing to put upon it. Now the people that run that beast might be immoral, but morality simply isn't a consideration for the entity as a whole.

|-| cnudeka || 870 || From the previous time this was posted (all credit to: /u/aeisenst)

Former reality tv producer here: So, as far as scripting goes, this is actually a bit more complicated of a question than you'd think. Very few shows feed lines directly to the cast, though it does happen occasionally (see: The Kardashians). However, the situations in the shows are definitely constructed by the production staff, with the direct idea of creating a certain plot for an episode. For example, the producers might encourage two characters to act like they hate each other, and then send them on a one-on-one activity together. Now, we wouldn't tell them whether they should fight or make up, but either of the plots would work well for us. 

The bigger issue that I think most people notice in the shows actually has nothing to do with the producers, but a lot to do with the cast. As people who watch reality tv, we all know what's expected of us. If you're one of the girls on the Bachelor, you know you're supposed to be gaga over the guy and catty with the other girls. Most cast members will even decide which kind of character they want to be, with little prodding from the production staff. I worked on a big dating show, and within a few days of shooting, we already had one girl who wanted to be the villain, one girl who wanted to be the friendly, but not attracted to, girl, one girl who wanted to be the sex pot, etc. I think this is why these shows get progressively worse as they go on. When Jersey Shore started, the cast just played themselves. As the seasons went by, they more and more started playing what they thought people wanted to see from them.

I hope this answers your question!

EDIT: One last note. The interviews, etc, are frequently totally scripted. So when you see talking heads, or hear voice over, that's almost always constructed. I've worked on a few shows where we had to use those interviews to construct completely non-existent scenes from other footage.  |-|

|-| cnudsa4 || 1924 || My parents' friends were on a reality show where they had to live like pioneer settlers. It was so real that it was incredibly dull.

They spent most of their time complaining about how bored they were and asking the producers for more luxuries. The producers honestly spent as much time on camera as the contestants did, just because the only thing interesting enough to get on TV was them explaining why they couldn't give them a washing machine.

As the show went, the producers caved on more and more things, and toward the end it was basically just a reality show about normal people living in a normal house inexplicably dressed like early settlers. |-| 
|-| cnudsnn || 4 || While not the best I've ever heard, there's been a few zingers at work recently.

Security insisted the man show his ID to prove it was indeed his but the guy copped an attitude. Finally, he relented, but he bitched and moaned about it the whole time. As he was walking away I raised my eyebrow at security and said, "Well, he got his wallet back... now he just needs to find his manners."  
I guess the same guy was giving one of our workers attitude later on, and harassing her to work faster. She told him she gets paid by the hour and continued to take her sweet time. |-| 
|-| cnudsra || 8 || I watch a lot of movies so I'm going to say the MPAA. Admittedly my knowledge of them doesn't go beyond the movie This Film Is Not Yet Rated, but the rating system in the U.S. really is fucked (That's my one f**k permitted in this P.G.13 rant). 

You can be as violent as you want, kill a thousand people one by one but don't make it gory and you can get a PG13 rating. Hell you can show slow motion of a bullet exiting out of peoples skulls (Dredd still rocked but jesus..) and you'll get an R rating but if Dredd went down on someone (don't know the logistics with that helmet) he'd get an NC-17 rating.

Also I just wan't people to not be afraid of a R Bond film. |-| 
|-| cnudu0p || 13 || I worked on a few reality shows and yes, the storylines are scripted. The story producers make up the stories usually in an A and B setup. An A story is the main story for that episode and it's typically broken up into three segments. There can be multiple B stories in an episode that are short, 5-10 minute scenes placed as a go between to stretch out the A story.

The lines are usually improvised. The story producer gives the "talent" (not called actors) the situation to discuss or action to do and the talent improvs the dialogue and situation with the other talent/s. The on-camera interviews are done after the scene is completed and are pretty candid. However, the story producer asks very leading questions. The talent will also restate lines so they are easier to add into a scene.

One last thing: Reactions. Reactions are visual and audible reactions to events taking place on camera. These are sometimes entirely fake and are used to cut between camera angles and takes.

TL;DR: The stories are planned out but the lines are mostly improvised. Don't look at it as them lying to you because it isn't a documentary. It's more like improvised, loosely-scripted drama based around people who are well aware the joke is on them. |-|

He yelled "sorry" to the owners and went back to his game. The owner, who was a good 6-7 years older than him, got pissed and started cursing at him and my friends brother started yelling back. The owner yells "Shut the fuck up kid, how old are you anyway?", and he replies "Old enough to fuck your mom!". |-|

|-| cnudxrz || 35 || This one might be a little lightweight for this thread, but here it goes:

Companies will purposely mislead people on how to properly use their products in order to sell more of it. A few examples are: Every commercial for toothpaste shows the person using a big glob of paste when they brush, when in reality you can use much less and get the exact same results. Another would be laundry detergent. The amount they suggest you use per load is often much more than you actually need to use. By instructing you to harmlessly overuse the product you will need to buy it more often. |-| 
|-| cnudxtj || 436 || a randomly chosen retarded dwarf. |-| 
|-| cnudxug || 112 || Yep.

Producers encourage people to badmouth, feed them lines, the overall story is scripted, the fights are faked, etc.

The only time the story isn't scripted is when there's a cash prize, a la Survivor or The Amazing Race.

That doesn't mean that they don't create a story out of creative editing, only that the contestants aren't directly influenced by producers, although even that is in contention.

For example, Rob and Amber were on the Amazing race and on the final leg, they made a flight while the other remaining couple missed the flight.

I remember watching it and thinking it was such bullshit that the plane was held and the door reopened to let them on.

Later found out that the plane was actually on the runway and it was brought back so they could all be on the same flight.

When I asked my source how that was possible, he said that both teams won the money and that it was worth it for a more suspenseful finale.

So yeah, it's bullshit.

This is unlike public companies, where profits are driven by investors, and retirement portfolio managers on behalf of regular folks like you and me.

The owner of the corporation pockets more of the money than he pays his employees. Some don't even make minimum wage, and as much money as they bring in only a tiny fraction goes back into the stores and workers. 

Goodwill is all about changing lives and giving opportunities to many who don't get them, but they're just money grubbers who use that front as a way to get more people to work for less. 

I think that's pretty evil.

They caused the Bhopal disaster - industrial disaster that took place at a Union Carbide India Limited pesticide plant in the Indian city of Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh in the 1980s. 

Methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas was accidentally released from the plant, exposing more than 500,000 people to MIC and other chemicals. The government of Madhya Pradesh confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release though it's assumed to be higher

Further, **it left an estimated 40,000 individuals permanently disabled, maimed, or suffering from serious illness**, making it one of the world's worst industrial disasters.

The plant site has not yet been cleaned up.

|-| cnuelar || 6 || I like to think Michael Jackson will be remembered as a pioneer of his time. Putting aside the controversy, the guy was an absolute genius. There are a lot of people considered pioneers who are actually just the people who popularised a style. Even though MJ took cues from James Brown and others, he basically invented a genre. A HUGE amount of artists today are still just trying to be MJ. To me, he beats The Beatles, Elvis, the lot.

Absolute legend. |-|

|-| cnueu48 || 18 || This will likely get buried, but given that there hasn't been any clarification concerning whether or not I can control this power at will, well, here it goes. 

I would eek out that hour very slowly. Incredibly slowly to the point that that single hour of invisibility could be stretched over days, months, or even years. The hardest part to pin down would be *timing* its use. 

Think about it! One hour is enough time for most people to make it useful throughout their lives. Why? If you're invisible all the time, then you're miserable! Look at the Invisible Man from The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. The dude is in constant misery despite what seems like an awesome superpower. 

I would make myself invisible for key moments. It could be as simple as disappearing when you're boss/most annoying client comes to see you so that you can sneak away to the breakroom or your car. It could help you escape the police, hide evidence, and even remove yourself from awkward situations. It's PERFECT for crossing the border if you're not a minority and you're trying to *enter* Mexico. Hell! If you're a minority in America you may not even get shot. Isn't being invisible the essence of pure whiteness unattainable by even the palest redhaired man or maiden? You may even be able to become The One and stop bullets at that point. 

Getting pulled over by the cops? Evade, turn a corner, park, and disappear as he passes by. Less than 10 seconds and you've successfully escaped a speeding ticket and, if you're black, an illegal search and seizure!

Masturbating? Isolate your power, sit on your soon to be invisible arm, and then give yourself the greatest "Stranger" the world has ever known (because there's no way one can have a girlfriend and write out this deranged drivel). 

The possibilities are endless my friends if you don't limit this amazing ability to one measly hour. Keep track of time spent vs. time remaining and become the first stowaway to visit another planet. 

I think I've covered all of the important bases, but if anyone would like to add on then you're more than welcome to do so.  |-|

Suddenly, my Taiwanese friend drops two potato things in her lap. I laugh and say "haha that was a double fuck up"

Without missing a beat she looks up at me and says "just like when your mom had twins."

|-| cnufwrk || 32 || Race is taken too importantly, and I am fucking tired of hearing modern blacks talk about white guilt and how the civil rights movement was important to them and how we "need more diversity". 

*You* weren't even conceptualized as part of an imagined family back then. *You*, modern black person, don't get to talk about how slavery has personally affected you. I don't go around looking at a white person and think *"Oh man, that guy should feel bad Christopher Columbus made slaves of my people too! Take my anger, bitch!"* because a) even if that person was in some way related to Columbus, he's not responsible for that history, b) even if I am descended, I am not one of those slaves, and finally, c) refusing to let go of the past, wondering whether some random white person is actively seeking out my failure or looks down on me, puts up a giant fucking ass wall that no one can get through.

You want to end racial prejudice and ease tensions? You want people to be comfortable around you? Then fucking stop making your skin color the elephant in the room. I see a shit ton (and I mean, a shit *ton*) of couples between Hispanics and Whites. Even Hispanics and Asians, and Asians and Whites. You think there hasn't been racial tensions between those groups? America fucked up in Vietnam, we bombed the shit out of Japan and put *American* Japanese citizens in camps. We've only recently sweetened our relations with China. Hispanics are still the poster child of illegal immigration with a bunch of retard conservatives screaming for draconian measures to deal with them. Everyone makes wetback and beaner and construction worker jokes about Mexicans and most people don't bat an eye.

You think there weren't Mexican slaves as well? What of the Carribean, where my mother hails from - you don't think there weren't slaves there? That only blacks and Jews were the special case in all of history to be enslaved or forced into contracts where they state they had an 'debt' to be paid off during their entire life through labor? (btw, this was to get around slavery ban laws in Mexico and other Spanish and Portuguese territories). You don't think Non-black brown and dark skinned minorities weren't also lynched and burned and raped during the Jim Crow era? Is that what your black-washed history has led you to believe, that you of all people are the only ones who have a history of being hated and treated as animals?

And yet despite these histories we are able to put them aside and get the fuck along without bringing up the history. You have a *holiday* dedicated to you. You have a *history month* dedicated to you. I don't see a Cesar Chavez day on the national holiday roster. I don't see recognition of an Asian History Month, or how about a *Native American History Month?* We don't have those and the world hasn't ended. You have those, and you still cry about the future of race in America.

*You* are not a special people, not any more than any other people. But you sure like to act like it, like as if there was one big conspiracy against Africans and their descendents and that all other minorities are somehow in on it, simply because we don't hate on the white man as much as you do. To you, all other minorites don't count as much as a black person. A company could hire Hispanics, Carribeans, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, Asians, Indians, Eastern Europeans, Iranians and Egyptians, and you guys would still moan about the "lack of diversity". |-|

I do not have a video of my own episodes or my nose pick.  Here is a clip of the show https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSYqsa1FvL0, which was called "Hello Mrs. Phipps" and ran in Oklahoma City during the early-to-mid 1980s.

Or we will meet with them beforehand to discuss what we can do/say/experience for the next filming session, and we have time to prepare most of it. Part of the filming has us talking on the phone, the convo is pre-planned, no one is actually on the phone with us, we make up  what we're saying based on the scenario that's supposed to be unfolding, and they hire a stranger to add in the other side of the convo to do a voice over long after filming is done to make it seem legit. The phone I use during filming isn't even a connected phone. If you do something they like, you do it again for a few takes so they have their desired angle, if they don't like something you did or said, they tell you how to redo it and do it again. The scenarios they 'catch' us in are pre-planned. While all the events they film are likely to happen, they're still made up, and very highly embellished to make for more entertaining tv. While the premise of the show is to follow us around and film the exciting everyday things that happen, the truth is if anyone had to watch me for 8 hrs on a regular day, it's generally pretty mundane and boring.  |-|

Then the price decreases: I understand that they are not trying to compete with taxis anymore, they are competing with car ownership as a whole.

In my area prices have dropped by 50% since launching in April.

I made $2.10 off a ride on Saturday. The ride took approximately 15-20 minutes from the time I accepted the request to the time I dropped them off... But yet... Partners are making MORE now that prices are cheaper.

The corporation knew that the asbestos was extremely dangerous, but not only did nothing to protect workers. They promoted its use for insulation in every house in town, paved sports fields with it, had people use it for gardening soil amendment, etc. Needless to say, there have been extraordinarily high rates of mesothelioma and asbestosis in years since the mine operated and closed in 1990 and the town is now a Superfund site. 

Even though there were memos from all the heads of W.R. Grace acknowledging that the asbestos was dangerous, they all got off on a bullshit technicality. It's an infuriating case.

At the end of the day, we had the apartment door propped open and were cracking the first set of beers, when a total stranger wanders in.  He pretty drunk but seems nice enough, so we handed him a beer.

He tells us that his girlfriend just dumped him on the Maury Povich show - literally that afternoon.  She somehow got them an offer to go on the show, and she wanted to break up, so she suggested they do it on the show.  He refused and dumped her, so she went on the show anyways and they gave her an actor to break up with.  He sat and watched from home, and he said that she was brutal and that most of what she said was true but really exaggerated. The actor portrayed him as a total loser.

|-| cnuhfg4 || 45 || I work BTS in reality TV.  It really varies based on the show.  

I worked on a house show (where the actors live together for an allotted time and aren't allowed to leave) and that was much more on the reality end - as close as you can be while making anything for entertainment.  Filming 24/7, hidden cameras everywhere.  The producers legitimately tried to hide information from the cast, like what the challenges would be, so the surprise would be genuine and they wouldn't be able to plan ahead.  That said, a lot of the cast would actively try to plan how they would react and what they would say to make it interesting.  Most of it happened without the producers/hosts prodding them - but that doesn't make it "real" either.  The cast is trying to make a name for themselves, so it pays for them to manufacture a character that they can continue to sell when the show inevitably ends.

I also worked on a food-based reality show that was on the other end of the spectrum - extremely scripted.  While we didn't follow a script in terms of dialogue (most of that was ad-libbed by the cast), we did have a very specific shooting schedule for the day, shot scenes out of order, and had one or more story arcs to follow for each episode.  We would film multiple takes of the same scene if we needed to, similar to a feature or scripted show.  The cast and producers even went to great lengths to purposefully poke fun at typical reality tropes (like the usual "down to the eleventh hour" crap in every single food competition show ever), which I think made it all the more fun. |-|

But to those who don't want to read the whole thing, yes, to a degree it is fake. At least from my experience, they took a person with a certain type of lifestyle and turned it into something *so* much more. They saw that I had something they needed and I was naive and took the bait. I was fed lines, told where to go and what to do, told to do things that I expressed my disinterest or concern towards, etc. So while it is true that I am a furry, the "me" interpreted on the show is nothing like the person you would come to know upon meeting me. To be honest, it's still really embarrassing to hear about my episode airing or people bringing it up, even after all these years. But what happened happened, I learned my lesson and I use that to sort of warn others about what they're getting into in the rare case they're contacted by a producer or anything.   |-|

When he gets to one our longest tenured employees, he introduces himself and starts on the "now I'm going to expect you to give me 110% every day and I'll be the final word and and and...." so she interrupts him and says "how old are you?"

In the 70s Néstle sold a powdered milk called Formula to third world countries that resulted in the death of MILLIONS... yes millions! of babies around the world. It was a higly organized successful advertising stunt that tried to convince mothers that the milk was better than their breast milk. They forgot a little detail...

it had to be mixed with water...

most of those countries only had contaminated water at the time and mothers would stop producing milk after a period of time resulting either in babies dying of malnutrition or disease. The milk also made the babies more susceptible to diahrrea and other diseases. READ BELOW.

This is what I call evil!
Armies kill and weapon makers make weapons but it's people that shoot them. 

Here a single company perpetrated an holocaust with very little consequence to it.

Never buy Néstle.

AHHH! Did I forget to say... it's still a 11.5Bn dollar business a year... so I suppose they haven't stopped yet!

|-| cnuhvxh || 85 || I had neighbors about 10 years ago who were on Maury.

he was a skinny gay white man, she was an obese native american bisexual woman. he was in no way attracted to her, but they were close friends. they were married, to take advantage of tax purposes, and she was artificially inseminated with his child.

they volunteered to go onto Maury. I don't know why. I think they expected a positive experience. Maury paid airfare and put them up in a fairly nice hotel, and gave them a spending allowance. I'm not sure how much they were paid to be on the episode, but I know they were.

I had neighbors who were in a graffiti crew, they were ecstatic about the episode, and hosted a fucking kegger with shit loads of people watching and laughing.

the audience was super cruel. lots and lots of pointing and accusations and questions from the audience with the typical, "yea, I got something to say for the .. her .. bitch you ain't no thang, you just a ho!" .. and so on.

they were absolutely roasted. she burst into tears. he sat there looking stoic. they were really excited before they left, and really didn't want to talk about it when they came back home.

I'm not at all surprised to hear that Maury is staged, but I can attest that at least one of his guests was the real deal. |-|

What's worse is that we don't even expect them to act morally, even though they they should be held socially responsible if they accept the freedom of personhood.

|-| cnuivjn || 25 || My neighbours had their house on one of those home-renovation shows, where the show comes in over a weekend when the family is away and does up the whole house and garden.

Watching the show you'd think the few presenters did everything; but there were easily ten times as many people actually doing the work.

I don't know much about how the inside of the house turned out, but the garden they put in wasn't very suited to our climate, so everything died in summer. They also installed a water feature, which I'm pretty sure has never been used since.

The other major fake portion of the show was that (according to the show) the family didn't know their house was being done up. They hadn't been contacted by the producers but they did figure it out while everything was being planned, and I'm pretty sure their friend (who was in contact with the producers) let it slip while they were away. |-| 
|-| cnuivke || 21 || I'm surpprised I haven't seen Royal Dutch Shell.

* Rampant pollution and disregard for environmental regulations.

* Collaboration and open support of a military dictatorship in Nigera that murdered activists who campaigned against Shell's activities. This is the same group that murdered [Ken Saro-Wiwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Saro-Wiwa).

* Filed lawsuits and injunctions against advocacy groups to stop protests.

* Demanded Google remove footage of a Greenpeace protest against them from Google and YouTube.

They're fuckers but that's child's play compared to Chevron.

Chevron Corporation has, that we know of:

* Caused massive environmental damage and destruction, refusing to accept responsibility for any of it in Ecuador, Angola, and Southern California. Overall they are responsible for as many as [90](http://web.archive.org/web/20060621092811/http://www.coopamerica.org/programs/rs/profile.cfm?id=201) Superfund sites worldwide.

* Essentially tried to skunk access to more developed battery technology and slow down the process of development of electric vehicles in order to prevent competition for gas.

* Paid and transported a group of Nigerian soldiers to shoot at a protest outside one of their refineries in Nigeria.

* Done business with Iran in contravention of UN sanctions against Iran.

I mean if you want the image of an evil, mustache twirling corporation Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell fit perfectly.

Want the only job where it's completely legal, expected and normal to work 10-14 hour shifts, with 2x 15 minute breaks (unpaid), no overtime, late nights (no compensation), working weekends (no compensation), no public holidays (no compensation), no time off unless you book a month or more in advance (and then, unpaid time off, and you usually can't get Friday/Saturdays, or public holidays), little to no training (and what is provided is usually incorrect, or severely insufficient), and you're expected to work with malfunctioning equipment (because "it always does that"). 

Everyone wants to make fun of people working "dead-end fast food", but don't realize you are on your feet for 10 hours a day, surrounded by hot, dangerous work surfaces (that you also need to keep sanitary), taking orders from rude, bitchy people who think you're at a "dead-end job" and not worth being polite to, and the better you are at the job, *the harder they work you*. All those 9-5ers are used to a half hour lunch break, an air conditioned office, a place to sit all day, a distinct lack of equipment that could kill and/or maim you, shorter hours, regular hours, regular times to construct a social life, and better pay. 

The "horror stories" you hear about occur at least once a week. I have seen everything from stock not being rotated for 4 months, to a toaster oven catching on fire, to the water heater breaking and dishes being done in cold water. I've seen food be dropped on the floor, and served. I've seen people serve food that's been sitting on the counter for an hour. I've seen fruit salad go out, after somebody dropped a slice of *raw chicken* on it. I've seen somebody chop peanuts with a knife, then cut a product meant for a customer with allergies with the same knife (without so much as a wipe down with a sanitized cloth). 

If you speak out for safety, sanitation, and overall doing the right thing, you lose your job. If you don't you're making the problem worse.

|-| cnujclj || 3 || Honestly the most "Evil" Corporation is the World Trade Organization also known as the WTO. They provide companies the means to remain "evil" in their ways by shutting down those who wish to stop them from what they are doing. Ie Company X is dumping toxic chemicals into a local lake. Company X is told to change ways from federal government as they cannot do this because it is destroying environment and lives of those who live around the lake. Company X runs to WTO who tells the government they have no power over the company as their demands infringe on Company X's ability to make a huge amount of money. Thus letting the company continue it's actions as well as taking a large sum of money from the government for wasting both the WTO's as well as Company X's Time. This is just a hypothetical situation however the WTO has committed acts such as these as well as many more in different countries and situations. Honestly, they wouldn't openly admit it, but if someone was getting more profit by getting puppies to eat toxic chemicals they produce then disposing of them properly the WTO would gladly defend them.  |-|

I asked my SO what was doing and he said "Making sure the dirt from the bike does not go into Dennis's face". This little dog was happy enough to be running along with us, it didn't seem like he even noticed the dust/dirt.

|-| cnuk53m || 7 || To be honest with you, and I hate to generalize, but every single one.

Once you incorporate your business, your company, its assets, finances, and business practices are all now publicly owned and operated (if not operated, then certainly driven by). Shareholders will only invest in your company if they see a return. Now your company has to make money, or your shareholders will sell their stock and you will have to pay them their fair stake. So what do you do? Anything to make money.

Any for-profit company is only in business to make money. That's the only thing it has to do. Think Mr. Crabs. The dude wouldn't open a jar of pickles for his mom if it would cost him more than a dime. Coincidentally, a for-profit company will move to a pay-card to save a dime per employee over a payroll company. They'll cut candy bars in two and sell the two pieces for the same price as the full piece, giving you less candy for the same price, because it saves them a dime per candy bar in ingredients.

Some companies will go much further to save money than others will. Some will pay the employees so little that the government has to help them out by subsidizing their wages and healthcare. Boom. The person who made that decision just saved the company half of the payroll they would have normally spent. He gets a bonus.

So in reality, since money is the root of all evil, ALL corporations are GENUINELY and INHERENTLY evil. It's not a matter of whether or not your company is evil once you incorporate, it's just a matter of how far away from moral and ethical procedures you're willing to stray to make your shareholders a buck. |-|

The camera crew followed us around for a couple of days while we did our activities.  As they filmed us the producer would stop us every so often to have us repeat what we did or repeat what we said or ask us to go into more detail about something.  After the producer found a story line to us she would try to ask us questions in relationship to that story line.  

Producer : "You just mentioned that you love doing this activity as a kid, say that part again and describe how you felt about it when you were a kid"  "Good now do it again but we need to get another angle on you"

When we finally watched the show we were kind of off put because they painted us to be these rednecks from the country when reality we are just from the south and live in the city.

A couple of months ago, one of my college employees started picking up hours again. First couple of days I noticed he was acting a little off, but on the third day I realized this guy was coming in drunk off his fucking ass. I work in a hospital setting and this is a pretty big fucking deal. Myself and my assistant manager confronted this guy who quickly turned into a furious fuck who tried to knock me out with a goddamn kitchen utensil. He ended up blowing over three times the legal limit and had to get escorted out by security. From there, he spent the night in jail. After crying. And sobbing. And telling me I 'ruined' his life. It was all so quaint.

Well, fast forward a couple weeks and my assistant manager had this guy on Facebook. My assistant manager shows me that the drunk/fired guy had changed his profile picture. The picture was of this guy holding up some beers with this really shit-eating grin on his face. Without missing a beat, my AM wrote in the messages: 'Having a couple of cold ones again?'

Also, it's fairly easy to fill tags- it's not nearly as dramatic as the show makes it out to be. Also, they told him to act extra stupid and hick-like for TV.

It was right then, during that writing fit of hysterical squeaks brought on by poor acting, that I realized that we were too strange to not be made for each other.

It's not a sweet moment, but it is *the* moment and there's not point in lying for fake internet points.

TL;DR SO laughs like an electrocuted girbble and I fall head over heals in love. |-|

|-| cnuky60 || 37 || For a change in direction, let's hit up 'the most evil corporation IN HISTORY' -- which was totally the East India Company. You think United Fruit was bad for getting a few marines sent to Central America? These guys manufactured wars with India, Burma and China. You think Nestlé is bad for sucking up all the water in some African regions and selling it back to them? These guys literally had their own beer created (India Pale Ale) that they used to destroy India's native water replenishment. You think Bayer is bad for selling bad drugs infected with HIV? These guys addicted the entirety of the Chinese population to opium so that they could have a monopoly.

They owned an army, owned land, and were slavers extraordinaire. They trafficked drugs, guns, people, and resources cheerfully certain that Asians were subhuman anyway so it didn't matter. 

They directed policy, founded colonies, and conquered an entire continent -- in addition to being far and away the richest and most powerful corporation in history, they've probably had the biggest impact on world history of any company.

Only disbanded after the British Empire assumed direct control of India after the Company's mismanagement caused widespread revolts and massacres -- they finally filed for bankruptcy after the government essentially had them nationalised.

Even so -- easily the most evil corporation ever. |-|

I got too drunk to remember much by the time they started filming things, but I do remember that they shot several takes of the "reveal" using different angles and such (some before Ana even came out), and telling us to pretend to be all excited.

I worked with her son to try to remedy the situation, but as time went on, her imaginary visitors had become more frequent and, according to her, "menacing".

After a couple of panicked middle-of-the-night calls from her, we started digging deeper into what was going on. 

I double checked our security system &amp; tapes and was confident that the problem was inside of her head.

With her son's blessing, I recorded my interactions with her from that point on.

The recordings I made of our conversations are some of the most goose - bump inducing snippets I've ever heard. She stays lucid throughout our talks but when we start discussing her 'ghosts' it just gets surreal. 

She eventually had to move on to an assisted living facility because of the issues but her son has reported back to me that her delusions stopped as soon as she got out of our 'haunted' apartment.

So much more to the story but I'll eventually post it all (with the recordings) one of these days.

Basically attempting to bring American labor standards down to the third world, all in the name of increasing an already-ludicrous private fortune for a select group of selfish, narcissistic assholes. They treat their workers like complete crap, pay terribly, worm their way out of any possible obligation towards employees (like healthcare, vacation, humane sick-time policies, and more), then have the audacity to constantly make those employees watch stupid corporate-produced videos reassuring them that they CARE and that YOU CAN ALWAYS TALK TO US. 

It's so freaking creepy to work there, and I'm extremely glad I no longer do. The whole corporate culture is freaky as hell. Basically comes down to "Do anything for Walmart. Walmart is life. Do not expect anything from Walmart. But this is a GREAT JOB! Do a perfect job every day for 2 years and you could make as much as $13 dollars an hour for taking on 5x more responsibility!" 

Their attendance system is exactly like an elementary school's, complete with "tardies." Everything is impersonalized and informal, management is overworked and underpaid and has no chance at even beginning to learn who their employees are, and again, it's *all just existing to line the already-overflowing pockets of assholes who've gone on record mocking the poor.*

|-| cnulh9e || 27 || I was on a reality series in Canada but it was technically classified as a documentary series for funding purposes. It was more along the lines of one of those work-related series like Ice Road Truckers or something where the camera crew followed us as we did our jobs, which was filming a new program called the Naked News. Fortunately they only did one season. 

Everything was pretty real. Our company used the show as an opportunity to do some renovations and overhaul the program so there was plenty of opportunities to have a story arc for a season.  They would set up scenarios like naked axe throwing, or shooting a segment in the street, or a meeting with a publicist or focus group and run the cameras. On occasion we would be asked a question and answer it on camera for a talking head interview cutaway, and on occasion we were asked to redo or repeat something.

They did not do anything to create fake drama, although they did try to put us into challenging situations, like doing a segment with 2 girls that notoriously hate each other, or set up a 5 on 5 naked dodgeball game. But that was the sort of thing we were already doing. 

Ultimately I think they focused on the wrong personalities, mainly the producer of our show who they felt had a Michael Scott vibe, but really came off as a creepy, rapey kind of douche in the final cut. They should have focused on our camera team who are much more likeable and actually spend time with the naked girls. But of course I'm biased.

**This was after only a year of being on shelves.**

But sales were too good to stop.  They continued selling the drug in lesser-developed nations (mainly India) for several years.  However, due to the international dispersion of the cases and lack of regulation, Grunenthal continued to sell the drug until 2008 (mainly as a treatment for leprosy and cancer) with no substantial lawsuit brought against them.

Fortunately, they publicly apologized and gave reparations to affected people...50 years later.

It's a Friday night, dead of winter, desolate gray, and nothing is going down.  No parties, no one seems to be doing anything, so my friends and I decide to congregate at my mom's house and play Perfect Dark and other great N64 games all night.  

So, there's like, six of us chilling, laughing, killing kaze sims and shit.  We're busting each other's balls, as dudes do.  

My friend decides to make some snide remark about my skills in WWF No Mercy.  Uh, no, not fucking happening m8.  Challenge accepted.  

We slap the cartridge in, and IT'S ON!  I pick my created character, which looks remarkably like me.  Dougie picks his little created Doug, who looks more like Brad Pitt on Barry Bonds' "diet."  

Ladder match, one-on-one, for bragging rights.  Might've even put my Intercontinental Title on the line, because, I don't plan on losing anyway, so why the hell not?  

So, after a solid but brutal match, I (of course) emerge victorious.  

Doug flips his shit.  Now, allow me to tweet the deets on Doug.  Doug's a solid dude.  Good guy, good friend, good wingman, etc.  Doug has your back when the shit hits the fan.  

Doug also has a fairly strange temper, and is notorious for going on hilarious and offensive tirades when things piss him off, and pissing Doug off is a crapshoot.  Doug gets pissed at the silliest shit.  

Anyway, Doug goes on this insane tirade about how he fucked "[my] girl" the previous night.  Spoiler alert:  I was single.  

Anyway, Doug keeps coming up with this hilarious and witty (for a 16-year-old dude) euphemisms and entendres about how he railed my supposed girl's pussy all night, ran the train on her by cloning his dick, jizzed in her b-hole, etc.  

He went on for about three solid minutes with this inane kerfuffle, and all the while, all our boys are cracking up, with "ooohs" and "daaaamns" abound.  

I sit there calmly.  

I wait.  

Doug finishes, and, breathing heavily, growls "what the FUCK you gonna say about THAT?!"  

I look at the ground.  I look at our friends.  Everyone is waiting in complete silence, still reeling from the graphic descriptions of Doug's simultaneous adventures and misadventures in and around all of my nonexistent lover's orifices the prior night.  

I look at Doug, and I say "well, man… it's YOUR mother."  

The room explodes.  

I win.  

Still Intercontinental Champion.   |-|

I'm a female who works summers at a Boy Scout camp. One summer, there was a very pretty girl named Sina working on staff. Pretty, very dumb, but nice enough. She and I were friends, and she would often get looks from campers, all boys aged 11-17. We are obviously not supposed to interact with campers outside of a student/teacher relationship, and sharing personal information with them, even age, where we go to school, etc, is frowned upon. Campers are horny boys and usually don't know this/don't care. One day while teaching a merit badge session, I had the following exchange with a 14-year-old scout:

**Scout:** So uh, Nicely. How old is Sina?

**Me:** Why, are you looking for a babysitter?

His friends and other kids in the merit badge session all started screaming and hollering and laughing at him and I felt like the biggest badass ever for shutting down a 14-year-old. Then I felt bad for shutting down a 14-year-old. |-|

In response to this drug, it lead me to have multiple long lasting side effects that have effected my mental and physical health. It took me about 2 years to get back to a normal state. From that period I have complete memory loss. Getting off of the medication lead me to having brain zaps (Google it) and I was left unemotional and cold for a long period of time; even now I can't feel feelings in the same way like I used to. 

For some reason I think it ruined my development during puberty. &lt;edited some info out&gt; I stopped growing around the same time I was on it and some other things. 

It effected me personally and if they didn't illegally trick doctors into thinking it was okay, I would have not dealt with this.

That night, he came back to the house and stayed with me until my mom and brother got back in town a couple days later. Once they returned, he stayed a few more days helping my family with errands, chores, and meals so we could focus on my grandmother. He is wonderful and provided my family (whom he didn't know very well at the time) with so much relief and moral support during a really difficult time. |-|

|-| cnum5ig || 24 || A post a while back on /r/morbidreality had a recording of a guy who killed 2 teens. They had apparently broken into his house a few times before and stole some shit. He had this delusional "The system has failed. It's time to take the law into my own hands." feeling and didn't report anything. He just waited in his house with a gun. While waiting, he doesn't say a word. The murder is almost deceivingly quick. No conflict. No threats, no yelling, no time to react. You cold tell he shot as soon as they were in view. He just waits in his basement and shoots both a young (and stupid, breaking into people's homes) guy and girl dead. You can hear her alive for a sec sort of half-crying/whimpering until it all goes silent and this dude just mutters to himself into the recorder about how he's in the right for killing them and all kinds of other crazy shit. Was gonna dig up the link, but I don't wanna listen to that shit again. I get self defense within your home, but these are dumbass teens. They probably would have freaked and ran if they thought anyone was home, much less armed. |-|

The "stars" had heavy security and their own VIP area. They were supplied with lots of alcohol at their booth. The cameras followed them around with security just off camera. They appeared to want to get shots of them with the go-go dancers. The "stars" minimally interacted with other people in the club despite it being very crowded.

There WAS however some editing trickery that was done on the show to make some things more dramatic.  There was a time when the editors made it look like my father and I were planning something in our rooms, when it was only a comment said in passing.

|-| cnumg1a || 62 || I worked as a PA on a Battle of the Bands show a few years ago, and it was completely real. The bands were all legit, and were desperately hoping for their big break.

However, there were a lot of things the producers did to influence situations. One of them was using the closed food court of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a holding area that the bands weren't allowed to leave, telling them lunch would be provided at a certain time, and then waiting an additional two hours to feed them. None of this was filmed. It was simply to make them angry so they would get better footage when they *were* on camera.

I was in charge of guarding the entrance/exit. It eventually took on a Lord of the Flies type atmosphere. Someone threatened to kill, cook, and eat me.

But the worst thing, in my opinion, was that the producers wouldn't let them walk around the museum. The bands were mainly punk and metal, and there was a gigantic case filled with Ramones memorabilia that they were all pining for. I think that caused more of an issue than anything. |-|

It kept going, some with static, some with threats that I can't remember anymore, but it was like a 10 minute message. I noped it right out of there and called the cops from the gas station down the road to check out the house for me.

As the night progresses Im listening to them talk about something unimportant. And my German friend starts getting frustrated with my English friends heavy accent and use of slang. So he says to him "hey could you please stop using so much slang and tone down the thick accent?

He told me that they also were paid $25,000 ish to follow along with a loose script. 

Meaning like mainly they had to play up the neatness and stuff, and maybe some lines were fed to them but overall not 100% of the lines were scripted. They aren't actors after all, they aren't used to reading an entire script and memorizing it. So basically just given pointers, and paid as incentive to follow them.  |-|

Nothing said or acted was faked, although they did put us in situations that would lead to spectacular reactions. For example, there were elections for the town council, with requisite campaigning and rivalries. The challenges were also pretty physically strenuous and we had to award $20,000 to a kid every episode, which caused a whole other level of craziness.  |-| 
|-| cnundr1 || 4 || When we first had sex and I had my first orgasm from intercourse in my life. Sounds kind of superficial, but I'd known him for a few years, we'd been dating for a while, although he'd previously declined to make teh sex with me for a while (twas gentlemanly in retrospect). He was so fun to be with, and I felt completely able to be myself around him. When I finally convinced him we were serious enough to do the deed, I wasn't really expecting much, since my only other, disappointing former relationship had led me to believe I wasn't even capable of vaginal orgasms. Didn't take long, but he put me on top and proved my previously conceived notions wrong, and I pretty much knew at that moment I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him (barring anything fucked up that came up.) 

There've been moments since then that have reaffirmed my decision; but that was the big "I'm not letting this one go" moment. Next year will be our ten year anniversary, so, so far, so good.

TL;DR: He was "the one" before it, but physical aspects of our relationship sealed the deal.  |-|

My grandfather finally turned to me and said "you sound like one of those dolls with the string, 'can I have a water, can I have a water' haha" and made the motion of pulling the string out of the doll. 
My mother tells me, that without hesitation, I turned to him and said "get me another beer, get me another beer" and mocked the string pull. |-|

The kids were shoeless and running around the store causing a ruckus and occasionally knocking things off the shelf. The woman was just letting them run wild, while she played on her phone

The manager walks up to her and says "Are these your boys?"

The woman sneers at him, "Yeah," in one of those whachu-gonna-do-about-it tones.

The manager says, "Are they twins?"

The woman says, "No moron, Joey's five and Johnny's eight. I can't believe you thought they were twins."

He looks her dead in the eye and says, "I can't believe you got laid twice." |-|

It was always some freaky crap they'd be "in search of" - UFO's, Bigfoot, the Loch Ness Monster, ghosts- for an 8 year old, hearing that shit scared the crap out of me.

Secondly  I think people are failing to understand how history works. What may seem unimportant and useless now could literally be more important than anything else to mankind in 500 years. Maybe hydrogen fuel cells become the most important source of energy  in the world and therefore every little boy and girl at school learns about the first hydrogen fuel cell cars and the engineers that made them. A long shot I know, but I'm just trying to demonstrate how tough it is to make an informed choice or dismiss one. |-|

At the very beginning of our relationship, I found out my dad was dying. Then on Valentine's Day (a Thurs), I was told my dad wouldn't make it though the weekend (he held on until the following Tues). During this time, my SO made himself available the entire time, despite needing sleep because he was so far ahead of me. I was at the hospital pretty much 24/7 for days, and he was constantly talking to me, trying to make me feel better, trying to distract me, whatever I needed. He was just amazing with me. If he could have, I know he would have been there with me.

Nearly 2 years later, he continues to be amazing, loving. I can talk to him about anything, I'm so comfortable with him, and I trust him and love him.

I know we are still in a relatively new relationship, and it's still long distance (though we have visited each other 5 times so far for 2-3 weeks at a time) but I really want to spend the rest of my life with him and he feels the same. |-| 
|-| cnuodmp || 9 || We started long distance. My aha moment was when he left to go back to his hometown the third time he visited me.

He treats me like a queen and I try to spoil him as often as I can.  |-|

As she was getting her refund, the man calmly grabbed her credit card from her and tossed it out the door. She turned to him and the conversation went as follows:

'What's wrong with you, don't touch my property, I'll have you arrested!'

Also the timing is not true to tape. Producers are walking around making sure everyone is going to get their dish finished or at least very close for suspense.

The woman behind my dad tried to skip in front of him, but he got to the counter first and started placing items on the belt. The woman tapped him sharply on the shoulder (which is one of my dad's biggest pet peeves) and said, "Excuse me, sir? I was just wondering when exactly they did away with, 'Ladies First.'"

My dad responded, "Probably right after they did away with ladies."

A decade later, I got to show exactly how much I learned from him.

While waiting in line at the pharmacy, the woman in front of me was next to pay, but she got out of line to grab some more items. The cashier got tired of waiting for her to come back and started ringing me up instead. The woman got all pissy when she got back to the counter and said, "Excuse me? I was next!

|-| cnup3x8 || 3 || So this is pretty mild compared to what most others have shared, but it had a memorable and haunting impact to me. It was something I heard at MoMA back in 2013:

&gt; [Study for Strings](http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2013/soundings/artists/11/works/) is a contemporary interpretation of an eponymous 1943 orchestral work by Pavel Haas (Czech, 1899–1944), who composed the score while imprisoned in the Theresienstadt concentration camp in what is now the Czech Republic. The Nazis filmed a performance of the completed work at the camp as part of the 1944 propaganda film Teresiendstadt. Almost immediately after filming was completed, Haas and many members of the prisoners' orchestra were killed. The conductor, Karel Ančerl (Czech, 1908–1973), survived the Holocaust, and after the war he reconstructed the composition.

&gt; For her 2012 reworking, Philipsz has isolated only the viola and cello parts. Recorded onto multiple channels, the piece is a note-by-note deconstruction of the original composition, replete with fraught silence. These charged absences call attention to the fact that other instruments—and the musicians who played them—are absent. |-| 
|-| cnup496 || 65 || You know how sometimes you have a big bowl of macaroni and cheese and you can't get enough of it? You eat and eat and even after you're full you keep eating? And then you get so sad when it's gone? And you look forward to when you get to eat macaroni and cheese next? 

One day, I noticed I loved him more than macaroni and cheese. Being with him was like eating the macaroni and cheese and you don't notice you get full until it's too late, but even then it's totally worth it. And not being with him (loooooong distance for 4 years) was like having constant "just finished all my macaroni and cheese" disappointment.

|-| cnup5uo || 4 || I was on slime time live. The competition was fierce. I did not emerge victorious.  |-| 
|-| cnup726 || 7 || I worked on two reality shows that aired. One was on TLC and the other on MTV. Both were from the production company that made The Jersey Shore.

The entire plot is scripted for the first one as in the activities they did. It was about a Mormon family who have two children and the wife got pregnant with quintuplets. The control room where the video feed from the cameras was in was staged in the garage of the home. The owner of the production company was the lead director. The few directors, directing the camera operators, were talking trash about the family as they recorded it. One of the directors, who worked on the Jersey shore, was basically bitching about wanting to go back to work on the next Jersey Shore. 

The second one aired on MTV. It was about people who wanted to get their exes back but the exes are tricked to meet them saying that they are on the show for a big surprise whether it was a trip or meeting a celebrity. When they got the location where they revealed the surprise the former boyfriend or girlfriend was there trying to woo back the ex. The ex's reaction was very genuine. For one of the revelations I was gripping lighting and had to stand by the light stand because of the strong winds at the location so I got to see the entire process. The producer for that person was pushing for a type of reaction and lines from both people after the genuine surprise occurred. That show was pretty efficient in its turnaround. Basically for each person it would take two days to do a complete episode and the show was in my city for two weeks so they did at least 7 episodes. There were teams where one went to the ex and the other to the person getting back together to get the back story. The following day they filmed the surprise/revelation. 

The people on that show were very friendly compared to the people on the Mormon family show (the owner of the production company was not there). Shooting would last 12 hours for each team. The is one that starts early in the morning (around 6) and finishes around 6 PM and the other started later and would end around 11 PM. The later team would film the green screen interviews that you see in any reality tv show.

Bottom line: the shows are staged and the producers/directors coerce reactions by the participants. The shows pay very well so I got minimum $200 a day for work plus overtime if needed. The camera operators on the show were working would make $600/day. Unless you were a director/producer or a camera operator the work is pretty boring. For the one with the Mormon family there was a few days of set up but nothing else. We would be on stand by for days just in case something broke and needed to be fixed. The exes show changed locations each day so it involved a lot of travel and moving camera equipment, lighting/grip, monitors for directors/producers, and other production tools. |-|

But I saw the message from a girl he programmed as "bootycall Brittany" and it said "What are you up to? It's been a while since we've hung out."

I walked out of the room and sat on the couch, and I burst into tears. Not because a girl texted him, not because I suspected him of cheating, not because of jealousy... But because in that moment when I saw the first ever threat to our relationship, the truth that I had spent so long trying to deny was completely and glaringly obvious.

I was in love with him. I would never be the same. I could never, ever be without him again. He was my person.

He came to the couch and hugged me, trying to explain he hasn't talked to her since we met each other 7 months ago, and he was deleting her number, and I mumbled something like "That's not why I'm crying" and he said "Well then why?" And I took a deep breath and said for the first time "Because I love you" and he said (and I'll never forget this because it was just so oblivious and innocent)   
"Don't worry, I won't tell anyone."

He thought I was crying because I didn't want to love him because he was an embarrassment or something.. What a silly man.. 7 years later, happily married.  |-|

When I first got out of college, I became an analyst.  I worked my way to 1st year associate, was pulling in about 275k-300k/year.  

But I was working about 15 hours a day, including weekends.  And pulled MANY all nighters.  Had no time for friends, family, hobbies, nothing.

It wasn't worth it for me.  I had a kickass apartment in NYC, but I was never even home.  I bought awesome shit I never had time to use, and I was tired and felt like shit ALL the time.  Eventually, my personal/social life completely fell apart, I burned out and shut myself in my apartment, depressed for about 2 months.

With out warning, he drove across town, just to make sure I was ok. This was something nobody had ever done for me. So, feels for him got pretty deep.

Fast forward 1 week later. I'm in mexico, I miss him. I'm feeling.. "Lopsided" My favorite band plays this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rzjsbvELqI

And It hits me. I'm in love with this guy. Like... REALLY in love. Holy shit, this is a first. Ok. What do I do? I go home, tell him I love him. 

But here's what I didn't know.

Moving forward another month. We're on vacation in california, I'm meeting his whole family. On the way to our hotel he tells me, "If I had the money, and I had it my way, there'd be a ring on that left hand from me. It would have been there the day we met. One day, I'll get you one. And I'll be able to take care of you."

I cried.

We're at the point now where we can't see ourselves with out the other. We're each others halves. Best friends. I felt lopsided because he wasn't there. I realized, while I was in Mexico, that there wasn't anyone else for me. |-|

The first explorers to get there bring back Earth a small card shaped black object. After many years and billions spent in research, the scientists find out that the black card is actually a very advanced hard drive that contains data about the language, technology and culture of that civilization. The human race rapidly absorbs most of it. We learn how to go further in space travel, and we master the aliens technology. As the decades go by, new data gets extracted from the black card. We learn that the aliens were destroyed by themselves, and that they were very close to stop their own demise, but they were running out of time. As a last hope, they built a space station with all the data and information needed and sent it back in time to a place where they know it would be found. War stars in Earth.

We start building the space station.

|-| cnuq7ha || 22 || We were out for our spring break trip when we were still in college. I had booked a campground in the Outer Banks, and already planned a bunch of stuff to do. I went to the Outer Banks as a kid and never had a chance to go back, and I remember how much fun I had. We get there, manage to set up our tent, and the deluge starts. We went to the camp office and used the Wifi to find out that a hurricane is moving in. It was too late to do anything, so we had to rough it out the first night in the tent.

I awaken to the feeling of the tent being bent completely over and laying on my face. This is one of the half dome shape tents that I had positioned into the wind, so it usually only does that in some SERIOUS wind. I decided that we weren't going to stay. So I start quietly packing everything up except for the tent, since she was still asleep in it. 

Now, I didn't want to waste all the effort packing, and also really wanted to get a sun tan damnit. I woke her at about 0730, and said that we were going to leave. We could either start driving south until we found beach weather, or we would go home and just save the money. She smiled and said lets go to Florida. So we did.

We get there and it's sunny and 80. We get another camp site and a ton of beer and fire wood, and were walking distance from the beach and town. We rode bicycles the entire week and a half, spent all our time on the beach during the day and went out every single night. About 4 days in, we go out for a swim at night. I don't know how, but it seemed like the moon was lighting up the entire world when we were out swimming. I remember clearly seeing her face in the moonlight, and her smiling at me. I looked directly into her eyes, and right there I knew that I was a goner. I knew that I had found the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. We went almost 1000 miles by road just the two of us, and talked the entire time. It was just fun, and it was so easy. There wasn't any need to try and impress each other, to show off, or do something you didn't want to.  |-|

It was in the oven, but I had to go home to work on an article that was due later that night.

I married the shit out of her.  |-| 
|-| cnuqmzk || 39 || My SO and I had a very rocky start, we were both dating other people when we met each other and both had bad breakups before we got together. About a month or two into our "relationship" (we had known each other for about a year at this point but only recently decided to be serious), SO wanted to go on a backpacking trip across the Pacific. We were both broke and had no business travel abroad together given our unstable relationship, but somehow we both decided to jump in feet first and figure it out later.

Our first stop was Hawaii. On the plane ride there, my stomach started gurgling. Talking to me in dangerous tones. Hurting. Like, really hurting. I proceeded to shit my guts out somewhere over the ocean and when we finally landed, I was a sweaty mess of gas and nausea.

Seriously not a good look.

The rest of the time in Hawaii, I was constantly throwing up, padlocked to any toilet I could find, and truly appreciating the meaning of the word "shart". I was, frankly, disgusting. I spent the first night in paradise curled up on the cold bathroom tile, moaning and hating life. The second night, after a very very close call at the beach and several pit stops on the highway back, I was exhausted. My holes had thankfully plugged up for a bit, so I was ready for some sleep.

We had booked a cheap room with two double beds and after we got back from the beach and I showered, I collapsed on one double bed and prepared for a harrowing night. I knew I was going to crap the bed. I knew and I didn't care. Whatever. I had shit myself enough. I was so tired, I just wanted to sleep. 

I didn't care one bit, until SO climbed into bed with me.

I was beyond baffled. I asked him what the fuck he was doing, and he rolled towards me and began rubbing my belly. He told me to go to sleep. I told him to move beds but he seemed to ignore me. I was so embarrassed. I didn't want to tell him to move to the other bed, it was a set fact I was sure to projectile poop all over his PJs and I didn't know how to begin telling him. So I decided to shut my mouth, try my best and pray to every god I could possibly believe in.

I don't need to say that I did indeed shit the bed that night. He slept through it and when I told him the next morning, he shrugged, said it was fine and helped me clean up. He spoke to the front desk and got the sheets changed and then took me to the Dole Plantation for the day.

Pro-life Tip: Never attempt the World's Largest Garden Maze in the midst of intense and unrelenting diarrhea. 

Anyways, we left Hawaii after a week and proceeded to travel to six other countries around the Pacific. We had a lot of fights and spent 24 hours a day together for about six weeks. He got sick in Australia from eating an unpasteurized egg (he threw up all over the bathroom wall, so I somewhat redeemed Hawaii by taking care of him). We were robbed at knife point in Thailand and I almost shoved him over the harbor in New Zealand. We climbed Mt. Fuji in nighttime. I met his family in Taiwan and we watched the sunset in every country we went to.

To this day, I have no idea why he slept in that bed with me. I asked him a couple years ago (we're married now) and he said he doesn't know why, but he just didn't feel right leaving me to myself during the night. He knew I was going to poop myself and probably get some on him, but he just said it felt right to keep me company. 

So yes, my "aha" moment was when my SO told me it was okay to get poop on him. When he climbed into that bed with me and told me it was okay, in my fevered brain I knew I had found the one.

|-| cnurn1x || 6 || I actually auditioned for American Idol last year.  I didn't make it very far, but what I saw surprised me a bit.  Probably more than it should have, thinking back.  It's just funny, since we couldn't find me, even in the crowd shots, and I was wearing a big orange sweatshirt.

The auditions were split into two days, the sign-up, then the singing.  In front of a couple of producers, not the judges, but I'll get to that later.  During sign up day, they waited until the sun came up before having camera people walk through the crowds with a camera, asking people if they had interesting (not singing related) skills, and setting up dancing circles.  Of course, if impromptu singing came up, of course they grabbed that too.

They gave you paperwork, asking things like basic info, normal release forms and stuff, but also asked stuff like 'have any major events happened in your life recently'.

They had everyone get there several hours early.  After 3+ hours, they filtered people into the stadium steps to set up all the crowd shots and everything, doing all of those at once.  Then everyone took a seat, and they explained how they'd do it.

There were 10 tents, each with a pair of producers.  One of the tents was an 'instant pass' tent (I don't think I actually saw anyone go to that, but I wasn't paying a lot of attention), two were for people with instruments, and the rest were a cappella.

Ryan Seacrest walked around and did a few interviews while people waited to be called up.

Four people would go up at a time, hand them the paperwork, sing a few lines, then step back.  They'd say who would go, who wouldn't.  The passing people would go into another room, the losers would go out the gates for the big "walk of shame" shots, the more tears, the more cameras in your face.

The producers wouldn't give advice, they'd just say 'yay' or 'nay'.  They did say during the explanations that they were looking for more than just singing, and that many wouldn't make it through because they have a quota and can't go too far past it.

The thing that got me was that there were so many people that were amazing, and didn't make it because, I guess, they weren't good for TV.  And also the only person from my group who made it was a girl who wore as much clothing as a Barbie doll who had apparently 'sang the day before'.

It could have changed a lot after the first couple rounds, but I never made it, so I wouldn't know.

TLDR: American Idol, while not really giving people lines, lots of set ups and a clear emphasis on being good for ratings.  At least in the auditions. |-|

After we split, I met this girl who awoke in me a greater sense of adventure. We are constantly planning trips, and she loves the outdoors. But what made her perfect was how she acted on our first big vacation.

We decided to drive to Pittsburgh - just a city we both had never been to -and go hiking in Ohiopyle State Park. She was this big ball of positivity. We climbed on the rocks off the trail, took silly photos, joked about life. One of my big regrets is not telling her I loved her for the first time right then and there.  |-|

I replied some artfully-wicked, fruity reply, to which to this day I STILL don't remember, and 120 people erupted in laughter at this Leading-Hand. Like roof off of building laughter. All up in his face, pretty close quarters. He went beet-red.

|-| cnurvnk || 53 || On November 8th, 1995, the signal from the Voyager I probe simply cut out. No warning, no diagnostic readouts, just a steady stream of data and then suddenly... silence. The farthest-ranging spacecraft mankind had ever flung out into the cosmos had vanished, its fate an impenetrable mystery.

Of course, in the weeks following its disappearance, theories abounded as to what tragedy might have befallen the intrepid Voyager I. Perhaps there was a collision with a micrometeorite, or maybe an errant burst of radiation fried the spacecraft's sensitive electronics. Fringe elements even claimed that it had been picked up by some sort of alien craft, and that whale song, and thunder, and the world's many voices now echoed through the hull of some advanced craft patrolling the void beyond the Kuiper Belt.

But after months of intensive data mining, scientists determined that the signal conveying the last known data packets had been ever-so-slightly distorted, as if by some sort of lensing or diffusive effect. Thus, the leading theory was that at the boundary of the known solar system, the Voyager I had entered into a dense cloud of debris - ice and asteroids and other far-flung materials left drifting at the edge of the stellar disk from which the solar system had formed. And so it was proposed that there, in a manner unbefitting for a spacecraft that had drifted serenely through space for eighteen years, the Voyager I probe had been destroyed in a violent impact.

The curiosity of a generation of scientists was piqued - dense debris fields shouldn't theoretically be possible near the solar system's edge - and so timelines were accelerated for the launch of a follow-on ship. Rather than diverging from the trajectory of Voyager I, as the Voyager II had, this ship would recreate the doomed ship's trajectory as faithfully as possible, sending back a continuous stream of high-resolution pictures via high-bandwidth rapid transmission protocols. This ship would be called, New Horizons.

Now, sixteen years and three planetary rendezvous later, the New Horizons probe has drawn near to the intersect point, where Voyager I had met its end nearly two decades before. The probe has been within probable ranges for three months, and so initial enthusiasm for the project has waned, and the program is now operating on a skeleton crew. 

At 3AM, in a darkened control room in Houston, a lone engineer sits in front of a computer monitor, his face illuminated with a fluorescent glow as he watches a progress bar ticking towards completion. 

With a robotic chirp, a window opens automatically on his screen. Just like the previous hundred images he's received, nothing - a field of black punctuated by the occasional star.

Thirty seconds later, another chirp, another image, identical to the last. He had feared that this would be a dead-end job when he'd signed on, but with the economy being what it was and with Maria being pregnant with their first child, he knew they could really use the extra money. And he didn't mind it so much, really - there was something peaceful about sitting alone in the control room, surrounded by the low thrum of hibernating computers, receiving intermittent love letters from a spacecraft billions of miles away.

Chirp. A new window opens - more of the same. Except... he sits forward in his chair, and uses the keyboard shortcuts to toggle between the last two images. There, in the dead center of the second image, a small, dim object has appeared. He rubs his eyes and sits forward, eyes glued to the monitor.

Chirp. Three more objects blink into view, and the first object has grown larger, taking on a definitively irregular shape. The progress bar seems to slow to a crawl as he wills it towards 100%.

Chirp. The view is filled with them now, hundreds of them - strange, angular objects, reflecting a pale blue hue from the dim light of the distant sun. He brings his face within inches of the screen, squinting at the image - the first object is maybe a hundred meters away now, and its form is oddly familiar, like a jagged snowflake lying upon the black backdrop of space. 

The computer gives off a chirp and with a shrill, startled cry, he flings himself away from the monitor. The probe is among them. The screen is filled with a dense field of human bodies, hundreds upon hundreds of them, their faces pale and blank, their eyes staring vacantly off into infinity. Some are spread-eagled, as though cartwheeling through the void, while others lay curled in the fetal position, knees tucked in close to their chests. His breath comes in ragged as he edges closer to the screen, his disbelieving eyes darting from figure to figure. Suddenly, his breath catches in his throat. There, just left of center, eighty meters out. His pulse hammers in his ears as he leans in to examine the figures. No, it's not possible. It can't be. It cannot fucking be. He looks around the empty control room, certain that his co-workers are playing some kind of sick joke on him. The room remains dark and silent, the hum of computer fans the only sound penetrating the silence.

Chirp. With a moan of anguish, he falls to his knees, his fingertips tracing the outline of his wife's face on the monitor. Her brown eyes stare vacantly, mouth frozen in a slight grimace. A tiny, second figure drifts nearby, and with horror he realizes that it is still attached to his wife's body by a thin, frozen umbilical. He retches, and reels away from the computer, his shaky hands fumbling desperately with his cell phone. Hot tears streak down his cheeks as the phone rings, and he runs his hand through his hair with increasing agitation. Finally, after four rings, he hears a sleep-muddled voice on the other end.

"Hello?"

He heaves a sigh of relief. "Maria, are you okay? And the baby? I need you to tell me exactly where you are, right now -"

His wife sighs, and mumbles, "Honey, I'm at home. It's late - can this wait until tomorrow? Honey? Hello?"

Through the phone, she hears a bright, metallic chirp, and the sound of a phone being dropped to the floor. The sobbing starts low, then rises in pitch to take on a manic quality. In the control room, the engineer sits with his back to his desk, his shoulders heaving as his body is wracked with spasms of fear. On the computer screen behind him, the frame is filled with the form of a single figure. There, at the edge of the solar system, some four billion miles away, the frozen body of the lone engineer drifts, its hands contorted into tortured, grasping claws, its legs buckled and twisted, its face stretched into a rigor mortis howl of anguish. 

As the man sobs, a dialog box appears, signifying the termination of the ship's signal. With a final chirp, the computer commits all images to memory and turns itself off, and the room is dark and silent, save for the hum of sleeping computers, and the sound of tormented, convulsive gasping. |-|

|-| cnus15m || 4 || I was a volunteer on Extreme Makeover Home Edition. I guess not normally what you think of for reality TV, but it is. It was actually really easy to volunteer. You just has to show up, sign away your rights, and tada.

The scripted portions with the main designers were pretty much complete bullshit. We were moving bags of concrete and then one of the designers comes over with a camera crew. They want to do a shoot of what we are working on, and they tell all of us just to move bags in the background. To where? They are where they need to be. Ehhh, just around. So we moved the bags around randomly in the background. That scene didn't make it anyways.

Another great moment was when they pull the truck up with the furniture and a bunch of volunteers get to grab the stuff out and take it into the house. They did several shoots and it's just one small truck. So what ended up happening is some of the furniture went into the house, out the back door, back into the truck, next shoot, into the house again. Just extra work to get a good enough shot.

I also got to experience the reveal to the family. After working to get all the finishing touches done (literally, the paint had not yet dried), we went out to the front of the house and the bus was there. It felt like forever standing there, but was maybe 1.5 hours? They had amassed a pretty big crowd. They started by just telling us to cheer and they had cameras recording and flying over the crowd. That happened for a while, on and off. Then we see a limo pulling up and the cheering gets crazy. Some person gets out of the limo and it's just some random person, not the owner of the house. Soooo disappointing. I think they faked out us twice before the real owner came.

The thing that was not fake was a house materializing in a week with real contractors who were extremely real people making it happen. Tons of skilled and unskilled volunteers also making it happen in our silly shirts and hard hats. I came earlier in the week and the last day and it was pretty astounding what progress was made in the middle. There is also an extremely overwhelmed and happy family coming back that day, even though there are horror stories about people losing the homes afterwards. I'm not sure what the outcome was for that family, but even with all the BS, it was pretty fun being a part of it.  |-|

- Our customer support was told to never admit fault, Samsung products cannot break, unless the customer is using the item wrong.
- We got about 50 emails from one of our outsourced technical support centers about how poorly the employees were being treated. We were instructed to do nothing. This included sexual harassment and abuse of power.
- If you ever send your phone or samsung product to be repaired, we will do absolutely everything to make sure it does not go under the warranty. We will pick the phone apart, and search every inch of it for scratches or dents. 

- The reason repairs without warranty are so expensive is because we do not repair your phone/stuff, we replace it with a new one, probably used before.

Basically anything regarding money were an issue. I know about one person who got a raise there, and he had worked there for about six years prior to that. 

I will not and can not recommend anyone to buy Samsung products. Not just because the products are overpriced, but also because of how they treat their employees. There are other companies out there who actually cares for their customers.

Edit: Oh, and to get to the truly evil point - rather than improving the overall happiness of their emplyees at the factories, they installed safetynets around some of the buildings in order to prevent suicide. A few factory workers have had to quit because of depression as well. |-|

Our station was on the show Border War (it's been a few times but they haven't been back in about 2 years) and everything out in the brush was real. Kinda hard to get a smuggler and his group of 15 to perform right on cue, but some of the stuff at the checkpoint was re-enacted for the cameras. 

We had a case where there a was a couple hundred pounds of dope hidden in a false wall that we found with the X-ray truck. For whatever reason the film crew wasn't there (I think they were out in the brush at the time) and when they got to the checkpoint they re-enacted the initial contact with another unrelated truck and filmed when they rescanned the truck. Through the magic of editing it all looks like the same case. 

A few of my buddies down at one of the line stations (on the river) told me some agents busted up a group of drug mules but they dropped the bundles and absconded back into Mexico. The film crew turned up a few minutes later (they heard the traffic on the radio) and asked if the agents could put the bundles back into the brush, then re-enact jumping the group only to find the bundles of dope. 


Other than those two instances the film crew members I met were surprisingly eager to go out and catch as much real footage as they could get.  |-|

I went to an out of state college our first year. When my best friend came to visit me, he enlisted her to bring me two Tupperware containers full of chocolate covered pretzels because he knew they were my favorite. But I knew he was the one when he made a third batch for my friend because he knew she would sneak some on the drive there.  

A few weeks ago at rush hour about eight two-by-fours fell out of some random guys truck. My response was how are you going to drive around that. He jumped out of the car and helped the guy load his truck back up. Once he got back in the car he said "those fuckers are heavy" and then drove off without another thought. 

It's been three years and I continually find new things that make me realize he's the one.  |-| 
|-| cnusi0m || 90 || We hung out a few times, hooked up... And then he was a total jerk. Didn't speak to me at all. I'm not interested in chasing, so I mostly forgot about him. 

Then, in a scene reminiscent of "Knocked Up", I found out I was pregnant. He was largely accepting, even excited about the fact that we were pregnant with twins, and spent nearly every night taking care of me (I went through hypermedia and had many other complications). 

Eventually, we decided to try and make things work for the sake of the pregnancy (because we were both dummies). So we started attempting a relationship. Even though we were working at it, we had relatively little in common other than some chemistry. That was a tough few months. 

Eventually, I miscarried one child due to my shitty, soul-sucking uterus, and we soldiered on. That somehow seemed to break the barrier between "we're both good people, but  doing this for the kid" to "I can see why you're a great partner". We started spending more time laughing and doing date-related things. More like a real relationship. 

We miscarried the other twin about a month later. He spent days taking care of me and consoling me. I was a complete mess. After the dust settled, I had a very clear conversation with him, in which I explained we had done this for the children, and now there were no children. There was no reason to continue the song and dance of attempting to force a romantic relationship with someone who was no longer going to co-parent. I wanted to make it clear that he was still a great friend, but I wasn't interested in remaining together for guilt. We were good to go our separate ways. 

His response? "Nonsense." And he kissed me. After months of my highest highs and my lowest lows, the vomit, the tears, the blood, the agony of knowing my body was conspiring against my unborn children, and seeing me in my moments of absolute defeat, he wasn't going anywhere. I knew in that moment that I loved him, which wasn't something I'd realized at all, and I wanted to spend the rest my life with him. I wanted to be his. 

6 years, 4 failed pregnancies, and 1 healthy child later, we're married and adore our little family. He stuck it out for both of us. We've been through a ton, but he's my rock. We've been on the same page since before we knew we were. I could never ask for anything more!

Companies who have direct monetary interests that push them towards immoral acts are the ones who are genuinely evil.

For profit prisons have a direct monetary interest in more convictions, and as little rehabilitation as possible. The stupidity of creating an industry that has a vested interest in the prison population being as large as possible, for as long as possible, is staggering. They've even been caught bribing judges into trying juveniles as adults and passing long sentences.

Oil companies have a vested interest in preventing electric cars and solar power from challenging them.

Car companies have a vested interest in keeping public transport poor, their wholesale destruction of the rail-car system in the US in the 20th century is a good example.

Companies need their products sold, they don't care if something else is better for their consumers or the environment, because if their products don't sell, they go out of business.

For most products that's benign or neutral, so long as we don't treat them as an authority on what policy should be.

But when the product is 'prison space', we really start running into problems.

edit: I want to add that the companies who don't have to deal with the people who are hurt by their business practices and decisions, are the ones who slide into immorality most easily. Whether that's because they have a monopoly, or because the person they sell their service to (say, city or government) isn't the person who they then deal with, it is very easy for them to forget any semblance of morality. |-|

I didn't hear from him for 12 hours. The thought of never hearing his voice again made me realize I couldn't live without him. I panicked and called 15 different hospitals looking for him.

He wound up being okay. It was a severe asthma attack while driving. No hospital I called in a 30 mile radius of that town would release any info because I wasn't a family member. Happy to say that I'll officially be his wife later this year. He drives me insane sometimes, but he's worth it. |-|

1. My dad used to live above Ryan aka "Daddy" from Party Down South and was really good friends with him. I've met Ryan multiple times, my dad has pictures of them from all the times they hung out before my dad moved back to Oklahoma. Most of what they do on the show is unscripted and it's just them being drunk rednecks. My dad was on their Christmas special in 2014 for like 2 seconds. They filmed the Christmas special the week before Halloween. 

2. Friend of my family went on The Price Is Right and won the Showcase Showdown. Got a trip around the world and some other things. I only remember the trip because he got me a hat from Italy and I was pretty young. 

I know more about the Party Down South stuff than I do the Price Is Right stuff. Any question feel free to ask and I'll answer the best I can.

I was also on IGN's Lollipop Chainsaw competition to be the "Real Life Juliet Starling". Came in fourth place. Again, mostly real, but the editing room seemed to like choosing clips of us flubbing our lines when doing the acting portion of the audition which was a bummer because these videos were supposed to help the audience decide who to vote for. It was incredibly fun though, and I got to meet Greg Miller who is so awesome and friendly IRL. Great experience overall and I learned a lot from it! |-|

|-| cnuta8c || 3 || &gt;There wasn't really a "moment". Just a gradual realization that we don't feel whole unless we're together.

/r/Satans__Secretary, that was our experience too. I did have an 'aha' moment when I realized he was in it to win it, though. It was less than a month after we had been dating, and we were both being exclusive but it was just understood. We skipped the awkward "What are we?" conversation. He just referred to me as his girlfriend in a story he was telling about a conversation with a co-worker, and I didn't argue. Shortly after this my dad died unexpectedly. My now-husband has social anxiety, and while he handles it well (most people would never guess that it's a thing for him) he also does his best to avoid situations that he knows will be uncomfortable…like meeting my whole family for the first time at my dad's funeral. He did it, though. He asked me where I wanted him to be and when. I didn't ask him to come to the wake because he was scheduled to work, I knew I wouldn't be able to stay with him because everyone would be up in my business all night and because that is the most awkward situation I can imagine for myself, even without social anxiety. But we were together constantly outside of that, and it was so nice to feel normal when everything was so wrong everywhere else. He met my mom for the first time at the church before the funeral started, he sat with my friends behind me at the service since he hadn't met the rest of my relatives yet, and then he met most of them at lunch afterwards. I can't imagine how hard that experience would've been without him there. May will be 4 years since my dad died, and it still sucks. I hate that he never met my husband, especially since he could have. We were talking about what we should do with my parents since he had just introduced me to his. But he endured hours of what he hates the most because he knew it would make things easier for me, and he does that constantly to this day. He really is a keeper. |-|

|-| cnutis3 || 353 || I lot of strange stuff has happened in my cab. It's really hard to point to one thing because they were all strange for different reasons.

Christmas day 2013 I had a gentleman try and convince me the reason we got snow was because seagulls brought it in from the coast. He was ridiculously wealthy too. Let me be clear, this wasn't stupid rich guy a la Zoolander talk. He talked just like the crazies in downtown except he had a wife and kids, a really nice house, and had showered that morning.

Technically didn't happen in my cab, but just outside of it. Had these two girls who had "payment issues" because their debit card wasn't working. Went through several options that were all bad ("No I won't wait 45 minutes so your Dad can come across town to pay me."). Finally the girls exchanged a look, and one got this really sad look on her face, and the other offered to let her girlfriend give me a blowjob. We eventually got settled when one of their friends bailed them out. It's more heartbreaking than weird, especially because I don't think that was the first time something like that went down for them.

Oh and on a happier note: I had the two bro-iest bro's that ever bro'ed get in my cab. They were attending the local college and had been friends since like childhood and it was one of their birthdays (they drunkenly reminded me of this repeatedly). Part way home they start horsing around. Wrestling and whatnot. They are just getting to the point where I'm about to tell them to knock it off when it just stops. Then a lot of loud drunken whispering happens. From what I could piece together one kissed the other and that's how they both found out they were gay. They could have been fucking with me, but they left with their arms on each others shoulders. It's nice to think I got to see two guys come to terms with who they were and find a little happiness in the process. |-| 
|-| cnutisd || 5 || *Chinese fuckers pharmaceutical inc.* is the worst company in the world, making over $75 million dollars a year by selling counterfeits of life-saving medicines in Sub-Saharan Africa, and nearly killing me too.

Let me explain. Malaria is one of the deadliest diseases in history. It has been haunting humans for 100,000 years, but it wasn't until our development of agriculture and dense settlements that it became the plague it is today. It has even been suggested that malaria could be the leading cumulative cause of human death in history. Despite massive improvements in repellents, insecticides, draining of standing water and bed net campaigns, it still [infects over 200 million people per year and kills around 700,000, mostly children under 15, mostly poor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria#Epidemiology). On top of this it causes billions of dollars of damages through lost wages and medical costs in the poorest parts of the planet.

Last year I was infected. I fell suddenly very ill one night and became quickly bedridden; due to being in a remote part of central Gambia, and too sick to travel, I sent a friend to go to the nearest town to get medicine. He returned the next day and I took the ACT (artemisinin combined therapy) he brought, the preferred treatment in West Africa these days. This shit is the bomb, about 95% cure rate. Fast forward 3 days later; I had finished my course of ACT and still felt horrible; out-of-control fever, full body joint aches, teeth-rattling chills. Luckily I had another pack; better hammer this back and finish these *Plasmodium* bitches for good. I completed my second round and was still sick. At this point I was in very serious condition. I couldn't control the fever any more and felt like I was on the edge of losing control and going off into fever hallucination land.

Nearly too sick to travel, I somehow got onto a motorcycle for a long and grueling journey, during which I was at times barely able to stay conscious. Arriving in Farafenni I was plopped onto a horse cart which navigated to the nearest hospital. I was dragged through the door like a limp rag, they hit me hard with another brand of ACT and fever &amp; rehydration and within a few days the fever broke and I started healing.

That was how I discovered that between [30](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria#Counterfeit_and_substandard_drugs) and [50%](http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/88/4/10-020410/en/) of all antimalarials in Africa are counterfeit], manufactured by *Chinese fuckers inc.* These guys are making billions from the miserable, agonizing deaths of tens of thousands; [nobody even really knows how many they kill every year](http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/88/4/10-020410/en/). It's probably the worst exploitation I have ever seen. Imagine, these are the poorest people on the entire earth, ill with a deadly disease, scraping together the few dollars they have in exchange for a shot at survival. They make the harrowing journey to get to a pharmacy, and buy some pills to rescue their son or daughter. And they get fake fucking chalk pills medicine, and watch their kids die of malaria or breakbone fever.

But why blame *Chinese fuckers inc.* you say? Well, investigative work on the part of WHO, medical researchers and journalists have uncovered that the [vast majority of these fake drugs are coming from Southern China](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/23/malaria-fake-medicines-africa-china?intcmp=239). This was not easy to discover; *Chinese fuckers inc.* do an incredible job of hiding their trail, including fake shipping companies, false distributors, highjacking the addresses of legitimate storefronts, etc. 

However a clever forensic study examined the air trapped around pills in the blister packs of intercepted fakes and detected a few stray pollen grains. [By analyzing the types of pollen found](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050032) they were able to figure out what combination of plants were in the area and identified that the pills were packed in the People's Republic of China's Southern border area. Counterfeits are being shipped predominantly out of [Guanghzou](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324474004578444942841728204), bound for African and Asian markets.

We are talking perfect frauds here; national health authority stamps, official holograms, sealed blister packs... *Chinese fuckers inc.* are sometimes even spraying fake pills with a light solution of the real drug, enough so that it will test positive if someone checks for the medicinal ingredient, but not enough to actually cure you.  Instead it will not kill the parasite and contribute to the growing development of drug-resistant strains. Think about what a cynical son of a bitch it takes to do that.

Similarities in many of the packaging and drugs found pointed to a common source of origin for quite a few of the common counterfeits. It seems that there are a couple of companies who must have enormous factories devoted uniquely to churning out death pills 24/7... friends and neighbours, let me introduce you to *Chinese fuckers inc.*

International efforts have led to a few high-profile seizures, including an [INTERPOL effort in China that turned up *20 million pills*](http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/88/4/10-020410/en/), but these targeted mostly retail outlets; the large-scale Chinese counterfeit factories have somehow managed to mostly elude detection or to restart quickly. 

So although I do not know exactly where or who they are, *Chinese fuckers pharmaceutical inc.* is the worst company in the world. |-|

|-| cnuu02c || 65 || I drove for lyft for a little bit. I have 2 stories, which happened within 3 first days of my driving for them. So I picked up these 3 people to take them to a concert. One girl and two guys, all hipster. We are just talking, having  a good time. They were actually very nice to me, and out of no where of them says to another,  "shut up, and eat your mushrooms ". At that point, I'm sweating bullets. My windows aren't tinted, I didn't feel like being pulled over and arrested for possesion and transport of illicit drugs. Luckily, they were respectful, they put away the shrooms. I dropped them off and they tipped me a few bucks. 

This other incident was far worse. I get a request down the street from my house. I pick 4 individuals, 3 dudes and a girl. I knew something was wrong when I had to pick them up separately within few yards from the original location , also the fact that all the dudes were dressed like Jesse Pinkman. White boys with bad tattoos, baggie pants, horrible teeth,  jerseys and tank tops. Yep,  they were methheads A
alright. The girl looked the worst, she was extremely skinny with huge bags under her eyes and rotten black teeth. All 4 of them had duffel bags (filled with who the fuck knows what) on them and held to them for their dear life. So they ask me to drop them off at Walmart. I'm driving to Walmart to a neighboring sketchy town over known for tweekers. I'm sweating fucking bullets scared my godamn life. They keep talking to someone on their phones on how they're going to Walmart to do the "thing". So I get to Walmart and they ask me to stay and wait for them for 20 minutes while the meter is running. The dudes leave with their duffle bags,  and the tweeker lady stays. She's barely there, passing out in my back seat. I told her that I have to go and I can't wait for them any longer. After a little hesitation, she left and I drove like hell. After that incident, I never drove my car for lyft again .  |-|

It gives off no smell and it doesn't look like it was meant to be sold that way, it just looks so awesome on this guy.  

Now over the years me and George have got pretty close, we chat I ask him about the wife and kids he asks me how my life is going and generally have a good time laughing and joking all the way home. On more than a few occasions we have had a sing along back to my place where I pay and tip and wave as he goes on his merry way back into town. But I'm like Gollum for that hat, I will barter beg and plead with him to give it up to me. Doesn't happen though he outright refuses to allow it off his head. I've offered to buy him a new hat, to pay twice the going rate for the hat when it was new. I've told him I'll do menial tasks he would rather not do in exchange for the chance to wear his hat. Nothing. I can only presume it has some spiritual or otherwise personal meaning to him that he hasn't let slip.

|-| cnuuzb6 || 4 || We had been living together for a couple of years. I got food poisoning. I'm sitting on the toilet being violently ill out my back end. I'm coated in a sheen of sweat and I start to get really dizzy. I'm genuinely afraid of passing out and shitting all over myself and the bathroom, so I call out to him for help. He comes in, sits on the floor in front of me and strokes my legs to comfort me. Waves of intense nausea hit me; I'm going to throw up. He empties out the plastic trash bin for me to use as a bucket. Now I'm being violently ill out both ends. He's stroking my back for comfort. Finally, I think it's passed and he helps me to bed and goes to clean out the bucket. 

It was the most intensely disgusting I had ever been in my life up to that point and not only did he sit with me through it all but he cleaned up after me and not once did he indicate how gross it was or how much he did not want to be there. He was sweet and made me feel complete unjudged and safe. Now that is a fucking keeper.

We are coming up on 10 years together, 5 married, and our son is 6 months old next week. I could not be happier in my life and all the goodness in it is because he has always supported me, nurtured me, made me feel safe, and stuck by me through the bad and the good. I am the best version of myself, being with him. |-|

I've had cops point guns at me, dodged oncoming cars that were escaping police, deliver prostitutes to hotels/brothels and just chat with them about their clients. 

I think the craziest thing was after getting run out on by a clearly distraught woman, I called the police. when they called me back hours later, over the police intercom, the dispatcher asked for the police officer to respond to a suicide at the address I dropped the woman off at. we both were silent on the phone and I said to the officer "well that's messed up" "yep, well I'm headed over there now"  |-|

|-| cnuvfhp || 3 || A giant sphere completely surrounding the solar system, which is made of a strange material that can emanate light.  The light it's emanating is basically to fake all our astronomical observations -- all the stars and galaxies and all the crap we think we see out there in space is just due to this giant LCD-display that surrounds our entire solar system.  

It's all been set up to fool us, basically, so that even the way we derive distances using parallax was totally fake and this giant LCD-sphere would just update the screen to take into account our precise location in orbit.. to completely create the illusion that we're staring out into endless 3D space filled with stars and galaxies all at various distances from us.. but really we aren't.

When we try to penetrate this screen, we find it's made out of a completely indestructible material, and cannot even be dented by atomic weapons.

So basically our entire solar system is one big Truman Show.  And all our observations about astronomy could be fake, for all we know.  All for the amusement of some sick yet advanced alien civilization.

That would be fucking scary.  And weird.

|-| cnuvjvs || 29 || My uncle's the cab driver, not me, but he's got this story he likes to tell of the "flasher twins." Basically there's this street in the downtown of a pretty large, well-known midwestern city. On this street there's an apartment building, and about 8-9 floors up is a window that's always open during the nighttime hours. Most of the time, in this window, are two relatively attractive gals that just don't like wearin' shirts God bless 'em.

One night my uncle picked up two girls, and after getting the address, he realized it was right by that building. He asked, "Hey, do you happen to know who those girls are that stand in the window and flash people?" Yep, no surprise here. He got a little show in the backseat. Not sure what kind of fare he charged them... |-|

|-| cnuvksq || 120 || I picked up 11 people once in a maxi taxi ( Australia ), to take them into town to see a DJ. 2 girls and nine guys. 10 in the back and one guy in the front with me. All were completely fucked up already. 

It was an hour drive to the venue with the stops they needed to make along the way, during which they were discussing whether or not they should shelf their pills ( shove their ecstasy up their arseholes ). 

Once it was established that they should shelf them about a half hour before we arrived, they guys started debating/arguing over which lucky fellows would get to finger the pills up the girls arses. I was confused. 

It seems that when these young people were talking about shelving, it was a given that they would be shoving the pills up each others arses, not up their own. So there we were, driving along the highway with 2 girls fingering pills up the arsehols of these lucky gents. 

I had to pull over so the guy in the front could trade places with one of the guys in the back who already had his pill shoved up his arse, so that he could have his turn. Once the guys were done it was the girls turn. 

The amazing thing to me was that these were really nice people. Friendly, well spoken, seemingly intelligent. Not the trashy, feral, bogan scum that I would expect that kind of behaviour from ( even though that was one of the trashiest things I'd ever witnessed ). 

P.S. I keep hand sanitizer in my work bag. I insisted they use it and keep the bottle.

TLDR; 11 people shoved ecstasy up each others arseholes on the way to a club.

|-| cnuvobs || 17 || I drove a taxi during college on the weekends. The company I drove for was near a town that was mostly Hasidic Jews. They had a system through our cab company called "Shalom Travel", where on their sabbath we would pick them up and drop them off and they wouldn't pay because they weren't aloud to handle money on that day (they would pre pay each month). Needless to say no driver wanted those rides because you got no tip. As the new guy I ended up with all the Shalom Travels. Now not to be stereotypical, but Hasidic Jews have LOTS of kids. On more than 1 occasion I had to drive a man and his wife (who was going into labor) to a special hospital 45 minutes north of their town so she could give birth. Also had to help her to the car, carry their bags, and wheel her into the hospital because they are not aloud to do any work on that day.... |-|

Was picked up by a taxi on Oxford street. He pulled over and wanted me to get in.  I was insistent I didn't need a cab but I was running for the last tube to get to where I was living (told him the area) and he promised to drop me off at the tube station, wouldn't charge me, was just helping someone out. He didn't, he locked the doors and drive towards my flat, pulling up at the park which was fortunately next to my block. He unlocked the door to get into the back to talk to me , said he was an artist and would like me to pose for him, naked but not graphic poses. He said he'd demonstrate and unlocked the back doors to get i and show me. I ran, luckily made a clean getaway.

I was friends with my SO for a long time before we started dating. He's always been super easy to talk to and interested in what I had to say about my family etc. Often he'd ask me to tell a story about my family; my mother has 6 brothers and sisters, my dad has 5, and most people would be kind of overwhelmed by that number of people and unable to keep track, but I noticed fairly early on that he remembered all the details of the stories.

One that I told him, waaay back when we were just hanging out as buddies, was about my mum's good friend at the time. She was really covetous of this china cabinet my mum had, and my mother really only had it as her brother (my uncle) had inherited it from their grandmother but had nowhere to keep it. (I know, I can hardly keep track either.) When my mum's good friend then ended up marrying my uncle, one of the first things she did after they were engaged was ask to have the cabinet in their new home.

Obviously she was entitled to it, it was his, after all; but my mother LOVED that cabinet and as a 12 year old I was really angry with her for taking it so soon and without even being nice about it.

YEARS later, literally about five years later, my parents and SO and I were all sitting around, and for some reason were talking about how my uncle used to have a huge collection of LOtR memorabilia and mythological stuff that he's not allowed to have out now because they clash with the decor. Generally just making a bit of fun about my bossy aunt (even though we love her! I promise!) and my SO comes out with, "ahhhh, but if only he had a really nice CABINET to display them in!"

I laughed and laughed, but I realised then, that he knows all the details of my stories, even the boring ones. He really listens and really hears what I say, and then he's clever enough and funny enough to make jokes with the content of even the most tedious anecdotes.

So while 'aha' moments may not really be real, that is definitely a moment where I remember thinking, "yes, he does love me, and I love him LIKE A MILLION." |-|

Now, I'm Jewish, and while I have no problem with anyone deciding to believe in Jesus, I do object that these particular people do so and yet continue to call themselves Jews, because they're not.

So I was there one day, and I had to walk past one of the guys handing out flyers, and sure enough, he gets in my face, tries to put a flyer in my hands, and says "Jesus loves you!"

Normally I'd've just kept walking, ignoring him. But that day something told me not to. Instead, I put out my hands in the classic, stereotypical "Jewish person complaining about something" manner and said in my best Jewish-grandma tone:

"But he doesn't call, he doesn't write! How am I supposed to know he loves me?"

After which I walked past the now confused, open-mouthed proselytizer.

|-| cnuwx8k || 4 || my very first morning driving a cab in daytona beach i picked up a guy at 5:15 AM. he was about 55 years old and got in the back and laid on the floor. he had a budweiser 12 pack o'cans and opened one as soon as he got in. my dispatcher had already told me that i was taking him to his doctor about 30 minutes away, that he was a vietnam vet, a regular cab customer, and that he was in pain and would be drinking.

i had never driven a cab before. so, he gets in, opens a beer and kills it. he's moaning the whole time. a couple times i asked him if he was alright but he was never able to answer with words, just groans and moans. luckily he told the dispatcher where he needed to go, and the dispatcher was able to tell me over the radio.

It's good pay for only needing a high school degree, and when you're done you have experience you can use for your next career.  The post 9/11 GI Bill will also pay 100% of your tuition if you go back to school AND give you an actual paycheck to just be a full time student.

I'm not a recruiter and there are plenty of reasons I didn't make the military my life-long career.  But everything I have today...including my two degrees without any school loans and my career making $78k per year...are all directly due to the fact that I joined the military. |-|

Step-brother (to my sister):  I guess we're all old enough for this story now.  So, remember how you would call me to see if our parents were awake yet?

Sister:  We are NOT old enough for that story!

That's where it ended, but I assume my sister was sneaking out at night and calling my step-brother in the morning to see if it was safe to sneak back in...and despite being in her late twenties now, still doesn't want my parents to know about it.

EDIT: Since so many people are telling me why I'm wrong, feel free to PM me if you want to know the mechanics of it.

EDIT 2: Since so many people are PM'ing me, here are the mechanics of it:

Amazon. That's where you have to go. 

What you need:

Computer, net access, fundamental writing skills.

What you do:

1. Decide whether you want to make money or be a "Writer". I know that may sound obvious, but I work with people all the time who are more interested in creating art than in making money. If you want to create art, that's cool, go for it and good luck. But if you want to make money, you need to work within the system.

2. Go to Amazon and see what's selling. There are hundreds of categories -- go through them and see what is selling well that you have interest in. In a perfect world, you shouldn't care, but realistically, it matters for your motivation. A book that's selling reasonably well will be in the top 10k. 

3. Look for a wrinkle that's under-represented in that category. So, for example, let's say you like books about kids having adventures. What kind of adventures are selling? What can you do to mix it up and make it fun? Can you change the protagonist to be a different race, live in a new area, or something else?

4. Follow a common plot structure. There are a million books and blogs about this. Start with the car chase, and by that I mean you want to begin as far into the story as possible. Initial exposition is tedious.

5. Take your story and ask your friends and family to look at it. Post it to /r/selfpublish , /r/writing, ask for advice, etc.

6. Take their feedback. Can't stress this enough. If someone says your book sucks, ask them why, ask for constructive feedback.

7. Go over it a few times, make sure it's tight. 

8. Title it provocatively. Make it clear what the book is about. 

9. Get your cover and use familiar colors and themes. If you're writing a detective story, don't be vague and metaphorical -- make it instantly clear what you're selling.

10. Write your description the way other books that are selling have written theirs. Keep it tight, short, and to the point. Give them enough information to know what the book is about, but not so much that all is revealed. Write in a hook to get them to want to read it.

11. Set up your Amazon account, including author page, etc. Keep it light and fun.

12. Upload your book in both print and digital forms. There are plenty of books out there on how to do it. Choose two categories based on how books that are selling are listed.

13. Price your new story at .99 and put it in the Kindle Select program. Do it on a Thursday.

14. Get your friends and family to buy and review the book. At a buck, fuck 'em if they won't help you. If you don't have friends or family, come to Reddit and ask for help.

15. Write a sequel and link the sequel in the back of the 1st book. Use an affiliate link. People love series, so you'll want to write as many books with the same character as possible to gain a following.

16. Build collections that have multiple stories in them.

17. Profit.

That's the short-short version, but you get the idea. If you don't want to write a plot-based story, write a joke book, or a picture book, or any of a million alternatives. The thing is that the longer you wait, the longer you'll take to get traction.

Hope this helps.

EDIT #2: The Story!

It all started when we were in our mid teens and would carry on every summer for the next few years.

My mom, dad and I were the only part of the family who lived in Alberta, the rest of them were in BC. So every summer we'd pack up and head west for vacation. Sometimes it would be camping, other times we'd stay in a hotel, but we always made sure to visit the extended family. 

One year, when I was around 15, we ended up staying for a couple weeks on Vancouver island, which is where most of my dads family lives. My aunt and uncle, my dads brother and his wife, had a huge house and offered to put us up for however long we needed. Ended up being a little over a week. They had a pool and everything, it was awesome.

His daughter, my cousin (we'll call her C) and I always got along well, despite living one province away and not seeing each other often. It was her room I ended up staying in. In addition to her bed there was also a hide-a-bed couch, which is where I would sleep. 

I always thought she was pretty. She was nice to look at, and she was a little over a year older than me.

Our second day there we all ended up in their pool. And although nothing happened in there, she did rub up against me a few times. Which to a younger guy was just totally awesome.

Most nights the adults would hang out in the back yard drinking and catching up, or they would go out for the evening. 

One night, after the parents had left, we watched movies in her room. We didn't pay much attention to what was on tv, we talked instead. We talked about my life back home, her life, how school went the previous year, that kind of thing. She also asked me if I had a girlfriend back home. I said I did (I didn't). She also asked if my fake girlfriend and I had done stuff. Don't remember what I said, but it was probably yes. 

We were sitting on her bed watching the movie, and she laid her head on my shoulder. I didn't realize she had fallen asleep until I had to wake her to let her know the movie was done. I think I may have fallen asleep a little as well.

She turned to me as she shut off the tv and looked me in the eyes. So I kissed her. We made out a little, but just kissing and awkward teenage groping. Nothing happened that night.

The next few nights, the same thing happened. Parents would go out, we'd watch a movie, or listen to music, on her bed, and things would progress a little further.

During one of our sessions my hand slipped down her pants. She must have liked it because it wasn't long until the clothes were off. We had sex that night. It was my first time.

My parents and I stayed with them for a bit, and things would happen most nights. Unless someone else was in the house, as her door had no locks. 

After a week and a bit we left to go visit my mothers family. Nothing exciting happened during that part though.

Next year was a little different. My aunt, uncle, and cousin, and my mom and dad and I, we all rented out cabins. Each family had their own, but my cousin and I still found ways to be alone.

The 3rd summer, which ended up being the last time we were all together like that, was back at their house. They put us up for 2 weeks, and I had to stay in her room again. 

Things were different that time. We both had grown up, she was already out of high-school, I was in my last year, and we were different people by then. We still did stuff though, we were both more experienced and wanted to show what we knew. 

The next year my grandma (dad and uncles mom) died so the only vacation my dad could afford to take was for the funeral. 

I hardly saw her as she had moved out, and only came around for a couple dinners at her parents place. Nothing happened that trip, as it was kind of a depressing time.

The following years life got in the way. Work, school, we both ended up getting married (to different people of course) and had families of our own. 

She found me on Facebook when I was 26, and by that time I hadn't seen her for almost 7 years. We chatted for a bit, nothing sexual, just 2 people catching up. She deleted her Facebook profile a year later and I haven't talked to her since. I'm 34 now.

I'm sure at the time we both knew what we were doing was wrong, but sometimes teenage hormones just get in the way. 

I miss her, but it wasn't like we were in love or anything. It was just something we did when we were together. It never went past PIV sex and oral though. And she was adopted, so we weren't blood related, so I guess it wasn't that bad.

Our parents would flip out if they found out though.

The power company was on the scene within an hour beginning repairs, but it was a hell of a way to wake up and sent my adrenalin through the roof.

|-| cnuz7w5 || 179 || So one night, when I was in high school, I woke up hearing someone sobbing in the room next to mine. Only my mom and I lived in the house at the time. My mom's room was across the hall but not next to mine. My grandma used to sleep in the room next to mine and she had just left (to return to her life in China). So I thought maybe my mom was missing her and sobbing in her room.

Next morning when I got up and was eating breakfast, my mom turned to me and asked, "Why were you sobbing last night?" That freaked the crap out of me.

EDIT: I guess It didn't make it clear but it sounded like a woman crying. Not particularly like my mom but then again I've never heard her sob like that. |-|

I went down stairs to drive to the store, got in my car, and some weird force kind of "made" me turn the wrong way, which stressed me out. All of a sudden there were cars in front of me swerving and crashing into each other. I tried to stop but the road was iced over and I ended up spinning, and spinning and spinning for a really long time. I blacked out without ever feeling a crash. Woke up in the hospital, covered in real pain. It was agonizing, and I really felt it, unlike any normal dream. I was then walking home with bandaged wounds all over, just defeated, and layed down with my girlfriend. Next thing I know, I woke up, but it was like and active shock that I had been dreaming the whole time.

I actually started to cry when I got up. My car wasn't destroyed, I was healed. I feel like I have a second chance or something. Very strange way to start the day. |-|

I asked them where they had all gone and with the most serious expression ever, they all told me they had been here for a while.

When i was younger we lived in a house that was close to a sharp turn. We had cars in our ditch a lot during icy roads. So my mom woke me up around 4:00 am. to say there was a car on our lawn. I didn't give it much thought but decided to go take a look anyway. Sure enough a car full on its side broke  through neighbors ornaments and drug on our lawn. So i ran outside to see if everyone was ok. They were teenagers (2 girls 1 guy), not drunk or stoned but clearly shook up. They were all fine. I stuck around with them outside to calm them all down. The police came asked them/me a few questions, a tow truck eventually comes, all the kids get picked up and leave. The police look in the car and turn to me and say "How many GPS's" does a car need? i'm confused until he pulls out like what had to be 15-20 GPS's. So cop assumes they were going around stealing GPS's. Not scary just an interesting thing to wake up to. |-|

He thought he'd walked in on me post-sex with my gf at the time, but we'd actually just been play fighting, and the moment he walked in was the moment she decided to put the strap for her top back on her shoulder. After that I find out my dads told half of my family about this, and despite me trying to tell him I hadn't done anything, he claimed to have believed me, but didn't. 

So he'll never know when I actually did, because he believes a lie

The job I left, I got a good offer to bugger off, so I did as I hated the job and was headed towards depression. Started off being not telling them so I can have 3 months off, so I could relax and get into a good headspace for when I was ready to apply for things. My parents can get incredibly naggy, so I didn't want my mum trying to contact me once a day/every other day asking how the jobhunt that I wasn't doing. Last jobhunt before that, I decided to wait 2 weeks before getting into it, and she was asking me nearly every day during that two weeks, despite explaining my plans. 

With the break and the fact my last two jobs were short-lived (6 months and 8 months apiece) it took me awhile to get another. With it taking so long, I was glad I didn't tell them... went through enough rough patches, without having a bunch of insensitive comments being thrown at me.  |-|

|-| cnuzx0h || 803 || Retail.  Everyone should have a retail job once in their life, for at least 6 months.  You need no experience but you will learn a lot from it.  

First, you will probably learn what your ambition is.  If you think folding clothes at the Gap and nothing else is not all that bad of a way to spend a year, college might not be your future path.  If you're racing out of work to try and get in some classes, you will learn how to time manage like a pro.  

Secondly, you will learn social skills.  The ability, or perhaps art of looking someone in the eye and have a conversation is something you need to practice.  Without the glow of a phone nearby.  It is possible.

Third, you will learn that people, all people, are disgusting.  Why is this important?  Because once you realize that other people are human, you think before acting, and act a little nicer.  Psychological fact. 

Fourth, most importantly, you will be a better shopper.  If you've had to fold shirts for an hour, or serve people food for hours, or clean bathrooms, you will always remember that when you are on the other end.  Sure, some of you will feel vengeance and be "well, I cleaned this, so can they!" but the vast majority will remember how much they hated when people acted up and avoid that same behavior.   The old golden rule in effect.   |-|

I didn't think Facebook would last... but it's still there.

Next, it was Twitter. Who would want to waste their time with 140-character messages? There was no way, I thought, that it would catch on, much less stuck around.

After that, it was InstaGram, then Vine, then... look, are you sensing a theme here?

I'll definitely be investing in the *next* stupid social media site, because apparently anything that *I* think is doomed is destined for greatness.

|-| cnv01el || 26 || Only real secret I have from them is what happened to me at a christmas party when I was 15, which was; A large group of teens ranging from 14 to 19 drove in the canopy of a ute to pick up some others in the country side when a girl went through my 18 year old brothers wallet. My brother was, and still is, an aggressive douchebag and pretty much beat the shit out of me, since he couldn't hit her(good on him for that at least) in front of heaps of family friends, like really badly. We drove back to the adults and no one was talking or smiling like they were when we left and i sat in the car for the next 4 hours in too much pain to get out and I heard everyone was pretty shaken and just didn't really speak or socialize the rest of the somber night.


He has been in the Army for the last 9 years and is slightly less of a douchebag now but still somewhat. Wouldn't want to piss him off.


I told my parents pretty much everything growing up, mostly because I was boring but my friends would smoke weed, cigarettes, take pills, even do cocaine occasionally and I wouldn't do anything but drink alcohol so I'd tell my parents the truth about what my friends did because I wanted them to be proud of me for not doing that stuff.

|-| cnv03cz || 198 || I delivered pizza for 3 years and made more money now than I am working as a post grad temp($13/hr), but I also don't spend $300ish (depends on hours) a month in gas, so it's a trade off. Most Friday and Saturday nights if you factor in tips I'd make a bit more than $20/hr, but it was generally for only 3-4 hour bursts. When I started opening on the weekends it was nice because I'd get about 8-10 hours a day on my pay checks then make at least $120 on both Saturday and Sunday. And if it's football season? I'd sometimes make $500 from tips alone from a Friday night shift then opening Saturday and Sunday.  
  
It's really dependent on hours, though. I worked 35-40 hours a week and worked longer shifts, but ti worked because I was still in school so working weird hours was easy. If you get into it but only work about 20 hours a week, you're generally working 3 hour rushes and while the burst money is okay, you aren't building the money on your paycheck and you aren't going on trips where you take 4-5 deliveries which is super efficient time/money wise.   |-|

|-| cnv0a15 || 3760 || I used to work for a small clothing store at a resort hotel in Waikiki.  I worked many retail jobs in my time in Hawaii and had to deal with about as many rude customers as you would anywhere else, but something about this place put all the customers in a good mood (maybe the fact we were on the beach) and I almost never had to deal with rude people.  It was a fairly slow gig too, which gave my coworkers and I a lot of downtime for BSing, which we did plenty of.  It was the only retail job I ever had where I never felt stressed out.

On a lot of days we would open the doors to let the tropical breeze in.  The standard outfit was shorts, T-shirt and flip-flops.  Us guys who worked their loved to flirt with the girls in a little jewelry kiosk next to us and we would get hit on regularly by bored teen girls and their drunk, middle aged mothers looking for a tropical island fling.  We used to actually fight for who got to take out the trash, because the dumpster was on the beach.  We would always time trash takeout for sunset and even the manager didn't get angry when it mysteriously took us ten minutes to go to the dumpster and back.  At the time I was living in a studio apartment in Waikiki just a couple blocks away and it was a ten minute walk to work for me.

If that job had paid a living wage I'd probably still be there, but I couldn't afford to live off my salary there, so I had to quit, move back to the mainland and go to grad school so I could get a career job.  I'm a college professor now, making a decent living in a respectable career, but sometimes I wish I was still selling T-shirts on the beach in Waikiki.

As long as you're able to groom/dress yourself into a professional appearance, are good at talking to people, can put up with a ton of bullshit, and have a strong desire to make a ton of money, you'll get a job. I've lost count of how many people I've seen going from $10/hr crap jobs to $60,000+ in only a year in that business.

But there's lots of sacrifice. It's brutal, soul-crushing work. You will lose much of your free time and your weekends and the amount of time spent at work will strain your relationships and possibly your health. It's totally possible to do it while keeping the moral high road but you will end up working with people who lie and cheat their way through life. 

But it's a great way to make money and a great way to gain experience. If you need to seriously increase your earning potential- get in, make some good money for 3 or so years, and get out. By that point you'll have the experience to do plenty of other things if you want. |-| 
|-| cnv0kdx || 342 || Bacon. Not as a food to enjoy, obviously, but the weird worshiping around it.

I can remember it being a big thing on here a couple of years ago, people talking about how great bacon was, it would be an answer in every AskReddit thread, and it was pretty funny. Then it started to spread, and a few months later annoying radio morning shows were holding contests where you could win bacon, for some reason. It was as if liking bacon made you part of some super secret society. I thought it was toast, a fun idea of "bacon being awesome" went weirdly mainstream, so it must be close to running its course, right?

Wrong. It's persevered, and gets thrown in to all kinds of marketing and contests and foods where it doesn't belong.

I just want to order bacon and eggs without some random guy talking about it as if we're in some exclusive bacon eating club.

Lots of whats and wheres and whys were shouted before I came to accept the temporal paradox I'd just experienced. I'd really rather not have my sense of time fucked with in the future. 

I once had it as a kid, too, even dressed up and was ready to go to the kindergarten and all (I went to sleep in the dark, woke up in the dark as well during winter time). I still remember the sense of "what the shit" when I got told to get back in the bed, it's only 10PM. |-|

I guess he woke up after a creepy dream and saw a dark figure that looked like it was crouching over our computer desk, and it sounded like someone was whispering.

|-| cnv15ny || 1308 || I have two stories from college that if ever found out my parents would surely kill me. Both of these moments could have severely altered my future and ruined my life. These were 4-5 years ago. I will share one for now and the other if there is any interest as these are very long stories.

Towards the end of high school I started using some different pills and this carried into college. Typical stuff like oxycodone, xanax, kilopins (sp?). Anyways my junior year in college I had a very high tolerance towards xanax and one particular night we were going to a pretty big house party in an area of campus I had never been. I didn't know the people hosting the party and I found out about it late so I was actually 9.5mg of xanax down at this point. If you don't know that is an insane amount of xanax and for some people could easily cause you to OD. At this time I was a 6'3" 280lbs male with a high tolerance so I was still functional.

We get to the party and I get about 6 beers deep and at this point I am wrecked beyond believe. I go into the bathroom to piss and being the douche bag I was I looked through the medicine cabinets and drawers of the bathroom. I found a full script of adderall which I had never taken before, and some other various paraphernalia I am going to leave out as they are not important to the story. So once again being the douche bag I am I decide all of this is going home with me. I had brought a backpack with me to transport all of my beers to the party so I put it on. I went around and told all of my friends I was feeling VERY sick and needed to get home. I am never one to not hold my alcohol/drugs so they know something is wrong.

So I head to the bathroom and fill my backpack up and splash water on my face and cough a lot to make myself look sick. We then all headed out and started our walk back to our apartment. Not 4 minutes into our walk we are stopped by the police because it was about 1-2am and we were walking down the street of campus and they wanted to make sure the girls were okay. Note at this point here are 6 of us and of the 6, 2 of us are 21 (I am 20) and the other 3 are 20 as well. The cop asked us if we were all of age and we all said yes. The 2 people who are 21 offer up their licenses really quick and that was enough to appease the cop. If he had ID'd all of us I would have gotten a drinking ticket and potentially had my bag searched. Had I been caught I would have had chargers for underage drinking, paraphernalia, a stolen controlled substance, intent to distribute (it was a full script so a huge amount of adderall not to mention I had cellophane), and to top it all off I was on school property. This would have probably resulted in a short jail sentence and being expelled from my university.

So after all of this we are EX TACTIC and my friends could not believe what I had done as I am not typically this kind of person. We go back to our apartment and the girls go to bed and it is just us 4 guys left. We start doing mass amounts of adderall smoking weed and drinking. In total we had I believe 30-40 pills of 30mg adderall. Note at this time we had all been up since 9-10am and it is now 3am. We continue getting fucked up, smoking cigs, watching entourage episodes and occasionally playing super mash bros. All of the sudden my girlfriend wakes up and it is 10am the next day. We are still partying. Eventually we run out of beers and just keep taking adderall and doing what ever it is we can find as we are all so amped up (none of us had done it before). We were playing with hand sanitizer and fire for a good couple of hours (if you have never done this while annihilated I definitely recommend it). Eventually it comes down to just me and my one other friend.

We are just chilling in his room doing more adderall and smoking some cigs while he plays on his electric piano. This is where shit got nuts. Note it is about 10 PM at this point and we had been awake roughly 36 hours and abusing this adderall. I started seeing call of duty on my friends TV screen which is turned off. I don't know how or why but it was the most insane hallucination I have ever had. I then realize that just about anything I start focusing on is absolutely nuts. My buddy starts seeing odd things as well and we realize that we are hallucinating from the drugs and sleep deprivation. We spent the next 5-6 hours just staring at stuff and walking around outside smoking cigs and looking like retards. Of all of the things we saw the craziest was staring at this [poster.](http://www.123posters.com/images/nature/n-atomic2.jpg) The best way to describe it was "colored warfare". It is so hard to really describe it but I could see bombs going off and gun shots and the breeze in the tree tops.

After all of that insaneness my buddy had finally had enough and went to bed. Now he had probably 6-7 pills of adderall to my 20. I tried to go to bed and eventually realized it was never going to happen. I started having an insane panic attack and sweating like crazy. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't calm down, I felt like I was falling and going to die. I have had panic attacks before as I suffer from mental illness but nothing like this. Nothing could calm me down and my girl friend began to worry. I had been up for over 48 hours and I finally decided to call the school toxicology line. I told them everything I had taken to the T and the advised me to immediately go to the hospital.

I knew that I did that my parents would surely catch me as I was on their insurance. So I tried my best to just deal with it and sleep. At about 10 AM I finally gave up and had my GF take me to the ER. This was the worst experience of my life. I had to wait almost 3 hours before seeing a doctor all the while feeling like I could die at any moment. I felt like everything was sucking air out of me and I couldn't breathe. They eventually let me sit a room alone so I could try to calm down while repeatedly asking me if I tried to kill myself because of the amount of drugs I had taken.

Eventually I was seen by a doctor and he was SHOCKED at the fact I was awake. He told me no matter how much adderall I took there is no way it could off set that much xanax. I tried to explain that I had never done adderall and I had done xanax multiple times but he still couldn't understand why I was awake. After running some tests they gave me a shot of something and sent me on my way. I got home and slept for over 24 hours straight and woke up feeling like I was dead.

I called my dad and told him I had a stomach problem which he believed and I got 100% away with it all. I have not done a prescription drug since that awful day.

|-| cnv23vt || 13 || I'm only 17, so it would have to be the fact that I've been smoking, drinking, and doing drugs for years. 

Whenever someone even brings up the very notion to my mother that I could be smoking pot, she aggressively dismisses it, saying I would never do such a thing. I also know she smokes grass from time to time so it's a little strange she's so militantly against it. Weed is not the only drug I've done though, I've done coke, acid, shrooms, heroin, and a few others (I am by no means proud of this), and if she or my dad ever found out about any of this, their perception of me would surely change for the worse. By no means have I done these drugs out of need, purely recreational purposes. 

I also live a very nuetral middle class life, not rich nor poor, so these factors do not affect this portion of my life. 


They also think I have a vast variety of friends, and I really don't, I only have a few close friends who I barely feel close to anymore. I'm that friend who will hang out anytime, anywhere, and is always cracking jokes and shit, but I really don't feel a sense of belonging anywhere, ya know? My parents think I'm all a-okay in my world, when really I'm not, if they know how I really feel, I personally think they'll think of me differently, for good or bad, I don't know. 


And while I'm ranting and venting, they think I'm doing pretty okay in school, which I am, but I'm not doing good enough to get into a college and/or get a scholarship (my gpa is about 3.0). They don't know this, and I don't plan on telling them, they are fucking clueless when it comes to how the modern education system works. I am basically going to be fucked when admission time comes around and they are baffled as to why I didn't get into any schools, let alone any schools worth two dimes and a fuck. 


If they ever found out about any of it, and I mean any of the above I just mentioned,  It could really fuck over my relationship with them for the future, and since they are the most important people in my life, this will really kill me. 



Edit: after re-reading this seems a little melodramatic, but I'm currently sitting alone at lunch and am kind of sad so fuck it, I'll vent in an askreddit thread if I want to

I knew my mom wouldn't buy them for me, so I grabbed them (sneakily), and put them in my pocket (sneakily).

I felt pretty guilty the whole way home, and didn't make eye contact with anyone in case they could read my mind.

As soon as I was inside the safety of my home, I made my way upstairs (sneakily), and opened my hot goods.

They were awful.

Easily my least favorite tic-tac. I ended up throwing them in the garbage can outside (sneakily) to avoid any suspicion. 

This is my shame, and I carry it alone. Except now with theoretically thousands of people.

|-| cnv2zdt || 4249 || When I was about 11 or 12 I was going through my pyromaniac stage.  One Saturday, I decided I would grab a steel can and fill it with Gasoline and head to the woods.  Now, this wasnt just your typical ol' can of spegetti-O's, this was a 1 gallon bulk sized can...filled to the brim.  I took it to the woods and decided it would be cool just to light it on fire and see what would happen.  I lit it and it caught like I expected and kept burning inside the can.  After about 15mins I got bored and went to try and put it out.  In the process, I knocked the can over spreading gasoline all over the forest floor and it erupted in a ball of flame.  I quickly ran back to my house to get water and I come running back with about 5 gallons.  By this point the fire had spread tremendously and my efforts were useless.  I decided my best bet would be to run inside and play video games.  Luckily this spot in the woods was pretty good ways away from my parents house so it didnt draw my parents attention immediately.  After about an hour or so, the entire fire department is on scene battling the 3-4acres of forest fire that is roaring.  There was a road that runs behind my house and the fire basically engulfed all of the forest separating my parents house and this road.  This road is notorious for drug dealers and meth houses.  While the firefighters are trying to battle the flames, it is discovered that the house closest to the fire is a rather large cook house and cops show up and a huge bust goes down.  Naturally, the fire was blamed on them and my parents just accepted that.  

It is now 20 years later and my parents still do not know nor will they ever know.  

**TL;DR Set fire to 3-4acres of woods.  Meth house got blamed. Parents will NEVER know.** |-|

When I was about 10 I discovered the ability to jerkin my gerkin. Oh those were great times tuggin in the shower. I soon after discovered the vast word of the Internet and it's dark places. 

One day I decided to start going at it in my room. Well it was about time to finish up and had nowhere to shoot. Soooo I splooged on the floor and rubbed it in. No big deal right? Our carpet was an off white so when I rubbed it in it would just disappear....

I did this for 10 years people.

I had NO idea jizz smelled. 

I guess neither did my parents. 

One day they started to notice the stench. They chalked it up to my dog always laying in my room and my friends having stank ass feet. As did I. 

One day I got curious after learning jizz glows under black light. Borrowed my bothers black light, went to my room, closed the door, flipped the switch, and....

HOLY SHIT. The carpet in my room was brighter than the morning sun. I noped the fuck out of there with that black light and buried that memory to this day. 

4 years later my gf starts going on and on about how jizz smells like dirty wet dog and feet after its dry..... and it clicks....My room stank of jizz for years. 

That's a dirty secret I'll take to the grave. 

TL;DR my room was a literal jizz palace. 


Edit: lmfao this blew up. You guys crack me up. Glad to know I wasn't the only one splooging all over the carpet in my room.

|-| cnv3sq4 || 105 || I'm sick of people complaining about being underpaid... to the point where they're struggling to pay rent, eat, etc.

Yet they have no problem going home and watching their cable television, surfing the internet on their $500 smartphones, and maintaining expensive habits like smoking and/or going out every weekend.

I hear so many people complain that they don't make enough money, but their prioritization *sucks* when it comes to how they spend that "little" money they make.

And I realize this isn't the case for all people.  Some folks ARE underpaid and don't have enough to live comfortably.  I'm just sick of hearing the ones that do complain about their situations when they could easily be remedied.

*Edit: I really seem to have hit a nerve considering some of the posts below and, more so, the several PMs I've received.  So let me put some qualifiers here to help clear up what I meant by my above post:*

* I am NOT talking about people who have lost their jobs and had to take a significant pay cut.
* I am NOT talking about people who bought during the housing crisis and are now underwater.
* I am NOT making a blanket statement about smartphones.
* I am NOT saying you can't have three television sets.
* I am NOT talking about people who make very little money and do the best they can.

If you suffered from an unforeseen circumstance, and you're in financial difficulty because of it, that sucks.  And I understand that.  I understand shit happens and you need to make adjustments.

The people I am referring to in my post, however, are those who make enough to live comfortably but *choose* not to and then act like it's not their own fault.

And this has *nothing* to do with income past a certain point.  As I said in one of my comments below, there are athletes who make millions, then five years later they're filing for bankruptcy.  Why?  Because they felt they needed a half million dollar Bentley, a mansion, and five other cars.  They partied every night and blew their money on myriad things.  And then they act like the victims (not in all cases to be sure, but in some).

These are the people I'm faulting.  Using things like top-level cable packages, smartphones, and laptops was just my way of listing examples.  It could be an SUV, an in-ground swimming pool, etc.  They're just examples.  I'm not making blanket statements about any items in particular.  My point is, if you can afford it and live comfortably, more power to you.  If you can't, but you still decide to spend your money on those things, then don't complain that you're not making enough.  |-|

|-| cnv3up0 || 918 || Walmart, about 18 years ago.  

I was working as a union organizer, and kept going into a walmart to talk to workers there about the benefits of the union.

I would talk to two or three people, and then a manager would catch me and kick me out.  The second time I was told to not come back, but of course I did.  The third, fourth, and fifth times I was charged with petty tresspass.  The sixth, seventh, and eighth times I was charged with petty tresspass and breaching a court order.  The ninth and tenth times I was charged with petty tresspass and contempt of court.

In court dealing with the 10th charge of petty tresspass, three breach of court order and one contempt charge, we reached a plea agreement.

I consented to a lifetime ban from walmart.  The union agreed to stand surety in the amount of $10,000 for any breach of that ban in the process of conducting union business.  I was given a conditional discharge on one count of petty tresspass, and the rest of the charges were dropped.

On a side note, I was arrested by the same cop every time.  He and I got to know each other a bit, and until he got transferred to a different province we used to get together for coffee once a month or so and argue politics.  We had some pretty interesting conversations about the role and function of police forces,  the value or lack thereof of community oversight on police, and a really interesting debate regarding racist cops - are they created by taking non-racist cops and having them deal with a particular ethnic group all the time, or are they already racist and just now have enough exposure to a particular ethnic group to really shine? |-|

|-| cnv4gch || 51 || "Cultural appropriation." 

"Rape culture." 

"Racism." 

Basically 99% of everything that third-wave feminists get all up in arms about. 

Look, I'm aware there are legitimate issues faced by blacks, and by women, and by rape victims. I get that. But I'm not the next Hitler because I don't get consumed by seeing-red rage when some white girl wears an Indian headdress to Bonnaroo or a black guy gets gunned down for assaulting a police officer. 

EDIT: The reason I put those words up top in quotes is because they're the air-quoted version of legitimate issues. Like racism. Racism is still a thing, don't get me wrong. There are still people who get discriminated against based on the color of their skin, and we should be working to change that mentality. But it seems every time anything even remotely negative happens to someone who isn't white, the knee-jerk reaction of overly-sensitive liberals is "IT MUST BE RACISM!" when there could very well be other factors.  |-|

|-| cnv4ics || 82 || Not high school, but in middle school a girl died of some form of cancer. I had gone to elementary school with her and for some reason I have this random memory of talking to her or being near her on picture day (waiting in line). She was honestly a sweet girl and didn't deserve what she went through.


I remember the day they announced it over the intercom in middle school. It was a dark day.

|-| cnv4nf0 || 3 || My cousin has a kid, his brothers know, I know, but his parents do not.  I initially told him, he should tell them but at this point not sure the difference it would make.  

The kid is now about 5, he has never seen the kid, but is still friends with the mom.  She has since moved with someone else.  It was a pretty interesting story.  I found out about a year ago when we got a little drunk.

I figure, my cousin has enough pressure anyway, he's currently in his 8th year in college (no bachelors yet), had a drug problem (think he has since cleaned up), and has Crohn's Disease. 

The Crohn's Disease isn't being helped due to his weekend drinking so maybe piling on the whole I haven't told you about my kid for 5 years might not be the best for his parents to continue managing his college degree fund. |-|

|-| cnv4pgz || 420 || I personally never did, but when I was working for a *big electronics retailer* (Yeah, that one) we banned a customer because he was abusing the return policy. We had our suspicions that the guy was a digital camera reviewer of some kind, because he kept buying cameras (not cheap ones, good expensive ones) and returning them 2 days later saying it was simply a bad product. At first we believed him, not everyone has the same criterias when it comes to cameras. But he kept doing it, even for some models that any professional would've agreed were really good. After the 15th time, we told him he was not welcome in the store anymore. A few weeks later, we learned he started doing the same thing at a competitor. |-|

Don't get me wrong, I personally don't want kids (or at least I don't see it happening for a very long time), but people who choose to have kids and then do nothing but bitch and moan about them are the worst. They constantly complain about never having alone time and how much money and time their children cost them. Believe me, it makes your kids feel like shit when you talk like that. If you don't feel like sticking time and energy into them, don't fucking have them. And making your kid feel guilty or like they need to be grateful for every dime you spend on them (for basic stuff even) is just not okay.  |-|

My trusty Jack Russell, stirred by my excitement of this magical fresh start, tunnels her way from under the covers to stand with her front legs on my chest. She looks at me with a grin on her face. A God's honest grin, like she too understood the empty ledger before us. She sighs then promptly pukes on my chest.

So, one night, when he was away on a business trip, my brother and sister (who are both older than me) were fighting. I heard my mom tell them that if they didn't stop, she wasn't going to tuck them into bed. I assumed she wasn't going to tuck me into bed either (I was probably 6 at the time), so I started crying. When she came in to say good night to me, she asked why I was crying. I was embarrassed, so I told her I was crying because I missed dad. The next day, my dad sent me a bouquet of flowers and a cookie basket with a card that said "I miss you too!" I will never tell my dad that I didn't really miss him... |-|

|-| cnv4y3o || 1527 || There was this kid Walter. I wouldn't say I was friends with him, but I was in the same general group of people. See, Walter was one of those "weird kids" at the crossroad between weirdo goth kids and theater geeks. The vast majority of people never gave Walter the time of day, and plenty of them gave him shit for no reason. Walter, though, was one of the nicest people you could ever meet. Absolutely genuine dude with not a single bad intention.

His senior year, while riding his bike home (I believe from his girlfriend's house), Walter was hit and killed by a speeding driver. I'm from a small town, this is the sort of news that really shakes things up. All of a sudden, everybody was his grieving best friend. The sentiment was appreciated, but it made me sad to see all these people that wouldn't give this dude two thoughts when he was alive acting like they were the closest friends on Earth. |-|

This was a huge deal at the school, and assemblies were held where other members of the faculty would pray over him (the school had a weird, hip, 'new' Catholic thing going on...a lot of Christian rock was played) and whatnot.

We were later told we were successful, and he had beaten his cancer because they had prayed hard enough and god took the cancer away.  There was an entire assembly praising the power of prayer and how it can solve your problems, if it is god's will.

The cancer killed him two weeks later.

The boat smelled like mold and within the first few hours, water dumped out of the ceiling AC unit and onto my girlfriend's head. While showering the next day, the water was cut off. We decide to complain but the owner accused us of lying about everything. We came up with an elaborate lie about how we have to leave for a family emergency and need a refund. Nope. Well, somehow my girlfriend's crazy aunt got the places number and called to bitch the owner out about how the place sucked and we deserved a refund. That's where he caught us in the lie and kicked us out at 10pm. We ended up getting a refund thats to the crazy aunt, which was nice. |-|

My parents do not know because..


A. They were trying to help her, and I felt sorry for her. (I realize that her hurting me voids this, but for a preschoolers mind it didn't work that way.)


B. By the time I felt I could say something, so much time had passed that all I could see happening was me hurting my parents, making them blame themselves. Why do that? 



I see this person from time to time in passing at the supermarket, we have mutual acquaintances. People bring her up. That bothers me, I don't care what is happening in her life. I think she was going though some fucked up shit and passed it on. I feel sorry for her. When I see her I look her in the eye and stand strong. Almost to say "You know what you did and I am not broken because of it."...

|-| cnv5vrp || 13 || As far as I know... one guy I grew up with &amp; his friend died in a car accident. Another girl who was my friend in art passed away in her sleep. :( oh, and a classmate's older brother died in the bath tub. never heard what happened there. |-| 
|-| cnv5vvt || 3 || I used to wear my mom's lingerie when I was a little kid.

I was probably about 7 and discovered it under her bathroom sink. I put  it on, felt pretty or something, and would walk around in it. Fuckin' hilarious now that I think about it. Then I'd put it away like nothing happened. She was at work during this, for the record. 

Good news though, I'm not  a serial killer at all! I promise.  |-|

|-| cnv61m0 || 34 || This seems stupid to even write but I can never share with my parents where I stand on political issues. Opposite of a lot of stories I've seen on reddit, I am actually more conservative than my mom and step dad. They are about as far left as possible and it's painful to hear them talk about things in their "I smell my own farts" manner. And I'm really just somewhere in the middle. But to them, it would be much more extreme. 

The closest I ever came to talking to them about this was the time I realized I really never could. And all I'd said was that, if people would just take a step back, they would realize that both parties are broken and there is no one right answer. That did not end well.

|-| cnv61w4 || 30 || My junior year a lot of people died. 3 in a car crash, a kid in my class went nuts and stabbed his mom and two sisters to death, and a couple others committed suicide. 2002-2003 year was very strange |-| 
|-| cnv61z3 || 9 || I didn't know this guy that well, but he was friends with my friend. Hanged out in a same group a couple of times. One foggy morning, he was driving his motorcycle to school, probably didn't see that he was already on that part of the roead where it makes a 90 degree turn and drove off the road. Unfortunately there was a traffic sign and he happened to collide with it. Someone found him there, elaready dead. I really hope he died instantly.

Other guy commited a suicide. Didn't know him at all, he was younger and he seemed to be very antisocial. Poor kid. |-| 
|-| cnv63rl || 6 || That I suffered and still suffer from mental issues, do to their bickering and fighting around me ever since I was born... My mother only had me because, my grandmother called her out on being pregnant before she could either drown me with alcohol or get an abortion. She still blames me for everything that went wrong in her life and relationship with my father (who was suppose to be a "quick fuck" at the time.) even though she married him when I was 4 and had another kid 3 years later then divorced when I was 14.

I clearly remember asking her when I was 5 to leave my father, because he was so verbally abusive to her (which he started to to me when I got breasts).

If I told them this affected my mental health, they'd probably turn it on me and say it was my fault that I was depressed, anti-social, have an irrational fear of door bells, and feel greatly stressed out when in an enclosed room with only an interviewer present... |-| 
|-| cnv63t3 || 271 || My best friend's girlfriend.  
It was awful and it was one of the reasons we drifted apart. We lived a crappy version of Dawson's Creek. Full story below:  
I met my best friend on the first day of High School. It was my second school after failing a year of prep school. He was the first man who flirted with me and actually noticed I was severely depressed. Slowly he gained my trust and friendship.  
Fast forward a year, this girl enters the picture. She's crazy about my friend but he's crazy about somebody else: me. He tells me and I tell him that we had this weird special connection that was better than romance. In other words, I loved him but I wasn't in love with him.  
He starts dating a lot. This girl suffers through all his flings, and his discovery of bisexuality. My friend starts secretely dating a guy, this guy's parents find out, they break up and I stay silent about it (our friends eventually found out after almost ten years).  
Another bout of serial dating later and finally it's this girl's turn. Suddenly things start working out. He dates her, she doesn't mind I come and go out of the picture. He was my best friend after all.  
We graduate, she's still in school. The summer after graduation I go backpacking through Europe and I get a call from my dad. The girl died.  
She was in a car crash and she was projected through the windshield. She was pronounced dead on the scene, and a gruesome picture is splattered all over the newspapers.  
Shit gets real really fast. He isolates himself of anything that reminds him about her, and that includes me. Calls become emails, emails become PMs and then eventually nothing.  
We are happy now but we are no longer friends. We always schedule stuff we never get to do. He's dated several guys and girls, and I've had my share of flings.  
Isn't it strange how one person changes things?   
Never in a million years I pictured my life without both of them. I thought we had it all figured out.  
We were so stupid.   |-| 
|-| cnv63uq || 4 || I paid for sex once and would do it again. |-| 
|-| cnv641o || 683 || An acquaintance I'd known since second grade was killed two years after graduation. 

He slipped on ice at a train station and fell onto the tracks as a train was approaching. Poor dude never had a chance. 

Mind the fucking gap, people.  |-| 
|-| cnv645s || 16 || When I was a junior in high school, the Homecoming queen died about a month after she got crowned in a car accident. |-| 
|-| cnv64dn || 7 || Blackjack dealer or any other casino dealer. For some the ethics of taking a poor person's money is questionable, but you make decent tips if people are winning and it can be a lot of fun. |-| 
|-| cnv64fd || 13 || A 15 year old boy. He was a genius, popular and was an athlete for my country. |-| 
|-| cnv64qh || 401 || Three times a year myself and about thirty others go on a pub crawl around a nearby town. It has been happening for many years (14 I think!) and is a great occasion to catch up with people who've been married, had children or become boring by another method.

I started attending these pub crawls when I was quite young, about twenty, and had little money. I invented "inter-pub-wine" which was a bottle of wine one would keep on your person to drink between the pubs. I also kept a hip flask of vodka on me too. I know this is naughty and unfair on the pubs and all that but I was young and reckless and wished to be drunk without spending money. In most pubs I would order a small coke and subtly pour my vodka into it.

I thought I was quite sly about that until about eight years later when I've just started dating my girlfriend, literally met her the week before, and decided the pub crawl would be a great time to introduce her to everyone. I can just about afford to buy booze now so I'm being good, buying pints of lovely cider in the pubs and I've forgone my inter-pub-wine.

I was, I think, impressing my new girlfriend up until this point. We entered pub #8 and the girl behind the bar immediately says "I'm not serving you!" to me. This is embarrassing. I ask why and she tells me that I've not actually been very subtle and bar staff will notice if the guy just drinking soft drinks somehow gets steadily drunker with each one.

I apologise, proclaim to be a changed and honest man, and she agrees to serve me. But alcohol only. I end up buying a pint for myself and, to be able to buy a soft drink for my girlfriend, I was forced to buy a small lemonade and a separate shot of vodka. This has continued every year since.

TL;DR: Barred from buying soft drinks in a pub due to being a cheap student in my past. |-|

For context, I had talked to my parents for consult about my interest in becoming trans (MtF), and they literally just shut me out from everything. Like, no internet, no school, I couldn't even talk to friends or family until they somehow killed any remote feelings for it. It took a week of home bootcamping on why no one would ever accept a transgender, not even my parents, and how I would be alone for the rest of my life. Now I can't own anything that has a girl remotely in it otherwise my parents will think I'm contaminated again.

After a year of a bit of self-discovery, I just found out that I like pretending to be a girl with a penis. So I got that going for me. |-|

|-| cnv685f || 274 || Unfortunately, my high school had three people die while I was there.

When I was a freshman, a senior girl died in a car wreck. She drove through the median on a highway and was hit by an 18-wheeler.

When I was a sophomore, a senior guy died in, IIRC, a ~~[dirk bike](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view3/3672335/dirk-nowitzki-exercise-bike-o.gif)~~ dirt bike accident.

When I was a junior, one of my friends, who was a junior, died in a car wreck on a on a one-lane country road. He drove into a tree. Dealing with this one sucked. I cried a lot.

Edit: My high school had only about 300 students, so the deaths had a pretty big impact.

Also, regarding the girl who died, her older sister died in a car wreck a few years before she did. Her older brother was murdered a few years later along with two other guys while they were riding ATVs and dirt bikes by a particular crazy guys hows. The youngest of the four siblings in this particular family is the only who lives. It's pretty insane. |-|

It was very surreal, and I was too shaken to even attend the funeral. 

Another girl had half her car smashed in by a tipped truck, killing her mom the week after we graduated.  |-| 
|-| cnv6a9k || 49 || Kid from my school died last week. He was driving along a country road that I used to drive every single day, and then he got hit by another car. He died 3 days later.

So not in school, but a couple years later.

He was a really nice guy. I know everyone says that, but this time it was genuinely true. |-| 
|-| cnv6ajs || 3453 || I was 10-ish and my dad had just painted the boiler room door orange in our basement. My younger brother and I were pushing each other around on a skatebaord in basement and my dad warned us, don't you dare hit this door with your skateboard. 15 minutes later I'm picking my brother up from the ground and looking at a hole in my dad's orange door caused by said skateboard. Definitely not telling dad. Instead I grab a piece of orange construction paper and a glue stick to "patch" the hole. It matched surprisingly well. 27 years later that construction paper is still holding strong and I have never heard a word about it from my pop.

**Edit: I just blew my cover y'all, just for you. I texted my mom and asked her to take a photo of the door. Looks like the years have faded it. So by request, [here is a photo of the door](http://i.imgur.com/WUm6waW.jpg).**

|-| cnv6bqh || 1916 || At 16 I was banned from the local Sports Chalet for accidentally discharging a can of bear mace and it getting sprayed onto a baby that a mother was pushing in a stroller. 

-Okay, more detail... It was summertime in 1997. Back then, we would skateboard around town getting kicked out of places for skating on stairs, rails, whatever. So we would explore stores since skateboarding was a crime. 

We were looking around the outdoor section of Sports Chalet and found bear mace. It was something that appeared super humorous to us as we never knew such a thing existed. So like any curious teen with a weapon the size of a small fire extinguisher, we started to open the packaging to get a better look at it. I don't remember what it had for a safety. But our backs were to the aisle as the lady and baby walked by and the furious discharge from one of us setting it off freaked us out. 

It got in our eyes and we sprinted to the bathroom. We were trying to neutralize it when the manager ran in there and yelled at us. We had no idea we almost post-birth aborted that baby. He walked us out and told us to never come back.

A month later my father wanted to sign us up for SCUBA lessons. He got certified when he was 16 and wanted to go through it with me when I was 16 so we could hang out underwater together. Guess where he signed us up at... Turns out the store manager was also the Dive Master. 

I wondered if he would recognize me. He did. He took me aside at the end of the first day and told me, "I remember you from a month ago..." And good guy Dive Master left it at that. He didn't even tell my father. Maybe because the program was $500/person? But that's all I have to say about that... 

[My SCUBA card.](http://i.imgur.com/dYmLAsT.jpg) Just for fun!

Things like costumes, shoes, athletic equipment all fall under tax deductible work items.

|-| cnv6esi || 4 || Little late to the party but worth telling

I don't know about anywhere else, but in Texas schools, we have this weird discipline system where each class had a chart with a green, yellow, and red spot on it, green being good, yellow meaning you've been warned/timeout or whatever, and red being office referral.
Just to warn everyone, I was always the goody goody kid who had to have good grades and be perfect and stuff. I apologize for anyone I ever interacted with as a child.
It was the first week of school, in third grade. It was Friday, which meant library day. I was exited, because that also meant I got to see Mrs. N, the elderly librarian. She was my favorite teacher.
We had just gotten back from recess when my teacher announced it was time to go to the library.I was elated. I eagerly got in line, (wasn't the line leader, not cool enough), and began to head out. To my despair, the class took a turn not toward the library, but toward the playground! And I didn't have my sunglasses! I quickly rushed back into the classroom to grab them so I could go outside.
Apparently, I wasn't as blindingly fast as I had assumed I would be, because the teacher came back in wondering where I was. Upon seeing me dig through my desk, she was furious. I was given a stern talking-to and was forced to change my color from green to yellow.
At the end of the day, everyone in my class had to color in that date on our calendars with whatever color they ended up on and then show it to the teacher to get it signed first by her and then by our parents.
I colored mine in green and never showed it to the teacher.
No one ever found out.

Another guy (who was always in trouble at school) died while riding dirt bikes with friends. They invited some girls our riding with them, but didn't have enough helmets so he gave his to one of them. He came around a corner fast, and crashed into his friend coming from the other direction.

Fortunately I lived close to the bar and made it home every night. It got to the point where I was coughing/puking up blood in the morning. I think that was due to smoking nearly a pack a night and irritating my throat. I rarely missed work, and even though my parents were worried about me (They lived 1200 miles away) I kept reassuring them that I was fine and happy. But I was a miserable drunk who did many questionable things that I regret.

Everything is always not to their standards, and in the rare time that I do something right its nit picking small things I did wrong. They also hold money over my head as why I have to do anything they say. "I pay for this house" "I'm paying for your college" and not to forget how much they discuss how terrible the economy is and how bad their small business is doing. Never in a million years will I let my children understand the entirety of the families money, whether it be good or bad, that's something they shouldn't even have to think about. 

I feel like a little shit for growing up in a very nice house and a family who was well off, but all of that being put onto me has made me want to get out of there so bad. The only reason I chose the college I did was to leave home, and no other reason than that. A lot of my friends and my girlfriend I know would take my life in a heart beat, but the truth is I would rather have something less.  |-|

|-| cnv73lo || 40 || When I was a junior I had class with a well-liked girl (who I'll call C) who did chorus. She wasn't popular like cheerleader popular but she was very bubbly and was always surrounded by friends. I personally thought she was a bit annoying, but didn't know her all that well so I guess I can't talk.  One day in class our teacher assigns a group test so we formed groups of three and got to work. C was not in my group nor had I ever really talked to her but she kept trying to get us to give her group an answer.  I know it was a collaborative test, but I still considered that cheating so the more she asked the more annoyed I got.

Fast forward one week and C is in a coma.  Teachers and students are a wreck.  Turns out she and her boyfriend (R) were getting it on at her house when his mother walked in and saw them. Ashamed, embarrassed, scared, whatever, she flees from the house and speeds away in her car.  She'd snuck out so I'm guessing her intention was to get home fast...but it was dark and it was rainy.  Coming around a curve at high speed, she careens off the road and dives right down a ravine.  

Doctors induced a coma due to the swelling in her brain but her condition worsened.  Following a week of constant updates on her health, her family decided to take her off of life support. 

Back at school, a procession of people stood by her boyfriend as he marched through the school hallway.  The spring chorus concert was performed in her memory.  I attended her wake and mourned for her family and friends.

R became a good friend of mine the next year.   I try not to judge C and R for some gossip I heard about them before her death.  That they both cheated on each other during their relationship. That she lost her virginity to another guy while C and R were dating. It may have just been more news running through the rumor mill but hearing people portray her as so sweet and innocent still left a bad taste in my mouth.

Writing this up and thinking about it more, I feel kind of guilty.  I won't ever know if those rumors were true, and if they were true, does it even matter?  Unfortunately, her bothering me during that test and the gossip I heard are pretty much all I have to go on. I'll try to look at it more impartially from now on.

He had cancer and it seemed like there was  a new fundraiser every week  to help him pay for his medications (in Canada, doctors visits are covered, but you usually need to pay for prescriptions unless you have a good drug plan) - usually by selling candy or bracelets or stuff like that. He died just before he would have graduated.

|-| cnv7fgi || 1091 || 11th Grade, Stats and Trigonometry -- a tragic story. 

In order to teach us about statistics we were instructed to collect the age and gender of all the obituaries in our small town's weekly paper.  A senior in the class, we'll call him Doug, complained openly about how morbid the practice was.  His exact quote "If I died, would you guys just collect my stats next week?"

The next week was to be our last week of data collection.  Doug was driving home after school on a rainy day. The road home for him was a sparsely used highway north of town. Driving downhill his car began to hydroplane.  An oncoming van full of 6 senior citizens from a nursing home began to skid as well.  They smashed into each other, killing everyone in both vehicles.  Some of the kids in his class lost both him and a grandparent in that same crash.

We didn't collect data from the obituaries the next week.

|-| cnv7l0a || 10 || Comic book superhero movies, and really just superhero movies in general. In the past it has been a fad. We'll see a few but they're kind of hammy and don't really go anywhere. Today though it's become the keystone of the entire industry and there is no end in sight, but more interestingly(to me at least) is that just about *every* movie has become effectively a 'superhero' movie. Sure enough protagonists always survive and 'win' anyway, but the manner in which that is happening in movies, even movies about regular people with no superpowers has started to become completely over-the-top and incredible. Star Trek, The Hobbit, Die Hard, Transformers the non-super powered members of the Avengers, and several others feature essentially regular humans who behave all but indistinguishably from superheroes. The spectacle has just completely taken over and crowded out just about any other component of film making and again, there appears to be no end in sight. These movies are making more money than studios even thought was possible to make once upon a time and they've perfected the formula for production *and* marketing to such a degree that it feels like even if people do sort of get sick of them it won't even matter.

Nate died first and was taken by a motorcycle accident when he was roughly 15.  I saw him about an hour before in the locker room after practice as he was mentioning that him and some friends were going riding when they got home.  The last thing I said to him was "don't get yourself killed out there".

Stuart died about a year afterwards from a car accident.  Drunk driving.  Got too drunk at a new year's eve party.  Rolled his vehicle in the ditch driving home, was thrown out of the vehicle, and subsequently broke his neck on impact with the frozen ground.

Mike died a couple years after high school but it hurt me more because I was really good friends with him and I still miss him dearly.  He was also taken in a car accident.  The tragic part of this was that he was married for roughly one month before his death.  He didn't come home one night as his crash was single vehicle and was in a rural area.  Finally his wife got worried and checked the path between his dad's house and their place and she found his corpse frozen in a field after he was also thrown out of the vehicle.

It's shit like this that makes me dead inside. |-|

When you learn to drive, your parents don't teach you how to put it in gear and then stop.  They don't teach you how to work the radio and then stop.  They don't teach you how to open the door and then stop. 

They teach you how to drive, park, parallel park, brake, signal, merge, the whole shebang.  You need to know all of that to pass a test to be legally allowed to drive.

|-| cnv8mje || 209 || This happened in my freshman year of high school. 
So one of my friends got ahold of some weed , and i haven't tried it before so we had the stupid idea to smoke it. He came over along with some other friends of mine. The original plan was to go to forest near my house to smoke it, but it was cold so we didn't want to. One of us wanted to smoke it on my porch , but I disagreed. I forgot how , but we came up with the stupidest idea and HOTBOX in my bathroom. Keep in mind my parents were gonna be home from work in an hour, and if they found out my life would be done. We quickly made a shitty bong out of a Gatorade bottle , then removed everything from my bathroom. We lit up the weed and smoked for like 10 minutes. Once we were done we quickly cleaned up and emptied a whole Axe bottle in the bathroom. My friends being stoned as fuck left. I went back upstairs to check the bathroom and it smelled like flat out weed. I tried to use every possible thing to get the smell out but it didn't work. I called my parents (they have the same job) and they said they were 15 minutes away. I knew I was fucked. Now keep in mind my parents are EXTREMELY strict an if they caught me I would be over. This is when I thought of the stupidest thing any sane human would think. Burn my bathroom down. I ended up lighting some towels on fire and trying my hardest to burn the sink area. It ended up catching on fire but it was slow. I quickly called 911 and 3 minutes later fire department i see firetrucks out my house. They took care of the fire and my parents came home shocked. Half of my bathroom was charred and the door knocked down. Fire department said it was probably an electrical current from the outlet that burned a towel. I slept that night thinking how stupid I was and what I just did. To this day my parents don't know..

TL:DR - hotboxed in my bathroom and set fire to it to get the smell out and prevent from being caught. Parent still think it was an accident... |-|

|-| cnv98vn || 146 || My actual Grades |-| 
|-| cnv99bd || 13 || Firstly, I hope I don't bum anyone out here with my situation.

My parents are both staunchly non-violent people, they do not believe in the death penalty, they are pro-life, die-hard Christians, etc., etc., and so forth.  While my father served in the military during Vietnam due to the draft, he was a conscientious objector, and was an MP (military police) for his entire tour of duty and refused to carry a sidearm, much to the consternation of his superiors.  He was willing to carry a nightstick and mace / pepper spray, since they were non-lethal.  Fortunately, the bulk of his time in service was mostly collecting drunken soldiers and ensuring they made it to their racks (beds).

I did not follow the same path of military service.  I enlisted in the Navy and found myself aboard a submarine, initially.  Due to a medical condition that became apparent while onboard, I was medically disqualified to serve on submarines and eventually ended up at Little Creek Naval Amphibious Base.  I was attached to an expeditionary warfare unit for the remaining four years of my enlistment.  During that time, I was forced to fire on enemy combatants many times.

In those four years, I saw the darker side of humanity.  Talking with my roommate on-base (I lived in the barracks my entire enlistment), I've come to realize that sometimes to protect others, you have to make the hard choices others may lack the conviction to make.  I realize I myself have become more hardened about life and people in general.  This is not to say I feel like my enlistment was a waste, or that I feel as though I wasn't justified in my actions.  I value my life and the life of my friends more than I do enemy combatants, no matter how unjustified or justified they may be.

Given my parents stance on life, I don't know how they would react to the things I did during military service.  As a result, I simply don't talk about it.  Apparently my grandfather was the same.  He served in World War II in the Navy as well, as a GM (Gunner's Mate) on various landing craft in the Pacific, usually manning a .50 machine gun to provide cover and supporting fire for infantry.  For reasons that I don't know to this day (He died when I was 19, I was 22 when I entered into military service), Pappy told me lots of stories of his time in World War II.  I guess, because of my father's religious beliefs and stance on killing, he felt like he couldn't share these things with Dad.  So he told them to me.

To top it all off, I'm the atheist in the foxhole.  Even under fire, even with friends wounded around me, I never once thought to ask God for help, because I don't believe any supernatural force is going to come rescue me or others.  And I don't believe God or any other deity did.  I don't believe in "spirituality" either.  I believe we are a descended relation of a common ancestor shared by apes and monkeys, who managed through a diet in dense nutrients (read: meat) to evolve larger brains and eventually consciousness.

The only person in my family who knows I'm an atheist is my older brother.  He is a photographer / painter, an agnostic, but fairly "spiritual", and his beliefs on life are more in line with my parents, but he's far more accepting a person.

EDIT:  I just want to say, I do not consider myself some military "badass".  My ex-girlfriends have remarked that I tend to be "closed off" or "somewhat aloof" and "intimidating upon first glance".  My most recent ex-girlfriend said that I, "just look imposing, like someone you wouldn't approach casually, like private security, I guess".  That's not to say I am not gregarious and friendly; many people, including my exes feel that way, I apparently give off some kind of "look" through posture and demeanor that people are - perhaps not wary of - but maybe... cautious, is the right word? |-|

If that were a joke and it stayed in its own space, that'd be fine. But there is a very popular, active sub dedicated to making people be pushy snobs. They constantly talk down to others and belittle other opinions. When someone points out that that's called "being a cunt," they retreat behind the "it's satire!" defense. Members who act like superior, condescending dicks in /r/games or /r/askreddit are highly upvoted as being great "brothers." "Someone was talking about the PS4 and a brother told him he was an idiot! Glorious!"

But, see, he wasn't in PCmasterrace. He wasn't trying to be satirical. He was just being a dick to someone who didn't like the same thing. And that's bullshit. I don't care if people prefer PC gaming and even hold the opinion that it's a better experience. That's cool. But when you have so many people actively going around and telling everyone else "your fun is stupid!" then you're just being douchebags. And when you take those extra steps to applauding your "brothers" who go around being snobs and hiding behind a flimsy "it's a prank!" defense to excuse your shitty behavior, you've made a game out of being a cunt. |-|

He didn't leave, he was let go for having an inappropriate relationship with a student. There were no details really just that.  Now, the school is religious based and my grandfather was a devote Christian man so it was quite shocking. I told my mom and we decided we couldn't tell my dad and we certainly couldn't let my grandmother know. We don't even know if he told her why he left.

I use the term inherited loosely because it's not like his family died or anything, they just moved somewhere else and still had the lease paid for half a year. Anyways, as a bunch of 17 year olds, we did the only logical thing: turn it into a hang out paradise.

Before college, before officially moving out, we put in money to furnish the place. We hung out there every weekend. Word spread through school and us, not so cool but not lame, right in the casual middle-type, started throwing parties people showed up for.

It was really great until we got so many complaints we got evicted.

We were there for a wedding, and for whatever reason everyone came to my room for the after-party as we were all in the same hotel. And while we weren't overly loud or raucous, unfortunately unbeknownst to us the block of rooms on either side of mine were reserved for guests in town for the funeral of a child.

Sensing it was getting a little too loud, too late, I herded everyone outside and down to the lake about 300 yards from the hotel. This prevented me from answering dozens of phone calls from the front desk.

I went to check out the next morning. The clerk asked for my room number, and when I told him he instantly turned, well, *cold*. 

"Have a good time last night?"

"Yeah," I replied. "Fun wedding."

"Well, it would be best if you never came here again. Ever. For any reason. Now smile." He took out a Polaroid (this was decades ago) and took my picture, and pinned it to the wall.

To this day I still feel bad, and unsure how it got to that. But it was a fun wedding.

|-| cnva1yd || 2484 || When you guys went to Hawaii I put Milo (cat) down. He was sick, in incredible pain, couldn't eat or drink, couldn't even move to get to the litterbox. When you left on vacation he was too weak to even yowl in pain anymore. I couldn't stand to see that cat in so much pain and so afraid so I did the only thing I could do to help him- end his life humanely. 

My parents were 100% against putting down a pet regardless of how much it is suffering so they'd be beyond mad if they knew this. |-| 
|-| cnva2ad || 6 || Hard to pin down exactly, but I often feel like the majority of complaints across my peers are all at least 5 years out of date if not more. Like if it is a complaint about music being shitty today they'll reference a pop star from 10 years ago as their example. (e.g. "I don't listen to Britney Spears or whatever") or maybe it'll be some bit of tech trivia (e.g. "iTunes DRM is so stupid") where it hasn't been like that in years. It's not difficult to get the impression sometimes that a lot of people I know kind of stopped paying attention to the world after high school ended when their frame of reference for so many things seems to be 10+ years old. So, can't really pin that down more specifically but basically I'm just sick of hearing people complain about something they haven't even thought about it years to where their complaint is outdated and no longer even applies but they still hold it with conviction.  |-| 
|-| cnva2zi || 123 || My best friend at the time got married, and within 2 months his wife left for the military. They were together about 2 years before hand, broke up a few times, and had a pretty rocky relationship. Getting married was their way of giving a middle finger to the world, that they were determined to stay together no matter what.  

From what I remember (this was a long time ago), she was going to join the military and then he was going to move to wherever she was stationed to live with her, as soon they could do that (after boot camp or whatever? I dunno how the US Army works).  

He drove up to visit her as soon as he was allowed to. He quickly realized he hated the place and hated the idea of having to move around every time she had to move. They got the marriage annulled or whatever soon after that. |-|

Busted them doing the nasty....it was never discussed again(I'm still not ok)...at the time of both incidents we all lived together and things were weird.

|-| cnvaihr || 2155 || A mini-golf course by my house. 

I was 12. I took $50 (all of my Birthday money) and I was dead set on having a good time at the local mini golf, arcade, pizza place. This place had an arcade and pizza parlor inside the main building. One of the machines was a coin pusher that was right next to the ticket booth / pay window at the back of the arcade. The coin pusher always had a good payout. People were winning all the time it dropped coins like crazy at least I thought so. 

So I figured $20 in quarters should allow me to win the roll of rubber banded cash on top of some more money. I put $20 in quarters into that machine and got the roll of money to the very edge. I was certain I was about to make bank. So I drop $10 more in and didn't get the money. The money was being held in place by Satan himself. So I kicked the machine out of young anger. The money roll dropped into the "win area" and an alarm went off on the machine. I quickly grabbed the roll of money and jammed in it my underwear. The security guard approaches me coming all the way from the main door. He takes me to an office via a side door. They tell me I'm banned for life for destroying their property, but they won't call my parents or the cops since I've haven't caused trouble before. I was also told I wouldn't be allowed to collect the money from kicking the machine. Little did they know that I had been collecting every coin as it dropped in the machine from my $30 already ( kids in the arcade were known for trying to steal it as it dropped) and I had the roll of money in my underwear from kicking the machine.

So I was banned for life, I walked home and counted my sweet $52 in winnings. 

EDIT: for those asking. I won $52 after my costs. I ended up with $82 in total. $75 from the rubber band roll of money and $7 in quarters dropped from my $30 spent knocking coins down. As to what I did with that money. I remember riding my bike to [Children Palace Toy Store](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_World) buying a GI Joe action figure, Ghost Busters figure (I distinctly remember buying Slimer that day) and a random NES game that my sister and I could play together. I lived in a bad neighborhood back then. So I had to stuff everything in my backpack and ride home super fast on my bike so no one could stop me and take my toys. I think I also bought Pizza Hut for my family that day after getting back home (plain cheese pizza -  Kevin McCallister master race!) |-|

|-| cnvamxz || 31 || While I'd like to think that I could find a way to recover from almost anything, there are definitely a few ways that someone could destroy *my* life.

Let's suppose, for example, that my unknown aggressor was in some way tied to an organization with access to some *incredibly* advanced technology. Having decided that they were going to use it - for some reason - to ruin my life, they had this mystery person abduct me, sedate me, and then transport me to a secure location where they'd begin outfitting my entire body with specialized implants. These implants (which were created and maintained via a complex network of nanorobotic components) would only take a few seconds to integrate themselves into my physical form, on account of how remarkably futuristic they were.

When the procedure was complete, I'd discover that I'd have become functionally immortal and gifted with a number of superhero-like abilities.

Now, upon being told this, I'd *think* that my life had suddenly taken a turn for the better... or at the very least, that it had become more interesting. What I wouldn't know, though, would be that in the few minutes that followed my operation, yet another unknown entity would have hacked into the the implants, allowing them to take complete control of my actions. Suddenly, I'd find myself being forced to break into the White House and approach the president.

"Mister Obama," I'd hear myself saying, "I have been sent here by a clandestine consortium with one task to complete." Before the Secret Service could stop me, I would grab our commander-in-chief, drag him to the presidential "throne room," and give him the most patriotic swirlie in the history of our nation.

Less than fifteen minutes would have passed from the time of my abduction... and I would have become an invulnerable fugitive with no free will. As punishment for my crimes, I would be forced to become a regular on "The View," where I would be find myself offering up ideas and thoughts that were completely counter to both my own opinions and the standards of common sense.

As the hour mark approached, the entity controlling me would force me to strip naked, declare my love for Rosie O'Donnell, and then spontaneously explode on national television.

That my little brother's car accident was a suicide. 

My teenage brother had been struggling with OCD and social anxiety for awhile. It was something all of our siblings had dealt with growing up, but it was especially hard on him since the rest of us had moved away from our hometown years ago. Everyone wondered how it could have happened, and they just assumed that he was skipping class since he hated going to school. But I was the one who found the letter after his funeral, and instead of showing it to anyone I just got rid of it and covered up all the evidence (think search history of "fatal car crashes")

The reason I didn't show them is because my dad used to be an alcoholic when we were much younger. The only reason he stopped drinking is because my mother threatened to divorce him and take us away, and he's been sober for almost 15 years now because of it. Also, at the time my mother was fighting stage II breast cancer, and was bedridden and ill with chemo during everything. My father was very attached to our youngest sibling, and they were devastated enough that I had to stay with them for several weeks after to make sure they would be fine. The possibility that my father could have been driven back to drinking, and potentially destroy my family further made my choice for me. No one knows but me and my therapist, and no one else will ever know. I made this decision for them, and I've accepted that its something I will have to carry for the rest of my life. It still hurts sometimes though. |-|

I spoiled the surprise of my birthday gift when I turned 16.  I REALLY wanted a PSP so whenever my mom would ask for gift ideas, that's all I would bring up.  It was always done politely in that I never just randomly asked for it.  It was always when prompted with the question of what I wanted.  She always said that we couldn't afford it which I understood completely.

Two days before my birthday I went to the garage to grab something and then had the idea to poke around to see if I could find my birthday gift.  In a tub under a ton of blankets was the prize: a PSP.  I was stoked, but then realized that it won't be a surprise anymore.  When the day came I pulled out my inner George Clooney and (probably) successfully made them believe it was a complete surprise.  I thanked them profusely because it really was probably more than we could have afforded at the time since my dad was at his old job. 

My parents are awesome and I don't want them to know that I ruined the surprise.  They probably wouldn't care, but it's not something they need to know. |-|

They were doing one of those movie promotions (I think for Spider-man 2) where if you order certain sizes, your drink/fries came with stickers that had a chance of winning a prize, most of the time it was free food. On one of our late night trips we met a disgruntled employee that really didn't like his job and admitted he was quitting soon. Being the greedy teenagers we were, we asked if that meant he would give us a stack of king size fry containers and to our surprise he did!

Spent some time  going through our "loot" that night and discovered we won a shitload of breakfast items and decided to go back for breakfast and cash in (4 or 5 of us total). We checked and couldn't find any rule about how many you could use at one time and neither could the cashier at the time (different person from the night before) and she wasn't told any different, so she was going to allow it.

In comes the fun-ruining manager who tells us we can't do that. Of course we question him and ask him to show us where it says we couldn't do that and he refused and told us to leave. Before leaving we ask for a number to call and file a complaint and he insisted he was the owner of the franchise and all numbers lead to his cell phone anyway and he can get away with whatever he wants "even if that means spitting in your food". I found a 1-800 # on a receipt or something and told him I would try anyway. He told us to leave again and never come back, but followed us to the parking lot and wrote down my license plate # as we drive away.

The next day I get a visit from a local police officer informing me I have to go to the station and sign some papers agreeing to never go back. I signed, they gave me a copy, and I proudly taped it to my bedroom door for all my friends to see. Yes, I still go to that Burger King and that manager wasn't there for long. |-|

|-| cnvb95k || 3 || A Sephora store inside a mall. I was about 19 and with a friend trying to find the eyeliner I wanted. As we were crouched down looking at the ones on the bottom shelf an employee came over and asked if we needed any help. I told him we were ok, I was trying to decide which one I wanted as my first choice wasn't in stock. We spent maybe ten minutes looking at them because I'm a very undecided person. He came around again asking if we need help, I told him I was still trying to decide and we were doing ok. He then started telling me to "just pick one, it doesn't matter" and that we looked like "a couple of strung out drug addicts". This set me off considering I had just gotten out of rehab about 2 weeks earlier. After spending time in treatment trying to better myself this guy had the nerve to say something like this? I then flipped my shit, telling him he had no right to say shit like that me or anyone for that matter. I will say I got pretty heated and yelled some pretty nasty things at him (he was quite clearly a gay man, I made it a point to harass him over that, which today I am very much not proud of). The manager then kicked me out of the store and I was told not to come back ever or the cops would be called. To this day I refuse to shop at any of their stores.  |-|

|-| cnvbg5n || 5 || Not added, but I think we could do a LOT better for sex education. I remember in my school, my teacher (when all the boys left to do their separate education... for some reason?) explained how boys masturbate and where sperm comes from etc etc. But then a classmate asked how girls do it and the teacher got very uncomfortable and mumbled something like, "You should ask your parents."

Seriously? You're being paid to teach teenagers about their bodies (something they desperately need!) but you can't even explain something as simple as "Rub your clitoris or insert something CAREFULLY inside of you. If it's uncomfortable, stop, and just rub your clitoris." Aghh, it drives me insane thinking about it.

When it was over, boys had no idea what a labia was, and girls felt like they hadn't learned anything at all except the names of the different parts of the penis.  |-|

His mother was near suicidal herself after that, and the assistant principal that had suspended him was so wracked with guilt that she resigned not long after. Of course it wasn't either of their faults, but understandable that they were upset. |-|

We were on a quarter system, and by the middle of the 1st quarter, w all my classes being 2d design, film editing, a really really shitty intro programming course, and other crap i hated, i knew i wanted to xfer into a normal CS degree. 

I was mentally checked out the second i got the ok to xfer programs (it was easier since i had programming experience and the media program was part of the computing program anyway) and started finding teachers to figure out what i'd be behind on and what i'd need to do to catch up on that 1st 10 weeks. 

Well, when we got BACK to start the winter quarter, in the middle of some halo 1 LANnin'g on og xboxes, a fucking STATE TROOPER shows up to my dorm room, asking to see ME. I had no clue wtf i was in trouble for (i was the lamest of little nerds, never did anything wrong) and then it hit me.

Remember how i said i had a film class that i had mentally checked out of? There was a final project we had to film, and we were instructed to use these fairly expensive HD sony digital camcorders (think 5,000 dollar prosumer devices) to do it. 

Yeah. it was sitting under my desk in my dorm room the entire break. I'd turned in the edited project, didn't even go to the last week's class (teacher knew i was xfering out and said 'you're fine') and i forgot ALL ABOUT this thing i had to return. 

So half my dorm floor escorted me to the other side of campus, to return the 'stolen' expensive as fuck camera, where the full time employee who was in charge of millions of dollars of camera equipment proceeded to chew me out and say how i was fucked because i was banned for life and i'd never be able to complete any of my assignments and how i'd better just pack up and quit now, and when he was done i just said 'dude i already transferred to CS, can i leave now?'.

A bunch of my friends were still photo kids, so i'd hang out around there all the time, but he couldnt ever do anything about it because i wasn't ever trying to rent equipment.   |-|

They had a large ceremony in the school auditorium to remeber her. People were crying and extremely upset, everyone was suddenly her best friend. About a week or two after that, a boy in senior year was playing Russian roulette and shot himself in the head. He wasn't well liked and at his memorial service people were making fun of him. His family didn't have enough money for a funeral, so the school had a funds drive for it. That was in rural ohio.

After I moved to Australia and completed my high school here, we had one person in the year above me overdose on ecstasy at a club. |-| 
|-| cnvbx59 || 20 || When I was 15, my dad took my sister and I on a trip to Florida to go visit all the big amusement parks. My dad trained us young to love adventure, and we often didn't book much ahead of time when we travelled - we'd figure it out when we got there. Well, we landed about 24hrs after a hurricane and all the hotels were fully booked because so many people had lost power. After hours of driving around, we finally found a hotel with a room with two beds, a pool and it was close enough to the parks. To make a long story short, we met a 21 y/o australian guy travelling alone, and I guess my dad thought he might like some company, so he invited him to several outings with us (parks, dinners, fireworks, etc.). This guy totally won my dad over and therefore, my sister and I by default. One morning, I went knocking on his door to make sure he was up and that he'd be ready to leave in 20 minutes. I'll skip the details, because I can't bring myself to type them out, but he made some rather aggressive advances and essentialy molested me. I didn't know right away... I thought maybe that's how people flirted. I thought maybe that was "normal" 21 y/o male behaviour? But something inside me knew that what had just happened wasn't right. Anyways, I'm now almost 26. My parents still don't know. I was afraid that if I told my mom, she would be so angry at my dad and not let us go on adventures alone with him anymore. I was afraid if I told my dad, he wouldn't know what to say and be angry at himself. At this point, it's probably too late to tell them, and I don't know that I want to. If they knew, they'd probably be really sad. They'd probably be upset that I didn't tell them, and they'd probably try to offer me some help (kind of ironic, since I'm a psychotherapist now). Knowing that their reaction would a supportive, loving one is possibly why I don't bother to tell them, because I feel secure about their love. My little sister had the australian guy on facebook up until about a year ago. She said she deleted him because he gives her a "creepy vibe". I don't blame her.  |-|

My boyfriend and three of his friends died in a separate drunk driving accident.  

A friend's dad died of a heart attack over Christmas Break (a different year than poor Paul).  Funny Story:  Sherry, the girl whose dad died was out of school for an extra month following her dad's death.  A few weeks after she came back we were in History class together when she tapped me on the shoulder and said, "Watch this."

She turned to another boy, and said, "Ohmygod!  I took the car out last night and we got soooo wasted, I ran into the back of a station wagon!  My car is totally wrecked!"

The boy said, "Holy shit!  What did your dad say?!"

She said, "Nothing!  He's dead!" and laughed like a loon.  It was pretty awkward. |-| 
|-| cnvc2vq || 9 || I was expelled from 2 separate military high schools and was told I was "banned for life" from entering either property.  

1st one : smoking pot


2nd one : accumulating too many penalty tours. 1 penalty tour = 30 minutes marching around an outdoor squared area carrying a rifle. The firing pin was removed and the barrel was filled with lead. You'd spend 8 hours on both Saturday and Sunday marching until they were done. I'd racked up enough to keep me marching into the next school year, so they decided to cut ties with me. 

Both locations are at minimum a couple states away and in small towns, so I haven't been back since I left. I've thought about what it would be like, but I'm 30+ now and it would be a little weird sneaking into a HS at this age.  |-|

Worked next to a 36-year-old guy who had started when he was 18, and who never tired of telling me that he was 7 years away from retiring with a pension -- at age 43 -- from a part-time job.

|-| cnvcajv || 7 || My high school had this drunk driving awareness program called "Every Fifteen Minutes." The premise of this program was based around the statistic that every 15 minutes, some teenager is killed by intoxicated driving, so for one school day, they would call a preselected kid (almost always one of the associated student body kids) out of class and pretend that they died. There'd also be talks from cops and parents about drunk driving and shit.

I was rather shocked at what they did to me after I had an abnormal pap smear.

She says to me, "I can tell they used a kevorkian...it's like little shark teeth". You're in stirrups looking up at the ceiling so you don't know it, but getting a biopsy taken involves sticking a long instrument in you with a sharp little shark mouth on the edge that pinches a little part of your cervix off. Then, when it comes back bad, they go up and slice a big "ice cream scoop" of your cervix off. I googled pictures afterwards, and I cried.  |-|

I took a cookie and walked around in the store for a bit. Then I took one more and they threw me out for sponging.
I don't know if they will allow me to come now as it was over a year ago, but I am not going to buy anything from that store. |-|

Well, after some intense thinking about it, and trying to figure out why there are so many different religions, if God is so perfect wouldn't he prevent that from happening? 

It doesn't necessarily mean I am not spiritual, but I am more humanistic than anything else. If there is a God, cool. Hopefully God'll be like, "Yo, bbhatti, you have been a pretty good person, and tried to be as nice as you can to others! Come join me in heaven." If there is no God and no heaven, I know that me being nice to people will leave a good memory of me when I am gone.

The hours are rough, but it seems like they make it fun while they're there, and save a ton of money. It may not be perfect, you basically fall of the map for a couple of months, but to work like that then have money to live your life for 2/3 of the year easily...

They also constantly take out their frustrations with each other on me, then blame me for it.

They complain about everything. I'm fucking tired of them.

As a woman, I don't want to be represented by these entitled, misinformed, circlejerks who think every little thing in the world is out to get them.

I wish these people would do their fucking research about the statistics they pull out of their asses about wage gaps, assault, employment rates. If they did, they'd realize the wage gap doesn't exist, men top the list for homicide/suicide/assault rates, and women are dominating the work force while the percentage of men is dwindling. And their go-to statistic about 1 in 5 women being sexually assaulted? The survey was done incorrectly, with too small a number of participants, the question was misleading, and their answers were manipulated through context and still used, even though many of the women interviewed for the study redacted their answer or said they were misinterpreted.

They sit here and cry victim about every little fucking thing and don't want to be held responsible for anything. They don't want equality; they want to be catered to. If they wanted equality, they'd have no problems protesting to be drafted into the military just as men do,  and no problems fulfilling requirements for physical/service oriented jobs such as police work and firefighting at the same performance level as men (I am not gonna fucking trust a female firefighter with my life knowing a bunch of feminists cried "boo hoo" and got the physical requirement test lowered for them. If you wanna save lives, go be a nurse or a doctor."). But all they wanna do is complain about how women are the victims of war because they lose their sons and fathers, about how they're not appreciated in the office workforce because there aren't many female CEO's.

Then they wanna cry about being oppressed and not having the same advantages as men do. Bitches. You aren't oppressed. You aren't "victims of society". You just want to do whatever you want without thinking logically about what will happen, or what consequences you'll have to face. 

*"Don't slut-shame me. I wear what I want".*
"Oh, but look at her. She's barely wearing anything. She's made herself a sexual object and doesn't respect herself." 
*"You should love me for me, even if I'm fat and lazy. My personality matters more than looks. HEALTH AT EVERY SIZE."*
"Ew. I would never date a fat guy. They're gross and I deserve better than that. And look at her! She's oppressing me because she's thin, eats healthy and likes to work out. You're triggering me by being thin when I'm not! Men like curves. She's succumbed to the pressures of the patriarchy and isn't a twue feminist."
*"Women should be treated like human beings. Why would you hit a woman? Or yell nasty things at her because she wants to express herself? Because she's a woman?"*
"Fuck men! They're all born privileged and have NO right to an opinion. Men are scum! We should rid the world of men!"

I fucking hate feminism and feminists. I don't care if "not all feminists are like that". If you identify with that group, but you aren't a brat/batshit crazy, you should find another name to identify yourself with. |-|

I didn't know about this roller coaster she was until it was far too late, by the time we separated and sought counseling she was already checked out and (unintentionally) gave me a dose of my own medicine by not being responsive to communication and intimacy, or receptive to spending quality time together.

|-| cnvd81i || 3 || The second most disturbing thing I've woken up to was being upside down in a sleeping bag. It took around 20-30 seconds of frantic struggling before I realized what was was going on. I then pulled myself out, put myself back in the right direction, and went back to sleep.

This was during a winter survival camp out with the boy scouts. No tents, and snow on the ground. It was a cold bitch. |-| 
|-| cnvd881 || 29 || My mom HATED my high school boyfriend.  Actually, nothing personally against him it was his dad she hated because he was her bosses friend and she HATED her boss (rightfully so, he was a dick). Anyways I was not allowed to go to his Jr Prom with him because I was 15 and I wasn't allowed to go on dates until I was 16.  He and I discussed this and he took one of our friends as his date.  I was totally fine with this but my mom made me feel like a pile of shit and taunted me all night about how he was out with her and they were probably making out or having sex (they weren't).  

Anyways fast forward to the age of 18, I have graduated high school, I am attending community college, I don't live with my parents, I am working full time and I have the same boyfriend (we'll call him Ted).  Ted is in the Navy now and is stationed in Spain, we only get to talk on the phone a couple times a week because his dad is nice enough to let me use a calling card on his phone plan.  Ted is planning a trip home for Christmas and I am super excited to see him.  I worked late one night and closed the store where my mom and I both worked.  I ran to gas station and over to a friends house before going home for the evening.  In the morning I am woken up by my cousin asking why is my friend Joe's truck parked in front of the store.  My cousin was on the phone with my mom who had called to my home to ask if I was home in my own bed, which clearly I was and I had no fucking clue why Joe's truck is parked in front of the store.  My cousin gets off the phone with my mom and I kind of brush it off and my mom being a mom and go on with my day.  Little did I know that my mom was actually calling from Ted's fathers house because she told Ted's father that I was sleeping with Joe (since his truck was parked in front of the store and I was the one that closed the store the night before right? I must be fucking him) and my mom and Ted's father have already called Ted in Spain to break the news to him.  

I did not find out what had happened to mine and Ted's relationship until YEARS later.   When Ted came home for Christmas that year we spoke and broke up because he thought I had cheated on him, he actually got slapped in the face because he suggested we not see each other while he was home and try to work it out in fear that I would get preggo to "save the relationship" which I am more than sure was a thought my mom put into Ted's head during their little conversation but I didn't know about that conversation.  I was more than pissed at this point making not talking very easy because I thought he knew me better than to even suggest that I, an 18 year old living on their own, paying for college and working full time would be dumb enough to think a baby would "save a relationship" also for not believing me I didn't cheat on him - I didn't even know why anyone would even say such a thing! 

Ted and I are still friends, he was the one that finally told me 4-5 years later that my mom is the one that told him and his dad I cheated on him with Joe and that she had actually called from him dad's house to tell him that morning I was questioned.  I had no fucking idea, at this point I was married to a terrible verbally and mentally abusive man and I was so fucking pissed at my mom.  Never have I ever told her that I know she is the one that called Ted and ruined what could have been a very good relationship because she didn't want to let me go so young.  Yes, we were young but we both knew what we wanted from life.  Ted went on to get married and then divorced, I divorced the douche in 2008 and recently remarried an amazingly great guy.  Ted and I are still friends and we keep in touch on Facebook and such.  I guess in the end alls well that ends well but if I learned anything is that I won't treat my children the way my parents treated me.  

TL:DR Mom lied and said I was cheating, didn't find out til years later, vow to never treat my children how I was treated. |-|

And I owe it in many ways to that first computer I learned to build back up from scratch and make my own.

One kid found a bunch of chemicals in the back of the house and poured them all over the floor. Guess they didn't mix well together and started a fire. Burned the whole house down. Everyone got in trouble but me. I stuck with the story that I wasn't there despite another kid ratting out that I was. Then everyone said I was there, my parents asked me several times to tell them the truth and I lied everyone of them.

They got me a lawyer and I refused to plead and went to juvenile court and got off. My story was that the other kids didn't like me and were trying to get me in trouble. It helped that I was suspended from school for fighting one of them twice so it sort of looked like I was telling the truth to people who didn't know us. One of those fights was because he ate my french fries and the other was he tore a page out of my Final Fantasy Tactics guide. We pretty much just got in fights for the hell of it and made up like right after. It was the word of 4 others against me and I was the only one who got away with it. The others got probation and one went to a detention center for a few months.

If they found out I lied then they probably wouldn't be happy with me after all the money they spent on legal fees.

Oh I'd like to add that this was done the day before Valentines day and no one was even questioned until late March. It was because someone ran their mouth and word spread. I didn't even get questioned until May. I figured they had nothing on me but their word against mine. Even if I was found guilty then I don't think my parents would have believed I did it. My court case kept getting granted a continuance for almost a year. I even agreed to a polygraph which they never gave me. I would get freaked out at school when I saw the police liaison officer in the hall thinking that he was finally coming to take me in. |-|

|-| cnvdd65 || 11 || The time me and my girlfriend stopped as ex-felon, druggy and thief, from breaking in my parents’ house and stealing a bag filled with stolen property and drugs he had stashed in our house the previous night.


So, one holiday weekend, my parents decided to go on a 4-day vacation.  My older sister was still living with them, so she alone was watching the house while they were out of town. She decided to take advantage of is by bring back home a guy that she meets at a party on a Friday night.


Next morning on Saturday, the guy abruptly tells her that he needs to leave, but that he would be back later that night, and that he was going to leave a backpack he had brought with him. My sister was fine with it, but that she wouldn’t be home during a certain time because she had an appointment had to go to. She says goodbye to him, and he goes on his way.

 
A couple hours later, she gets a rage filled call from the women who had hosted the party the previous night. She calms that my sister and that guy had been gone through the house and stolen all her jewelry, cash, pills bottles, and check books, and that she was calling to cops on my sister. My sister ask her what the hell she’s talking about, the women on the phone explains that the guy she was with is a known ex-felon who people at the party said they saw going through drawers. While on the phone, my sister open up the bag the guy had left and finds that it's filled with all the stolen items the women had mentioned, as well as a few other peoples wallets, as well as dozens of needles and pill bottles.  After seeing this, my sister starts panicking and tells the women about everything that is in the bag. As soon the women hears this, she says "Wait, there are drugs in the in the bag? Okay, I'm not going to call the police. You're going to give me your address and I'm going to pick up the bag." My sister hangs up on her and decides to text the guy she met last night to call her and tell her what happened. He calls her, comes up with some excuse as to why the bag is filled with stolen stuff, and says he will be heading back later to get the bag.  She tells him not to come over until she can figure out what is going. She also starts ignoring all the phone calls and texts the woman sends her for the next hour. She ignores them, until the women sends her a text with our parents’ house address, saying she now knows where we live and she will be over later that night for the bag.


Now, my sister starts having a panic attack, texts me and my girlfriend, and tells me that she's in trouble and she needs me to come over right away.  When we get there, she shows us the bag, and fills us in on of what happened. (She doesn't mention that the woman knows our address and said she would come over, or that the guy was a felon and that he said he would come back). I figure she called me because she wants me to help her out of the situation with both parties wanting the bag, so I immediately told her, "Look, this isn't our problem and it doesn't have to be your. Don't get involved. Just call the police, give them the bag with the stolen property, and stay the fuck away from those people." She starts crying and says she doesn't want to police to get involved because she doesn't want my parents to find out, that she can figure out the situation, and she just called us to ask us to watch the house for about an hour and a half, because she had some appointment she had to go to and couldn't get out of.
Since I didn't know the whole story, I decided to watch the place for her while she was gone and that when she gets back, I would get the truth out of my sister regarding what actually happened.  


About 30 minutes after she leaves, she calls me and tells me that the guy she was with called her back and told her that he is going to get that bag back tonight, even though she told him to stay away.  I asked her “what the hell does that mean?” and she says that she doesn’t know.  I tell her I’m calling the cops, and she once again begs and pleads with me until I agree to wait for her to get back home.  Me and my girlfriend double check the locks, and start trying to figure out if that was just a threat, or if someone’s actually going to try to break into the house, and what is actually going on tonight.  I’m now starting to get on edge because of how shady this whole situation is, so I decide to go to my gun safe and take out a shotgun and handgun on the off chance I might need them.
 
About 15 minutes later, my girlfriend and I start to hear noises coming from outside the back of house, then the side of the house, then finally the side door of the garage. Within 30 seconds, the side garage doors start shaking as someone tries to force their way in.  I immediately grab the shotgun, rack, load, and shoulder the shotgun and screams “WHO THE FUCK IS OUT THERE!!!” as loud and as intimidatingly as I can. Door immediately stops shaking and I hear the sounds of running, jumping a fence, bumping into trash cans, and more running. 

At this point, fuck it, I’m done and through with playing around. I call the police and tell them about what happened and about the bag. They tell me since the person is no longer actively trying to break in, it’s not an emergency so they will send a squad car out to pick up the bag whenever it has time.  I then call my sister, tell her what happened, and let her know I want to have a nice chat once she gets back to the house. 

Once she gets back, she fills me in on the whole story.  We decided to stay with my sister until the police arrived so we can give our statements.  It took the police three and half hours to arrive. During this time spent waiting, both the ex-felon and the women who threw the party keep texting my sister, trying to get her to give each of them the bag. My sister texts them, tells them that she’s freaking out because they each want the bag and someone tried to break in, and that her she is giving the bag to the police and not to contact her anymore.  A little while after this, she gets a the same text from both the guy, and the women, saying that they contacted each other, and that both of them will be heading over together to sort the situation out and get back the bag.  While the party took place in a city that was about a 60 minute drive away from my parent’s house, they were now apparently sitting together in a parking lot about a mile from the house and are trying to talk my sister into letting them come over to pick up the bag. 

She tells me about this new development, to which I respond “Why the fuck are you still talking to them! Give me your phone!” She asks if we should let them come over to pick up the bag, to which I bluntly point out that beside that fact that we already told the police about that bag and that someone already tried to break in, the bag also contained the stole property of other people who hadn’t been harassing us all night.

When the police finally arrive, we give them the bag and recap all the events of what happened.  They go through the bag, find the drugs and stolen property, give us a lecture about how we seem like good people, and how my sister should not hang around those sort of people, as they have seen to many people here age get involved with crime and end up in jail. The officers contact the women by phone and tell her they found her stolen property.  The woman claims my sister stole the property, and that she had been trying to get her to give in back all night. The officer starts asking her if she is nearby so they can return the property, and she tells them she is currently parked in a parking lot a mile away from our house, sitting in the car with who she claims is her son-in-law. The officers just look at each other, tell her over the phone they understand, that she needs to stay put, and that they are going drive to them and bring them back their stolen property. The officers then takes the bag, tell us to be extra vigilant for the next couple of weeks in case someone comes back to retaliate, and then left saying they were going to meet the women and man in the parking lot.

And that’s it. That’s the story. We never heard back from the police, the lady, or the guy again. This happened several years ago, so I don’t think we will ever know what happened. My sister wisely decided to stay away from those people and that circle of friends from then on.

When my parents got back from vacation, I warned them that a few of the houses around us got broken into during the weekend, and that the police came by to warn us to stay safe and watch our house for the next few weeks in case someone tried to break in. When my mom heard this, she had to sit down and said she felt like she was going to have heart attack just from hearing of how a house several blocks away from us had a break in. She then started to go on a rant about how we needed an alarm system, better locks, stronger doors,  need to leave the lights on at night, need to leave the tv on at all times, ect… 

My dad thanked me for the warning and he would be careful about locking the house, but also let me know he was a bit peeved at me for unnecessary upsetting my mom.

**TL;DR:  Sister bring ex-felon back to house, ex-felon stashes stolen goods at house along with drugs, another shady character finds out about  the bag and wants if for herself, I use a gun to scare of someone who tries to break into the house, police get involved, my dad get mad at me for unnecessary scaring my mom.**

I never felt so judged and mistreated in my life. I went there for the medicine my doctor prescribed and because the pharmacist had political views she used the fact that I wasn't in my hometown against me as proof I was trying to con the sites for dope.

He sells various drugs and got busted being obvious about it, hence the ban. Not to be deterred, he loiters on the fringes of the parking lot and such to continue his business. His name is Brother Paul (changed but close enough to get the idea) and he very distinctive looking with masses of reeking dreads. Anyway one Halloween he's up there, we're all having a good time, he wants to come in the bar. Sends a spokesperson in to butter up the bartender who is having none of it.  About an hour or so later, the place is packed, everyone is dancing to the band in their costumes and I see Brother Paul sauntering in all nonchalant like in his disguise/costume which consists of a garbage bag and duct tape outfit complete with a plastic grocery bag over his head. No mouth or eye holes, smelly bleached dreads sprouting out the back.  He looked like the garbage bag gimp predator.  The bartender was laughing so hard she could barely order him out.

|-| cnvdiqv || 13 || Got banned from a minecraft server for rejecting a girl who was pretending to be a guy and hitting on me (I'm a straight guy). Turns out she was a good friend of the staff and threw a hissy fit telling them I was being homophobic and bigoted. 

Got unbanned, then got banned again because I took a kids house off my property that was claimed as mine, then when the server rolled back the damage it covered my friends (underground) house in dirt, somehow was blamed for that.

The final final ban was me being given a temporary semi-staff position and telling this bitchy 12 year old girl to stop her rant about how stupid one of my friends was. In retrospect, I shouldn't have pulled a bluff saying I could ban her. She was a real jerk, though. I got banned for this and she was pampered like she was abused.

I got scolded on a server that I had much better standings on because one douchey kid teleported to my town and killed me the second I stepped out of it. Turns out he was "hunting", a practice where he would check the dynamic map to check when people would walk out of town limits, teleport to the town, ten use an invisibility potion to sneak up and kill people to take their stuff. Key bit here, I had a very valuable sword I made in creative, which I wasn't supposed to have In survival. The staff didn't really know or care, and most of them are my friends. So long as I didn't use it as an advantage over other players they didn't care. Problem is, douche-boy wouldn't give the sword back, after multiple times of telling him it's not legal in survival. I talked to the staff, and then one of them (younger brother of the owner) comes on and tells the kid he's done with it (douche-boy was a repeat offender). What he didn't think of, is that he wasn't staff anymore after resigning. Eventually, I take the sword from the kids inventory using op commands (had op for building stuff, didn't think of using it to take the sword back, and the kid put the sword in one of his chests). The kid acts like he's been victimized, then goes and posts a ban request to try and get me banned. I had posted a ban request before he did. In the end, though, neither of us got in trouble. Why? Because apparently me having that cheat sword (for killing mobs and animals that jumped all over my builds, only used while I was in creative) cancelled out his multiple offenses of murder and thievery. Yeah, I question the staff of that server sometimes. They're good people. Shame that server closed down. R.I.P. Mountain Pass. 2012-2014. :( |-|

Of course he treated the girls like shit and dealt coke and got laid way more than the rest of us barely post-pubescent wienies.  Other than his posse of hanger-ons we all hated that fucker.

Here in the desert southwest we get summer storms that come up quick and can be pretty violent. So there Mister Danger Is My Middle Name is fishing by the side of the lake when a bolt of lightning drills throught the top of his cranium and removes most of it without hurting the girl.

We had the bots set up so that one guy could play the game live, and the other 10 people behind him would just aromatically attack anything he hit. 

Well, of course we got reported. GM appears with an in-game character, and accuses us of botting. My brother in law was the one playing at the time, and tries to engage the GM in a conversation to "prove" he was not botting. The GM walks up and smacks my brother in law's character.

The day before he committed suicide, he finished the last item on his bucket list. Everyone was so confused as to why he did that when he had so much to live for, blah blah blah. I know depression and suicidal tendencies. My theory of what happened is that sometime and the time the movie The Bucket List(2006ish) came out, he told someone about his depression and sucididal thoughts. The obvious answer? Create a bucket list, that way you can't kill yourself until you do everything you want to do. Whoever gave him that advice probably thought he'd get over his depression by then, or just not be able to finish the list so soon. But that kid made his bucket list, completed it and decided his time was done.  |-|

She was riding w/ her bf and came up to this curve which is basically a 90 degree curve, and they hit it going way to fast and the car rolled and killed her.  The bf (driver) was ok.  She was usually always in my  homeroom class, since we both had the last name begin w/ a "W", but I never really got to know her on a personal level.  Sure we hung out w/ the same group but we never had too many 1 on 1 conversations.  The biggest memory I have of her is when we were in spanish class and were taking a test.  She was sitting right behind me and kept asking me for the answers on the test, and I naturally helped her out.  The teacher caught us and I had to sit next to the teacher, which worked out since she had the answers on her desk and I got to look at them.  Tiffany, I hope you are doing well in the next life after your crash and you were an awesome person!  Just wish I would of gotten to know you a little bit better.  


This girl in school was a grade above me and she committed suicide b/c her bf broke up w/ her.  Her sister was in the grade below me w/ my brother.  That was another tragic loss, as she went too soon.   |-|

We were in college though so it was easy to write off the alcohol abuse. Once we were married and moved away from college, it became quickly apparent that his problem was much worse than the average heavy drinker. Some gambling debt started to become an issue and we were fighting all the time. Part of the problem was that I don't know how to help someone with addictive behavior.  I don't understand it, but I didnt want to be the kind of wife who left her mentally ill husband. Then one night I took his keys when he came home drunk. He backed me into a wall and said "do you want to make this a domestic situation". That was the trigger for me to end it. I said to myself, "is this really the life you want". That was a sentence I should have said before we got married. It lasted 6 months. His mother blamed me for going back on my vows.  Maybe she was right. I did go back on them, but I realized in the moment he threatened me that I didn't love him anymore. I was 24 and miserable. So I kicked him out.

1 guy pulled a Drake and ended up in a wheelchair after getting attacked by someone (I guess it's a thing to show up at parties and either shoot or stab random people) and someone else from the party died

Uhhhhhhhh honestly I think a few more, too

I went to a school of like 4000 kids with a really poorly designed layout. The campus was divided by a busy street with nothing to break up the flow of traffic except for the honor system, so it was pretty normal for people to die crossing the street to get to their car (all of the parking was across the street from the main portion of campus)

I know when my brother went there someone was shot and killed on campus and it became a "closed" campus, but the gates were literally never closed or locked and security would just let us leave if we bothered to ask, so it was pretty normal.

It was also in a very poor area (the high school for the city I actually lived it was supposed to be built in 2001 and it literally did not open until 2011 or something because of shitty city officials).

The year after I graduated the state took over my high school because it was such a cluster fuck, but honestly death wasn't even a big deal to us because we were *so* used to it after the first semester. It's sad. And they still haven't put traffic signals up or stop signs or anything to slow traffic, but whatever.

Edit: Forgot one guy who died of brain cancer; he didn't actually go to my high school because of the cancer but he would have been there if it hadn't become so aggressive. His mom was a really popular teacher at our middle school and he was well known. That was a sad one. |-|

Anyway, I walk into the kitchen at one point, and he is there with this giant wedge of cheese. He looks up and asks if I wanted any. I nod, because I fucking loved cheese. He says "ok, but you cannot tell your parents because you'll ruin your dinner they will get mad at me" and he slices me a few pieces. We eat in silence and then I leave, convinced that I was an accomplice in some terrible act with my ex-con uncle. To this day, I have never told my parents.

Also, when I was 6 my mom had a boyfriend whom I hated and we lived in his house. One day he reallllllly pissed me off, so I cleaned the toilet with his toothbrush with pee still in the toilet. 10 minutes after I did it he came into my room and asked, "did you use my toothbrush?

She hates my wife. Almost had me convinced to leave her, but I couldn't do it. When I went back to my wife, the last thing my mother said to me was, "Don't get her pregnant or she has you trapped forever!"

Doing the math, our child was conceived the very first day I came home. 

We never wanted kids. It was never in our plan. We're both irresponsible and broke as shit, with lots of emotional baggage from growing up in broken homes with criminal parents. We agreed that we'd never put a child through that. 

Due to my wife's build, health conditions, and very irregular cycles, we did not discover she was pregnant until 7.5 months in, far too late to terminate.  In one of the hardest moves of our lives, we placed our child for adoption with an incredible couple who wanted nothing more out of life than to raise a child.

The problem is they are completely unregulated and people never know what they're going to get. They are highly toxic and highly addictive. Psychosis is not an uncommon side effect. More common side effects include massive paranoia, vomiting, hallucinations (not the fun kind), agitation, seizures, muscle tremors, spasms, and suicidal ideation. 

[Here's a story about a batch in Texas](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/07/synthetic-marijuana-overdoses-texas_n_5280792.html?&amp;ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000067) that caused 120 overdoses in 5 days. Those were just reported. 

The withdrawal is apparently violent and terrible and worse than heroin. 

So why do people smoke it? Because it's legal and doesn't show up as weed on a drug test. That's what the fucking war on drugs does. Harm reduction is a model that *needs* to be explored. Fuck Nancy Reagan's bullshit "just say no". These deaths and these drugs are a direct result of the war on drugs. Outlaw a plant that grows freely in the wild, but unregulated chemicals that cause overdose and sometimes death are sold in your local gas station.

So I'm waiting in line and my ring fell off. I pick it up and this woman starts yelling at me "Hey give me back my ring!". Confused I told her that it was my ring that my grandfather gave me.
She made such a scene that the store manager came over and demanded that I give back her ring. The ring itself was a men's ring and had "To, Lawrence, My, Love, Ginny" on five separate bands, plus the caster, the year, and sterling. 

I'm just a confused college kid that has no idea whats going on. I point out that Lawrence and Virginia are my grandparents both of whom had died very recently, so I'm getting really upset. The manager tells me to give her the ring or he'll call the cops. I refuse and tell him to call the cops, by this time I had finished buying my stuff and was in that tight isle that leads from the cashwraps to the exit. The cops shows up and the managers made up this huge story about how I ripped the ring off of her finger and tried to run away with it. She corroborates his story. When I give him my version, he asks my why does my version sound so different than theirs. I told him because I'm not lying. I ask him if they could hold the ring at the station and release it until I can prove that Lawrence and Ginny are my grandparents. He obliged, the store manager and the woman are livid. 

As I'm about to leave the manager grabs my cart and tells me store policy says that I can't take my purchases as they may have been stolen or purchased with stolen money. I have the receipt in my pocket so I just leave it be and go. I call my parent immediately and my mom emails me copies of my grandparent's immigration papers, and her and my birth certificate. In the end the lady never showed up and I claimed my ring back with my proof. I go back the next day to the walmart and the store manager calls the cops for trespassing and tells me I'm banned forever. When I get back to my door I called corporate and got to the bottom it. All my purchases got delivered to my dorm over the course of the next month. I also found out later that the store manger was in cahoots with that woman and bunch of others, scamming people our of valuables and their purchases. Turns out they were Traveling Irishmen.

edit: [Here is a Picture of the ring in question, if anyone is interested.](http://imgur.com/a/l5Ek1) From what I've been told its a common design. grandma got it from up in the Catskills when they had their silver anniversary. |-|

Her ex didn't very much like that and broke in early before school started, killed him with an axe, shot her mother and tortured her for hours (she also went to my school, had art with her though never really talked). She eventually escaped, and her ex then killed himself. |-|

A friend and I walked in with a stereo blasting ["I believe in a thing called love" by The Darkness.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRYNYb30nxU). This thing was on absolute maximum full blast and we started running around the tables with guests trying to enjoy their meals, into the kitchen, all over. We were singing and dancing and going crazy. The staff started trying to capture us and get us out. 

Back then I had long hair and dressed like a skater punk, so it was impossible for anyone to recognize me in later years upon my return (as if anyone from that period still worked there)

If I could go back in time I would probably kick my own ass for being such an annoying little twat.

It's hard work. It's very hard work for a couple years for very little money. The payoff though is nice. Brewer positions are still tough but more money and a little more cushy (you have assistants afterall), and head brewer positions are even better. You will never get rich, but you will have a fun life full of conferences, beer events, beer dinners etc... all paid for by the company.

Plus I think our guys make about 32k a year. not bad. It's a long, tough, and fun career, but if you stick with it, it can be very rewarding. At least I find it rewarding. who doesnt want to make beer? |-|

People treat it like its a God given right to have any piece of content they want. And any producer of content who wants to maximize the return on their (very expensive to produce) content is literally hitler. 

Take for example The Interview, reddit had a shit fit over the fact that they couldnt iTunes the movie on demand outside of USA, completely ignoring the idea that other countries still had a theatrical release planned and releasing it on demand would have breached their contractual agreements overseas and heck, they probably wanted to make some money off a film that was now likely to bomb. 

You can't escape the "movie/tv/music studios are stuck in the past" line that's repeated ad nauseum in every thread, despite the fact that Netflix, spotify, iTunes, Amazon prime, Hulu et al have all existed for many years and provide exactly the service that people want. Studios are stupid/evil Because they won't let you watch a billion dollar movie at home for a couple of bucks on the day of release. 

There are many arguments for and aganst piracy, but on here it's so hard to counter the entitlement of redditors and their ignorance of the realities of the industry. It's a circle jerk of "I only pirate things because I don't have access" or "pirates are the best customers" or "companies are stuck on outdated buisness models" and even as someone who steals almost all his content, it's getting frustrating to read.

|-| cnveqqt || 10 || I went on a cruise for spring break with some friends and my girlfriend. We made stop in Nassau and went ashore for a day trip. We ended up at some nice hotel casino having some drinks, and my girlfriend was getting frisky. We ended up going into the women's bathroom to go at it. We're in the stall, we hear people coming and going and making comments, but not paying much attention. 

Eventually someone starts banging on the stall door (punintentional), which we ignore. It turns out that it was hotel security lady. We didn't respond until I finished. She was furious. She brought us into the hotel security office, took our IDs, and threatened to arrest us. Her partner/coworker/supervisor just smiled and laughed at us, but he seemed cool with it. We ended up getting banned from the casino for life, but no charges pressed against us.

The bigger problem? I don't know what hotel it was. I was too drunk and scared to get the name. So now, if I ever go to a hotel in the Bahamas, there's a 5% chance that they won't let me in, and I won't know until I get there. |-|

Suddenly the train driver came on the intercom. I was sort of half paying attention *shall I listen, shall I go back to sleep...* Suddenly he says **I just want to reassure you that the train is not on fire"** WHAT did he just say? I opened my eyes and glanced out the window. There was thick smoke, you couldn't see a damn thing. Meanwhile the train was still racing along.

Well, it turned out that they'd put something on the tracks, no idea what but it created a hell of a lot of dust that had just been sitting there. We were the first train to come along that day and we kicked up all the dust. I'd never seen anything like it! |-|

Really we couldn't be surprised, smoked a pack a day, just like most of my family.

Everytime I saw him, he was getting worse. We were in and out of the hospital and the bills were piling up, his insurance was fighting us worse than the cancer. The worse day was calling the insurance company, begging them to tell me another way.

Ending the call, I looked at my mother. She was just defeated, we had been down this road twice before.

Finally, some improvement. 

It looked like he was in remission, this was the first good news in almost a year and for a few weeks I could breathe easy.

Dialing the insurance company again, I started to go over our plan. But the bills were well past due, I didn't make enough to care for my out of work parents and my own family. They were ending our coverage.

Devastated,  I gathered my family and told them the news. My mother looked at my father and pulled a handgun.

Yelling, screaming, I asked my mother how much money she would need to pay this off. She looked at me with tears in her eyes and said, "Read the first letter of every paragraph" |-|

I had shotgun blasted the toilet with shit, and I was now sitting in my own shit still letting loose a torrent of shit. After I had finished and wiped I rolled off the toilet and laid in the fetal position for a solid ten minutes. Then I got up, cleaned off the toilet and wall behind it and made sure there was no shit anywhere, and went back to bed. I'm 24 now and have never said a word.

I rented a textbook from them and somehow they fucked up my return date, so I missed my deadline to return it (which was 2 months before my class was over).  I tried to print my return sticker after the class was over and couldn't figure it out, so I called customer service who told me my book was overdue.  They refused to take the book back and charged me $106 to buy the book.  I'm like.. I don't want the book.  Take it back.  They wouldn't.  I told them I wouldn't pay for it, since they got the return date wrong.  They didn't care.  They dicked me around talking to different people for like a month, then I finally just disputed the charges.  BN never responded to the credit card company asking about the charges, so they gave me the money back.

Anyways, probably 2 years later (yes, I hadn't shopped there in that long), I tried to buy something online since someone gave me a gift card. It wasn't going through.  So I called customer service.  Apparently they had locked my account because I was a troublemaker.  The customer service lady apparently didn't give a fuck and unlocked my account. So it all worked out I suppose. |-|

About 75 people come and go and we still don't have a table. Shit hit the fan. They called the cops. My brother-in-law followed some asshole who complained about the noise we were making back to his table and harassed him while he's trying to eat, asking how patient he'd be after waiting 3 fucking hours while everyone else comes and goes.

No arrests. Enough of us were non-drinkers that we just left, but banned for life.  |-|

|-| cnvgifb || 17 || One day, my parents, my younger brother (who had downsyndrome) and I went to some downsyndrome house where they take in children with downsyndrome. They didn't explain to me what the trip was for, as they knew I couldn't handle it. 

My bro was 5 and I was 7 and we were (still are extremely close). While in the house, my parents were talking to the keepers of the house, while my brother and I went to the room with the downsyndrome children. I overheard my mom saying 'are you there any schools for children with special needs in this area?' Immediately everything clicked. 

And as expected I couldn't control myself. I was throwing baseball with some chubby downsyndrome child and he threw the basketball to me and I just held it. Looked in his face and he was smiling. I looked at my brother and saw an expression of unease. He didn't feel confortable for probably a reason. I got so pissed off. I felt like the chubby downsyndrome was laughing because of what my mom just said. He was laughing at me and going to take my brother away. 

I thew the baseball with all strength right in the chubby boy's face. His whole mouth was bleeding as was his nose. Intuïtively before the boy even started crying I screamed 'no Nino (my brother's name)'. 
And the boy started screaming even louders. He was in shock.

My parents came in together with the keepers. I told them 'it's crazy papa, mama! I told Nino he's going to live here and he just threw the ball in this boy's face!'

My parents apologized and we left the place. In the car they asked my brother why he threw the ball, but my brother just angrily didn't answer. As if he knew what I wanted. 

And today he is turning 19! He still lives at home, but he has a job, is almost independent, and the joy of all our lifes. :)

|-| cnvgkjw || 24 || One of my best friends died the summer before my senior year. He just dropped dead. Little brother and best friend found him on the floor of his bedroom.

He had a reputation for dabbling in drugs, and admittedly he used weed, shrooms, and acid a couple times. But I knew he had finally knocked it off. A lot of people didn't and rumors flew he had OD'd. I had people telling me he didn't deserve a school memorial because he overdosed. 

Almost eight years later and it's still painful. 

But i did have some closure and victory the day his mother called to tell me his toxicology report was completely clean. And she told me the medical examiner have her countless apologies for not being able to determine why he died. Told his mom that it kept her up at night because she couldn't figure out exactly why this 16 year old boy just fell over and died. It was really fucking hard to move on without knowing why. 

I miss him. I miss his voice, his laugh, his music, his weird sense of humor. I still have dreams about him from time to time. It's funny how grief can lie dormant for so long and suddenly a song comes on the radio and I'm crying like it was yesterday. I'm lucky to still talk to his family multiple times a year. Their strength is what helped me heal. 

But god damn, I miss you man. |-|

During my first semester of college a guy from one of my classes started following me around. Eventually he moved on to inappropriate touching and threats so two sexual harassment charges later I had a restraining order slapped on to him with the help of my parents. I thought that had stopped him following me and stuff but actually he just got better at hiding and one night when my roommate left to take a shower, which she always did at two or three in the morning, she left the door unlocked and he was able to get in and was trying to get freaky with me while I was asleep. I ended up breaking his nose and screamed my head off until everyone in the entire dorm was woken up. He has now been officially kicked out of the college and moved back in with his parents on the other side of the country.

TL;DR: Stalker tried to get freaky with me in sleep, instead got a broken nose. |-|

I was sleeping in bed with my mom because it storming out real bad and my dad was in Florida. Apparently my aunt, whom was about 14 at the time thought it would be a good idea to go into a chat room and tell some dude where we lived. This creeper ended up coming to our house and trying to get in, saying my moms name repeatedly. Then the storm got more violent and the tornado sirens went off. We all had to rush to the basement, meanwhile my mom was calling 911 telling them some strange man was outside of our house. The cops came and seen what looked like a mans boot print in the mud outside my moms window.
We all pretty much almost shit ourselves in fear that he was going to come back and break in after the storm. We all slept with knives under our pillows.
I guess the cops stuck close by, knowing that it was a house full of kids and one female adult with a newborn.  One funny side to the story is my aunt had to shit so bad that she ended up pooping in a bucket we had in the basement. I cried because it smelled so bad, I also had to pee really bad but didn't want to use the poopy bucket. so my brave cousin took me upstairs to pee. Apparently I gave no fucks when my mom said there was a strange man outside our house and possibly a tornado too.

Okay, to start with, I had a sexual relation with my brother. I was about 6 and he was about 10. It started curiously. He learned of masturbation first, being older, and shared it with me. We didn't get along very well, but he needed someone to share and explore, and I was it. It started out with just masturbating which was innocent enough, even though neither of us were even in puberty. We were just getting "dry" orgasms and didn't know anything about sex, just the mechanics of achieving pleasure. Our foreskin hadn't even separated from our dick heads. We eventually got cable and started sneaking into the living room at night and watching "far double digit channels". Our old TV could tune to 99 channels and everything between ~45 and ~70 was just static, but between 70 and 80 we had some 1 or 2 erotica channels and maybe 1 actual porn channel which played after midnight.

Well, things quickly devolved from that. We got into calling pre-recorded automatic sex lines and some were a little more perverted than others. We tried playing out the scenes from the pornos, faking home intruders and submission, thinking sex started with the woman being reluctant and fighting it, then ending up enjoying it. We wore our mother's pantyhose and panties and cross-dress. I was around 8 and my brother was 12 at the time. At the time, though, it was still about some reluctant oral and mutual masturbation.

Me and my brother would still fight a lot, but he did become very friendly when he wanted to try new things or want me to do something which, I realize, was manipulative. Looking back, it still felt like he was leading the way, being older and realizing the situation a lot better.

Meanwhile, I had been experimenting on my own in the toilet with anal stuff. I would finger myself, but found myself losing bowel control whenever I did. However, I found that if I went at it long enough, I would reach some really 'different' forms of ecstasy. This went on for years and my parents ended up being suspicious of the amount of time I was spending in the toilet. On more than a few occasions, I had almost gotten caught with my hand covered in shit from the time I had spent fingering myself.

Anyway, that really fucked me up, hormonally and emotionally. I just didn't feel motivated. I didn't feel compelled to live and have been contemplating suicide since I was around 11. I couldn't even see myself going to high school. I was just thinking of painless ways to commit suicide, but the thought of breaking my parents' hearts was just too much for me and I soldiered on. Suicide was a coward's way out.

Back to me and my brother, the things really escalated when we got Internet when I was about 10 and we found online porn very easily accessible. We tried anal a few times, and I was receptive. It mostly ended with me running to the bathroom to empty my bowels. My brother did give me blowjobs a few times though.

This 'relationship' really started coming to a conclusion when I was 12. My brother moved to a bigger city to start high school and I was left to myself for most of the time. My dad had been coming back with him for the weekends for the better part of 2 years already, but it was putting strain. My dad had gotten a better job in the bigger city, but would come and bring my brother, so the family could still be together for the weekends.

Well, my brother moved on eventually, finding different friends and maybe 'straightening out'. I, however, was left fucked up. I kept getting into more and more perverted shit. I moved to the bigger city myself when I was 14 and lived with my brother and father, but my brother and I never spoke about what had happened between us since.

We pretend like it never happened, but I know that he remembers it in vivid detail even better than I do. All the dates are blurry in mind, and the ages I listed are approximation because I was too young, way too young, at the time. He, however, has the memory advantage.

Anyways, throughout high school, it got even worse for me, as I started discovering newer and newer fetishes. I got into 4chan and that just furthered the perversion. I got into 7chan and got into lolicon and shotacon. I got into TOR eventually and got my hands on some premium CP. It all tended towards rape of boys. I had fantasies of being gangbang raped and all sorts of really fucked up, REALLY ILLEGAL shit. I was worried about my dad because he was in a government position which was really politically charged. I got super paranoid that my Internet might be tracked. I would encrypt my illegal porn stash with a 40 character randomized alpha-numerical and random keyboard character password which I still remember to this day. I still use parts of it for my online banking, e-mails, Skype, Facebook etc etc. 

I have never had a girlfriend. I am kissless and have found myself compartmentalizing all my emotions whenever I meet a girl. I'm not even sure I'm attracted to girls. I did hire prostitutes when I moved out to university because I didn't want to be a virgin on top of that.

I do keep in contact with one girl. We met in a society and it started out fairly cold and distant as I had been with most other girls I had met before. I found her to be a very honest and compassionate person. She's been a shining light in my life. She makes me want to be a better human being. I ended up telling her all of this and it absolutely broke her heart for me. At a few points she just dropped all engagements she had just to be there for me and support me. She left a possibly very exciting night with her boyfriend at one time to stay with me. I had walked her to where the street forked. One led to my house and another to her boyfriend's house and she just sat there hugging me, crying on my shoulder for the pain I had endured and how cold my heart had become.

I ended up seeking psychotherapy which helped me talk through what I had gone through and what was going through my head. I got into some self-help books and motivation books. I deleted my modest porn stash - about 100 GB of very illegal porn that could've ended with me in jail for decades just for possessing it. I threw out my small box of sex toys - a fleshlight, a fairly sized buttplug, and lots of rope and twine which I used for self-bondage. I joined /r/nofap and went on a nofap streak of 100 days to sort of 'reset the clock'. 

I honestly still don't know how far I am from the goal. I still don't have a girlfriend and one time at a night club I was approached by a gay dude. I was open to the possibility that maybe I was just gay. However, when things started getting heated on the dance floor, I just remembered my experience with my brother and got absolutely sickened and manipulated by the circumstances. I don't think I can ever be with a guy.

Anyways, I've rambled on for too long. Some details are missing and I've missed some parts of my story in the process. This is probably going to get buried anyways because I am always late to AskReddit posts.

TL;DR - I had a homosexual relationship with my brother which started when I was VERY prepubescent. I met a true friend that got me to seek help, and maybe I am on the way to a better place. |-|

|-| cnvhp6r || 209 || Just a hair over a year before we split up. And frankly, it was like he became a different person after the marriage license was signed. 

I told him, from the beginning: no kids. He started pressuring me to get pregnant immediately. Joked about sabotaging the pill Would guilt-trip and all but extort sex, and insist on no condoms. I eventually just stopped so much as touching him close to the end. 

He didn't tell me how much debt he really had from his prior degree. He filed bankruptcy. You can guess where my credit score stood after that. 

He became increasingly jealous over the fact that I had friends. Not just male, but female friends. He'd demand to be shown the phone. He'd not be happy if I would text my friends and he wasn't privy to it. He would make comments how I'm a secret lesbian because I spend time with my female friends. He'd make remarks about how I don't need to see my mother. He'd just slowly and subtly guilt-trip me for not giving him all of my time and attention.

He'd constantly tell me "You're too young to know what you want" (6-year age gap), "You're delusional", "You don't know what you're talking about" when I had an opinion contrary to his. 

And constantly, constantly in my personal space. It would be to the point where I'd lie to him about my class schedule (I was in college at the time) and work schedule just so I could 1. be alone for a couple hours and 2. contact my friends without him hovering over my shoulder. I'd pick up extra shifts, anything to just. be. alone. for more than a second at a time. 

And he was NOTHING like that when we started dating. Not in the least. Sweetest, most thoughtful, intelligent guy you'd meet.  

If he cheated, I don't know, and don't care. But no one gets between me and my friends, and no one belittles me for having an opinion. HELL no.

In retrospect, I'm sure I was no prize either. I certainly was naive in thinking that life would be better if I had my own household and life and etc, but frankly, in retrospect, that's the one thing I'm glad wrapped up clean and easy. He's a memory, and stays that way. |-|

I talk to this one couple in their early 50's, very friendly, we're building a rapport, and one of the questions is "When is the last time you came to Disneyland?" Right away the wife starts LAUGHING and whacking her husband's arm. He seems pretty amused too, and confesses that it's his first time since he was 15, because he had a lifetime ban. Apparently he and some friends had hopped the fence back in the early 70's (back when there was a fence you could actually do this to) and had been caught. They all got drug down to Disney jail (there are *so many tunnels* underneath Disneyland) and had their pictures taken, and given their ban. He figured it had been long enough now that he would get away with it. I entered 20+ years on my survey and left it at that. Awesome guy.

|-| cnvhtm0 || 8 || I worked at a large corporate office in the MIS division.  Since I had managed parts of the construction of the building, ended up charge of the mainframe computer system,  had technical programming skills, and was part of the Disaster Recovery Team, after I was let go, they issued a Memorandum to Security, that I was never allowed to enter the building again, for any reason.

About 8 years later, since I had always spun this tale to my friends, I 
was traveling to that city for a basketball tournament with some friends, and they said "let's go to your old work place, and see if you're blowing smoke!"  So, we went out there about 6 PM, and the sitting Security Guard, was a guard I knew.  I, and my friends, asked to go down one level and look through the glass wall to see all the massive printers, tape drives, IBM mainframe blinking lights, etc., all banging along, but he as he did, he stated:  "isn't there a Memo banning you?"  He looked through the Emergency Access &amp; Rules Book and there that damn Memo was filed..... My friends went silent, and several 'Godamns' were heard.... he locked the front door, and led us down and let us all the computer area as mention for 60 seconds then walked us back up and out.  

Oh, the reason I was let go?  The hottest, most unattainable woman in the building ended up working in my division, and she ended up in a relationship with me, which we kept outside of work.... but in those days, it was considered a security risk, and frowned upon to date a co-worker in your division of MIS.  There were several VP level males, in fact males everywhere, that this woman turned down.  We were spotted at a furniture store together by my boss's boss (VP), and they called us in the next day, threatened both our employment, we both told them to kiss our asses; they fired me on Friday of that same week, and gave her a 'double secret probation memorandum' in her personnel file.  She had transferred from Corporate Accounting, to Development Programming, which they also didn't like.  You actually had to have a letter of permission if you had a relative working in your same division.  

We had a fairly short relationship, given the circumstances, but she was totally worth it.  I used to carry her picture with me to job interviews in case there were any gray issues..... what did she look like... Wonder Woman, only at 5'3".  It was just jealousy on the part of the turned down VP's.  I ignored this woman for a year, had worked for this company over 5 years, was seen on a Tuesday, and fired on Friday. |-|

My family had me in theatre, choir, youth group, and all kinds of other extra-curricular activities to "keep me out of trouble", so they trusted me pretty well.

One night (I was about 15) my boyfriend at the time had come over to watch movies. The stipulation was that we could lay in the bed and watch the movie, but the door had to be open. After a while, my mom came in to check on us and everything was fine, so she thanked my boyfriend for being a gentleman and shut the door on her way out. 

Immediately, as if the door shut had triggered some teenage hormone overload, we started making out and fooling around. He slid his hand up my shirt for a bit, but finally having some privacy, I soon directed his hand to my netherbits. Yay first (not self stimulated) orgasm!

We never got caught, which was considered a major triumph, and we found ways after that to hook up without my parents knowing. 

It wasn't until a few months later at my youth's "Purity Ball"...yes, we signed pledges and wore rings to signify our abstinence for God and marriage...that my dad delivered this humiliating speech.

He told the congregation he was proud of the strong lady I had become. That regardless of having a boyfriend, I stood up to teen peer pressure and hormones, and that he witnessed me deflect an attempt at immoral behavior while watching movies with my boyfriend one night...

Apparently, the blinds had been open and my bed faced them from in the house. He happened to be walking in from the garage and caught a peek at me removing my boyfriend's hand from my boob. 

I was mortified. The secret he must never know? The night I got my first orgasm, he thought I deflected my boyfriend from touching my boobs, when in reality I was actually directing him much much further south.

My dad was always a heavy drinker. Growing up, it was wasn't uncommon for him to get so drunk he'd fall down. In fact he was banned from several bars for being such an unmanageable drunk. It's not that he would cause trouble or fights (depsite him being a pretty big and intimidating looking guy), he was actually a really nice guy and likeable when he was drinking. He was just annoying and a liability when he'd get so drunk he'd start falling down, getting hurt, breaking things, and being a burden to the other patrons. So because of this, he drank at home a lot. He would drink large amounts of whiskey and on some nights he'd wind up falling down when stumbling to the bathroom or the fridge.

This was a regular occourance in my childhood and over the years, and it kind of became commonplace. I'd usually help him up if I could and other times I'd let him lie there and just try to make him comfortable let him pass out and leave him to it. My mom would usually be in bed  and not hear him fall, but i'd always hear it. Regardless of how or where he fell, the sound was almost always the same.

Well one night when I was staying at home on xmas break from college, I was laying in bed and I heard that sound. He had fallen. It was around 2:45 am. I got up to check on him per usual and he was lying next to the table on the floor. I went over to help him up, he grunted a little bit and wasn't helping me help him up at all. He was unusually loose and limp, wasn't speaking coherently and not attempting to help me at all. I figured it was because he was drunker than usuall.  Since I wasn't going to be able to get him back in his chair or even to his feet, I figured I'd make him comfortable and leave him there.

So I went over my usual routine. Checked his head to make sure he wasn't bleeding or badly injured, hide his whiskey bottle so he wouldn't get up and drink more, and looked to make sure his glases weren't broken, clean them, and put them on the table turn him on his side just in case he vomited. (Surprisingly, he rarley puked) When I took his glasses off he had a strained look on his face and an expression that seemed to stare right  through me. I usually ask if he's okay and I usually get a grumbled "yeah" or something similar, but all I got this time was a long strained grunt. Again, I figured he was just super drunk and didn't think much of it. I turned off the tv and went to bed.

I woke up 3 hours later to my mom frrantically banging on my door. She sounded panicked and blurted out "I think your dad's dead."

I sprinted into the kitchen and found him laying in the exact same spot I had left him. His body was cold to the touch. He wasn't breathing. He had died. When the coroner finally arrived, he estimated the time of death to be around 3 or 4 am. Later we learned the death was actually a heart attack.

When I look back, I wonder if the small unusual behaviors I noticed but didn't really pay attention were actually side effects of him having a heart attack. His behavior was different than usual and He WAS heavily intoxicated, but I can't help but wondering if my dad was dying right infront of me without me noticing. At the time I blamed myself for leaving him there and not investigating further. He died right where I left him. I felt terrible and I carried that guilt for a long time. I now know its not my fault, but I still feel guilty from time to time.

On the day dad died, mom asked me if I had heard him fall that night. My initial guilt and shame lead me to lie and tell her "no, I must have slept through it" I feared if I told her all of this she'd blame me. 

Of course, I know she wouldn't blame me, but I am still not sure about some of my family on my dad's side. I know for sure some of them would be disgusted I left him on the floor. Yeah, it sounds fucked up, but that's just how it was growing up in my house. I've never told a soul about this and never plan to (except reddit I guess) because I'm afraid of people will think of me as the pos who let his dad die.

Around the same time my Mother married a new husband who had quite a lot of money and she started sending me money each month to "help me out".  That money basically enabled me to do nothing except buy drugs, dive into addiction, depression, and isolation, in shitty one room apartments for about 7 years in various cities, while just taking enough pictures outside next to people to convince my mother I was having a great time and making tons of friends.

To this day she tells all her friends about the "Grand Adventure" I went on, and how happy she is that she had enough money to make it possible.  Although I would love to talk to some of my family about what I went through, and some of it's lasting physical and psychological effects, I never will.  If she found out it would be nothing but sadness, and I would have sinned for a second time.  First by flushing her money and opportunity down the toilet, and then by destroying her dream of the life I had led.  So .. when we get together for family events, and she pulls out the pictures and gets me to tell all the stories .. I just play along. |-|

He kept the affair secret but kept lots of evidence (love letters) in a box in the office bathroom. I made copies of all of it, and still have all of it. He fired me and I was going to use the documentation by planning a humiliating retaliation that would have gone very public, and the community would have jumped all over it. After I was fired, I spent the next few months (and years) pursuing my dreams, so the firing was a bit of a blessing. My animosity towards him quickly died down because i was living a really incredible life all of the sudden and I decided not to put a damper on my newfound good life by getting caught up in a fight with someone from the past.

I still keep the evidence with me, just in case I ever need it though.    |-|

Forgot to grab a basket.  "No problem, I have a nice big jacket on, I'll just hold them in my pockets!"  Went through checkout, paid for my rice and everything but the two gatorades in my jacket.  Stopped by LP, fucking $2 of gatorade I simply forgot about and fully intended to pay for.  She was a real bitch and didn't buy what I told her, threatened to call the cops on me for it.  Fucking for real?  I said just get it over I'll pay whatever fucking shit I was just tired of it.  Got fined $100.  Remember how I was really dirt fucking poor there?  That's nothing to scoff at. 

I won't spend another cent at any Walmart ever again.  Just thinking about that bs makes me angry. |-|

|-| cnvirne || 5 || Local college bar.   A friend and I were celebrating our other friends 22nd birthday.  We were having a good time drinking, laughing, and generally having a good time.  After about an hour we decided to head over to another bar in town to meet up with some other friends.  My two friends walked out the front door ahead of me and as I am about to walk through I hear someone over my shoulder yell "What did you say?"  I turn around and its this 5' nothing guy in a tank top and shorts, I point the outfit out because it was December and cold as hell outside, with a serious chip on his shoulder.  It takes me a second to realize he is talking to me, and I say "I didn't say anything" and he yells "What did you say to me Mother Fucker!!"  In that moment I knew shit was about to go down, but before I can do anything I was grabbed from behind with my arms pinned to my side and the little guy starts punching me in the face.  I take a few on the chin while trying my best to move my head as to avoid direct shots and I am then thrown out the door onto the street by what I come to find out is the bouncer who just happened to be friends with Napoleon.  This all happened within about 10-15 seconds and as I hit the ground my friends notice what had happened.  The bouncer is yelling at me through the glass front door to "get the fuck out of here".  I was willing to leave but my glasses were on the other side of the bar and since I felt like I hadn't done anything wrong I threatened to call the cops if I didn't get them back.  The bouncers opened the door slightly and passed my glasses through, then I hear someone running at me.  Its the little guy running right at me screaming,  he had run out of the back door of the place and wanted to keep fighting.  I turned to face him and just as he got within 5 feet of me he trips and falls right into my arms.  I take the opportunity to pay the man back for my previous treatment by dragging him into the street and off the bars property.  I start beating the shit out of the guy, both of my friends can't believe what is happening and turn towards me to watch.  It was at that moment the bouncer came out of the front door without us knowing and he punches my friend in the face from the side.  My friend never saw it coming and had nothing to do with anything that had happened.  The first part of his body to hit the ground was the back of his head.  It was the most awful sound I ever heard, his head split open instantly, and a huge puddle of blood formed around him.  Everything seemed to stop.  I let the little guy go and he scurried off with the bouncer back into the bar.  The next few minutes are a blur.  We thought he was dead.  The blood was everywhere and he didn't move at all.  The ambulance and police came, my friend was unconscious for 20 minutes, he didn't wake until he was in the ambulance.  I told the police the story and they made no arrests and told us we could go to the hospital.  

My friend lived, but he has suffered from neck pain and headaches ever since.  His parents sued everyone, including the bar owner.  The court case took about two years to go to trial.  We were all deposed several times, and gave testimony to the court.  My friends family is upper middle class and he had one of the best lawyers in the area.  He was sure my friend would win a huge settlement and everything seemed to be going his way in court.  I wasn't present for all of the court case besides my days of testimony, but I did show up for the final day when the judge read the verdict.  The bar owner was found to have not been negligible, not responsible for his employees actions, no restitution due to the victim.  And then the topper, this is State Superior Court, the judge gives the order that my friend and I are officially banned for the duration of our lives from entering the establishment.  We couldn't believe it.  Just blown away.  

About five years later I was out with some other friends and they wanted to go to the same bar.  I put up a fight telling them I am not allowed but they all play it down, insisting no one will recognize me and that I should not be a downer.  So I acquiesce and off we go.  We get a table, order drinks and are having a decent time when I notice my friends faces are ghost white as I feel a tap on my shoulder.  It's two police officers.  They ask me to walk out with them and ask me if i am who I am, I tell them yes, and they ask if I know I am banned from the establishment.  I play dumb and tell them I wasn't aware.  The sort of buy it and tell me to beat it and don't come back.  I never did.  A few years after this the bar owner was busted for bribery and some sort of racketeering charges.  He was convicted and died before sentencing.  It was then discovered by my friend and his attorney that the judge from the original case and the bar owner had grown up in the same neighborhood.  The judge was by now retired and there was no way to reopen the case to get my friend the recompense he deserved.  It wasn't my fault, but I still feel guilty about this 23 years later. |-| 
|-| cnvirq4 || 20 || I was at a bar in Madrid once. This girl was walking by and we made eye contact. She stopped and turned towards me. After about 2 minutes of talking, she asked me if I wanted to go to her place since she had never fucked a Canadian. I said yeah, and about 10 minutes later we were in her room having sex. 

So I have never gotten laid that way, but I've been laid by someone using that method. |-| 
|-| cnvit2s || 8 || We were staying in a province in the Philippines for a week-long vacation. Somehow, one of the local fishermen managed to net this hawksbill turtle that my Dad bought for about $2 in pesos. We had it for a whole week and it was fun watching it swim in the ocean water with a nylon cord tied to its shell so it won't escape. 

When we were only a day away from leaving, my Dad finally announced that the turtle shall be killed and eaten by the neighbors once we leave. I didn't take this very well, and I was very vocal about it. The night before we left, I secretly weakened its cord by partially severing it with a nail cutter. The morning after, me and my brother took it for an early swim. It promptly broke free and swam away. My brother was aghast, and I had to act like it too. Naturally, my Dad was fuming and accused me (correctly) of setting it free. I said I didn't, and that it escaped by itself when it must have bitten the cord the night before (lame alibi).

Four years later, the whole family still doesn't know that I did it on purpose. I just can't stand the thought of that poor turtle getting killed. So wherever you are, dear turtle, keep safe. I hope you repopulate the ocean with your other turtle friends and wage a war on those who try to eat you. |-|

A few days ago I said in a post that feminists generally consider society at fault for stereotyping women, not just men. And that feminism is about teaching everyone, women included, to not hold old-fashioned stereotypes.

I was banned instantly for this.

Turns out r/feminism is run by a man who bans many feminists for having "accepting" or "non-extremist" points of view. While at the same time allowing a great number of anti-feminist posts.  There are several sub Reddits dedicated to trying to get him removed, and allegations that he is doing it all to make feminism look bad. |-|

She says I live right around the corner so we head back to her place. 

We walk in and she does the usual hostess stuff you want a drink or anything blah blah. Mentally I say fuck it and to her I say it's 3 in the morning why don't we go lay down. After that we go into her bedroom and started kissing, pulling clothes off, and next thing I have my head btw her thighs. The next morning got dressed kissed her goodbye that was it. I suspected that she probably wasn't openly bi-sexual or lesbian. When we talked after it was obvious that she just wanted something on the DL but I'm not sneaking around like some 16 year old.

They got together and I believe that he was under the impression that she was as good as it would ever get for him so they started dating, moved in together and then got engaged.


She was diagnosed Bi-Polar and had several different other mental issues that were unsettling, mostly sexual things (see sleeping with everyone I know) Myself, along with a few other friends suggested that getting married was not a good idea. They decided to go through with it and took off to Vegas. I skipped the wedding mostly due to financial reasons (Vegas isn't cheap) and partly due to the fact that I knew it would not last. They were married in August 2013.


Fast forward to December 2013 and I get a call from another friend saying that my buddy was filing for divorce, apparently she was cheating on him for most of the marriage when he found out and suggested counseling she went out and hooked up with two different guys in a 24hr period then told him about them too. He told her to move out and that was that.


The most unfortunate thing in my mind was that they had a dog and he decided that he wanted to keep it, she let him have it for a few months then said that she wanted it and raised a big stink, he let her have it and she promptly gave it to her friend who sold it to a 3rd party within a month.   |-|

|-| cnvjf59 || 3 || Drinking at the age of 17 in a pub. The drinking age is 18.

I went into the pub one day and decided to be ballsy and order a pint. The bartender asked for my ID, and I gave it him. Surprisingly, he accepted it. Then throughout the night I duped every bartender on duty by saying "Another Fosters please". I kept this up for every friday for about two months. Eventually, there was a new manager. Noticing she was new, I decided to work my way to her by ordering the first 3 pints off other bartenders, then I got to the manager. She did the unthinkable. She asked for my ID! I had prepared for this poorly though, so I pretended I forgot it. She said "You're not welcome back until you show me your ID". 6 months later, I went back in on my 18th birthday. I ordered a drink from the manager and I got ID'd. She looked at my birthdate and gave me the dirtiest look ever. She served me though. One month after this, cheap beer got the better of me and I did something stupid. It was nothing obnoxious or harmful, but enough for  me to not disclose it without a throwaway, and for the manager to kick me out and tell me I'm never welcome back. 6 months later, I went back in. The manager saw me and said "you're not coming back in. You blew your chances"

I feel like such a jerk because I could have cost the young bartender who first served me his job. I wish I would have thought of that before I did it. Luckily, he still works there. I was lucky I didn't get banned when they found out I was underage. I don't blame the manager at all, it must be horrible dealing with idiots like me. |-|

|-| cnvjmpn || 3 || I was banned from Switzerland after pleading guilty to forgery. American touring Europe on the cheap for the first time with an experienced traveler. The "brilliant" idea he sprung on me when we arrived was the Eurail train passes we purchased ahead of the trip would have to be filled in with erasable ink in order for them to get us from west to east and back. About 3/4s into the trip and mine still looked great but his looked like ass. A hot ticket agent on a train in Zurich approved mine but as soon as she saw his the jig was up. Police boarded and arrested us at the next stop. Quick admission of guilt at the station, hefty fine, bought legit tickets and signed something that said we promised never to return to the nation.

TL;DR: Banned from Switzerland for forgery. |-|

|-| cnvjnjj || 4 || I once received a life time ban from a music venue. Our band was playing a headlining show. I was pretty short on cash that week. I decided to sneak in a few pre-mixed tequila and lime drinks. Little did I know, they did not sell these drinks at this venue. So there I was singing away with my drink in hand, suddenly my synth stops making noise, then my mic cut out. The bouncers pulled me off stage and started harassing me. I told them I was sorry, I would throw the drink away, could we at least finish the set? Nope. They were not having it. The manager (female) starting getting right n my face, yelling all sorts of nonsense, "Who do you think you are, yadayada...". She then proceeded to snatch the drink out of my hand. I held on to it and her hand slipped of the bottle, striking herself in the face. What happened next absolutely blew me away. She told the bouncers I assaulted her. So, of course, they start pushing me around. Next thing the entire band is in a fist fight with the bouncers. We were just a local band, but we had a lot of fans. They came to our aid. It did not end well for the bouncers, nor the club. The place was trashed. They told us we were banned for life and to never return. 

Two months later I was back on that stage. Although the bouncers didn't forget, they couldn't keep us out as we were pulling a good drinking crowd. Absolutely insane night.  |-| 
|-| cnvjo15 || 23 || When I was like 11, I wanted to get out of school the next day, so on the way home from a superbowl party with my mom I started acting like my stomach hurt , she said she'd give me something at home for my stomachache. Knowing this wouldn't get me out of school, I started fake crying and said it really really hurts, by this time we were already in the driveway of our apartment, she looked at me and said I'm gonna take you to the hospital but if your faking ,I'm gonna beat your ass! (mexican household ), so I stuck to my story and continued sobbing and saying it hurts, we get to the hospital and they don't know what's wrong with me so they wanna do a cat scan of me, my mom agrees and off I go, after the scan the doctor told us he thinks my appendix looked a little inflamed and that was probably the reason for the pain(I literally had no pain or discomfort anywhere ) and that they wanted to remove it which means surgery , my heart sank at the news, but I knew I couldn't confess now I was to deep. So they schedule the surgery for the next morning , the morning comes and about half my family is there for support and prayer.im super fucking nervous at this point so when the nurse gave me a shot on my butt cheek I accidentally tensed up and felt one of the worst pains of my life , they take me into surgery and everything thing went fine,the surgeon even came to recovery and showed me my appendix which was awesome! I stayed in the hospital for about a day then I went home but before that the doc told my mom I couldn't go back to school for about two weeks while cuts healed which was also awesome! Even better my church royal ranger group visited me at my house and brought me this big basket filled with snacks and candy. It was the best two weeks of my life, my mom made my brother get me what I wanted cuz she didn't want me moving around ,I just played video games the entire two weeks,then I had to go back to school.

I'm 22 now and have not told a soul I was faking being sick, I like to think of it as one of my greatest achievements. The end....sorry ma.

TL:DR- faked being sick and went into surgery just to get out of school.

|-| cnvjohe || 41 || Slightly ashamed owner of a lifetime ban from Walmart. My idiot friends and I used to go to Walmart from time to time and play the game of who can get kicked out the fastest. My buddy pulled a pretty good stunt and got kicked out in just over a minute so I decided to should for the sub 60 second mark. 

I sprint into the store like it's a Black Friday and they're selling 55 in tvs for a 5 spot and make a beeline for the toy section. Remember those tall metal containers with the bungee cords around them containing the kickballs?? Target sighted. So I blow past what I assumed to be a manager as he wore the obnoxious look of abuse of authority on his face while shouting at me to slow down. I pay him no mind and approach the container. 

About the 15 seconds in and I know I'm on track for a win. Crouching I spread the two lowest bungee cords apart,  letting loose a torrent of kickballs down the main aisle. They flow out for a couple seconds before I let the cords snap back into place and promptly run along behind the balls, kicking them forward and screaming "Be free! Be free, my children!" 

Mister manager man comes around the corner and quickly adopts the slack jawed look of complete shock on his face for a moment before recovering, turning red, and screaming as me to "get the fuck out and never come back to my store, you little..." The end of the sentence died on his tongue as he realized several other patrons were now enjoying the show. 

He waded through the kick balls towards me, but I quickly headed for the door before I could be forcibly removed, all the while being assaulted verbally, and rightfully if I'm being honest, by this manager. Hit the doors at a sprint and screamed "Time!" At my shocked friends. 

34 seconds... The new record! Of course, my friends thought I was lying right up until the manager himself can blazing through the door, hot on my heels... 

Been back a few times without having a hit placed on me or anything, so I guess it worked out okay for me in the end.... We were such stupid kids... |-|

Well in the middle of the night Linda woke me up and told me to go inside the house with her. We went back in the house and into her room, she crawled into her bed and I slept on the floor in my sleeping bag I had bought inside from the tent. I was asleep when suddenly I felt a hot sharp pain coming down my back. I jumped up off the floor tore my shirt off and ran to Linda's parents room screaming. I showed them my back, where the pain was, and Linda's mom let out a gasp. I went over to the mirror to look at my back and I saw two small puncture marks followed by a long scratch down the lower half of my back. Linda's dad gave me a shirt and we went back to Linda's room to see if we could find what bit me, by this time Linda was sitting up in bed asking what had happened. We look into the shirt I had ripped off and inside was a centipede about 8 inches long! I freaked out and did the heeby jeeby thing where you shake all the gross off whenever you see a nasty bug and this centipede was NASTY!! Linda's dad got tongs and put it in a tupperware and for the rest of the morning Linda and I discussed different ways to kill the centipede. We could have let it go but fuck that, this thing was a monster and had to be destroyed and my back still really hurt. We decided to suffocate it with bug spray but that didn't work. Then we let it out and tried to smash it with a brick but that didn't work, centipedes are made out of some kind of armor. Finally we took a shovel to it and tried to cut the centipede in half but all we managed to do was stop it from moving around (we were also two very weak 3rd grade girls). Then Linda's father got involved and doused it in lighter fluid and set a match to it. This might sound sick but it was pretty satisfying watching that little fucker burn. I did learn something through all of this though and that is to shake out your sleeping bag before bringing it into the house. Or just don't go camping and sleep indoors. |-|

What's sad is that this boy, Chris, nobody ever remembers him. John was so well liked by our entire school. Our whole football team put his name on their helmets, everyone took a quote from his bio on IG to use as their senior quotes. Girls wrote 'RIP. John' on their binders, and we all celebrated his birthday. But everyone forgot about Chris, John's quiet best friend who died too. |-|

Its a hard life sometimes in peak season and in the slow times.  But, if you have a sense for business, a lot of union guys and girls go into business for themselves over time snd rake in upper six figures supervising or doing minimal manual labor.

This was right before closing at like 1 am so when his dad showed up he tried to pick a fight with my boyfriend.  I stepped in the middle (as my boyfriend was a) a pussy and b) should not have to deal with fights that I started).  I started bouncing with a boxing defense stance and told him to swing, it'll feel good and I needed a good fight.  I weighed 115 pounds and he was a good 250.  I also threatened to shove a laser gun up his kid's ass if he touched me again.  I'm not allowed back there anymore but the workers thought it was hilarious.  The kid got banned too. |-|

|-| cnvk4qo || 8 || Between the ages of 4 and 11 I was sexually violated by my uncle.  He's an executive for a private insurance company that specializes in small business accounts.  He helped my dad get an extremely low rate when we were going through a rough time financially.  When the abuse was most frequent, 6ish-10ish, I was consistently reminded that if I told anyone he would bankrupt family and I would be taken away.  That's when I learned what bankrupt meant.  Young as I was, I believed him.  To this day my parents know nothing, I think.  I remember my dad hearing rumors from this uncle's wife about incidents involving his daughter.  I remember my mom arguing with him about letting him babysit me (that's where the bulk of the abuse took place).  And when I was approaching puberty my mom would sometime ask me if anyone ever did anything inappropriate to me.  But I never heard anything of it after that.

At 16 I developed a restrictive eating disorder.  At 17 I attempted suicide by overdose.  My parents never called it an eating disorder, or the suicide a suicide for that matter.  It was a "phase that we just don't need to talk about at the moment ok dear?".  I dropped to 92 pounds when I entered college.  I was living in an sub-lease apartment for a time were I made a second attempt.  But they don't know about that.

Around this time, at 21, I discovered I was transgender.  My dad and brother disowned me, my mom followed but later turned around.  I really don't talk to them anymore, accept my mom sometimes.  It's awkward.  When I think of my family, I picture myself in the middle a void.

I suppose if I told any of them this, about the abuse, they would refuse to talk about it at first.  Then they would hate me for it.  It would just be another challenge against their memory of me.  They have this pleasant idea of me, when I was an honor student and dual-major on track to graduate with a B.S. in computer science at the age of 22.  They don't like to think about the eating disorder, suicide attempt, or the fact that I "think" I'm a girl now.  They want to remember me as I was, their perfect son.  I'm a ghost to them.

Right now I work 5 days on 5 days off, but when at work I can sit and play computer games all day long or watch TV. The few times there are rescues up I have to pay attention more (take headphones off) but there are also 4 other people to help out. I make something like 60k per year.
But also the benefits. AMAZING. I get 25 days off a year, which on this schedule means a whole lot of time (I just took off 25 days, which was only 10 of those days off). 

They pay travel/lawyer/home inspector/Realtor fees when they move you so all you have to come up with is the deposit. They come and pack your house, have someone load up a truck and drive and unload and unpack whereever you want it to go. They even pay for someone to come clean the old and new place. Its awesome. Not to mention they paid $150 per DAY JUST FOR FOOD for my fiancee and I to travel 8 days from Alberta to Ontario.

I broke my ankle playing sports for PT and got $15 000 cash. No tax no nothing, and they paid for everything with regards to the surgery and even for taking the plate out next month. No buying pills.

Also every 2 years you get full eye exam and a couple pairs of eyeglasses if needed...they are talking about laser eye stuff but that likely won't happen for a while.

BTW, I only have grade 10 with some grade 11 classes. I joined in 2007 at the age of 23 with absolutely nothing to my name, now I have my own house (1/3rd paid off), my own car(2010 vw wolfsberg jetta, paid off) and FIVE cats...yeah living the reddit dream. They even have their own room. |-|

Me and three friends went there for the batting cages. We brought out own bats, which was allowed. After an hour or so we decided to rent a golf club and a bucket of balls just to have some fun on the driving range. I'm a lefty and they rented a right handed driver so I had to sit out. 

But anyways, they were taking turns driving balls. We're all beyond terrible at golf. One of my friends fans of the ball twice, so he picks it up and hits it with his bat. Goes pretty far. The manager saw that and flipped his shit. Ordered us out and whatnot.

But the best part comes is that when we walk off the grounds, we take our bats with us. He thinks we stole the bats. As we're walking down the street two cruisers roll up on us and 4 cops jump out with their guns. They tell us to drop the bats and we do because we're not fucking morons. Then it all gets sorted out because our initials were all on our bats.

Wedding and everything went fine. FB posts continued to be "this is great" stuff. The guy suddenly didn't wanted her to work again, she was fine with that but then it became a "don't hang out with friends" which included us (50/50 men-women all in a relationship), and progressed to a "don't get out of the house without telling me" thing. FB posts stopped.

She got divorced 7-8m after the wedding, she told us that by the end of the marriage the guy just came home and asked if she wanted to have sex and eat the dinner. If there wasn't sex, he'll go out to "party" or something. |-|

|-| cnvkka4 || 4 || Everyone here got banned from a specific store or something. I feel like a badass-- because *I* got banned from Kentucky. The state. 

By someone who didn't really have the authority to and in a way that could never, ever be enforced. 

Story: my company sells machinery that's useful for cardboard recycling and, if you squint a whole lot and don't mind the fact that it's a blatant lie, plastics. A county in Kentucky ordered one of our machines for plastic, and of course, sales said, "Ok!" And sold them out worst machine. They included startup in the sale, which means a field engineer-- me-- had to go out and help them instal it. A year after they had had the machine delivered.

Fun fact: when our equipment was delivered in February of 2013, the building hadn't been constructed yet. The machine (which we clearly say not to get water on for risk of damaging it) was left outside under a pool tarp for ten months until the building was finally built around it. 

Startup went poorly; because of the time spent outside, there were a lot of bugs in tough-to-reach places (literal and figurative) that I had to deal with. I was there for 15 hours straight due to logistical problems, but we made the damned thing work. 

About a month later (a week after warranty runs out) we got a call saying to get my ass back to Kentucky because the machine was broken. I explained that our warranty policy was to give new parts in exchange for the old ones, but it does not include labor. I volunteered to walk them through changing the part (super simple-- maybe 10 screws/bolts max, and a little oil)

Nope! I was yelled at, told to, "stand behind [my] fucking product" and informed that she was an *elected official of the state of Kentucky!*

I informed her that that didn't change policy, and I was issued a ban henceforth from ever entering Kentucky again by that lovely elected official. Whose name I don't know. And who doesn't know my name. And whose facility I returned to to fix their machine, which they have subsequently refused to pay for. They are banned from doing business with us in turn. 

Bonus story of getting banned! My buddy (also a field engineer) had a job up in Ontario and he decided to drive up with his tools in the trunk. Border patrol looked at the tools and demanded he produce a work order if he was going to turn tools in Canada. He told them that it was more of a sales visit, faltered, said that it was technical support, and was banned by a Canadian border patrol officer who wanted to prove how big his dick was. 

Fun fact: there are a few jerks in Canada, and one of them banned my buddy from the country. And that shit's enforceable. To the best of my knowledge, he never went back.  |-|

|-| cnvl0zr || 40 || I was so close to helping her out, she was less than a day away from calling a divorce lawyer. Its not exactly within the parameters of the question but the story is somewhat relevant.

The poor girl not even 18 and it was with one of her fathers friends 6 or 7 years older than her. He was probably an undiagnosed bipolar but definitely a narcissist, reveling in her teenage drama, every other month or week before their marriage for a year they were together or "never seeing or speaking to him again and blocked him on all my social media and phone" but he would stalk her, talk to her, and they would be back together within the week. After one of their breaks where he hooked up with an old girlfriend, she got jealous and said she was still on birth control and tricked him into impregnating her for a revenge baby so he would stay with her, and he got super secretive after that, never letting her peek over his shoulder at his phone or computer. He used the baby against her when she got a restraining order against him for some of his extended stalking and verbal abuse. They got engaged because their cult of a church mandated they have to get married because they had premarital sex even with the restraining order. She violated it to go see him when her water broke and he drove her to the hospital. It was very awkward. 

Then not much later they're married. Big, expensive wedding in the biggest hall to rent in our town where their cult church is held. At home, his verbal abuse escalated to emotional abuse, gaslighting, child neglect, physical abuse "play wrestling" which would escalate to punches and her screaming "STOP" I couldn't drown out whenever I stayed at the house overnight downstairs, one time he just out of the blue yanked her hair really hard as she was just walking by him.

I finally got up the courage that night to tell her I saw myself from a former abusive relationship where nobody told me what he was doing to me was abuse. And it extended to their child where he would play video games &amp; let his daughter cry hungry in the other room for 6 hours face down in a puddle of her own overflowing diaper too young to roll over, and only pretend to be the best dad ever several minutes before the mom came home from work. I revealed this via text message late at night &amp; got some weird responses like "oh that wrestling is just playing I do it back to him all the time" and getting defensive on his side, till after 1/2 hour of conversing he revealed himself as he had been going through her messages and impersonating her to get information out of me. 

She saw the messages the next day and called me over and we both agreed divorce was the right thing to do since she was having to stay at her parents house overnight when his abuse would get too much since he refused to not be in the same bed with her and say things like "c'mon babe be into it, don't make me feel like I'm raping you" after big arguments and she didn't want sex but he went ahead with it anyway. She found out she was pregnant again shortly after our conversation (less than two? three? months after her first baby and a month or so after the wedding) and her cult brainwashed family and exclusionary small minded friends said its a lifetime bond she can't break or she's a sexual deviant and would be ostracized. Her marriage to that terrible man almost lasted 2 months but now she's been dragged down to his level and has Stockholm's syndrome, is barefoot and pregnant, and gotten bitter and more religiously brainwashed than ever before.

**TL;DR:** Very nearly did end it after 2-3 months of marriage, but cultish church social pressure with social stigma about pregnancy. |-|

This idea fascinated me and I didn't believe it existed so from that point forward I tried everything in my power to get to see it. Shoplifting was too petty Ii wanted to go for something crazy.  I pinched Cinderellas butt. I punched Goofy. I rocked the log ride till it flipped.  I took a piss off Tom Sawyers raft in front of the tour guide.  I popped those balloons inside of balloons the vendors were selling. I didn't keep my hands inside the train at space mountain or the Matterhorn. Nothing! Not even a "don't do that" from the park employees! High on my Grand Theft Auto-like one-man-Disney-crime-spree I finally got my wish for the lamest reason possible.  I cut in line at the teacups ride.  Apparently that is a Disney Jail-able offense! I got to see the Disney jail (not impressive) my annual pass got canceled and I was banned from the park.

Where to start? drugs, had sex with my cousin and a police raid

The amount of drugs that I used to do, (still do some) Still smoke weed, still occasionally pop molly, used to do mushrooms and cocaine all the time.

I had sex with my cousin, on many separate occasions. First time, she was 16 and I was 17. As kids, we always got along great and were each other's favorites. We always loved spending time together and got along really well. During the summer times, I'd always spend a week at my aunt's place and we'd hang out and keep each other company. I was about 12 and she was 11 and while I was sleeping, she snuck in my room and kissed me. I woke up right away and just stared at her, she had a huge look of shock, guilt and embarrassment in her face. I was pretty surprised but happy about it. I smiled at her and didn't say anything, we both had this awkward blushing silence going on. Then I just told myself fuck it and kissed her again. It was pretty awesome. Sadly, two months later her parents died and she moved away with her dad's side of the family. Her dad's family hated our family and my aunt was on my maternal side. So we never saw each other until years later.

I still remember that night, it was fucking magical. It was Christmas break and she came to town, I hadn't seen her in 5 years and holy shit did puberty work wonders on her. She was tall, long hair and had huge titties. 17 year old me full of hormones still thought about that night. I figured, meh, she's grown up, i'm sure she's over it. Lucky for me at the time, my parents, grandparents and another one of my aunts all lived within a 10 min radius of each other. My parents decided to stay at my grandparents place and all my cousins and I were supposed to stay at my aunts. Well, one of my cousins got in a huge fight with my (hot) cousin and things got physical, so my aunt told my (hot) cousin to get out since she had just fought with her daughter. So she's fuming mad and didn't want to go back to my grandparents since there were way too many people sleeping there and my parents place only had my two older sisters there. So we say fuck it and walk back to my parent's place. We get there and my eldest sister was already gone with the second eldest saying she went out with friends and she was going to head out also. 

House to ourselves then, we put on a movie and just chit chatting, in my head, I was soooo damn horny and just wanted to kiss her and touch her like before, I didn't give a damn about the taboo. At one point she just got up and calmly sat on my and put her arms around me. We cuddled a bit and by that time my dick was about to burst through my pants. She started moving her hips and ass around, she could feel my boner and just was teasing it. At that point I just couldn't take it anymore and just flat out told her, "I still think about the night you and me kissed" Her eyes LIT UP. She confidently replied, "me too" and then we just started making out and had sex...all night. It was fucking awesome. A couple years later we had sex again, it was amazing still, it's our dirty little secret, I'm not going to say i'm in love with her, but we're both really attracted to each other and want to fuck each other for fun. We spoke about it at great lengths the second time we had sex and we both feel the same way, we live 6 hours apart in different cities and enjoy fucking each other when we see each other. I'm 28 now and she's 27, last time we had sex was 2 years ago and it was probably the best sex ever. 

Police raid: Im lazy from typing the other story up so i'll just say it quick. Friend of mine was a big coke dealer, was hanging out at his place one day and a SWAT team showed up and took us all down. Spent the night in jail, I didn't get charged or anything but that was NOT fun.

I shit all over the floor. I spent the next couple hours cleaning diarrhea  off the floor. My poor mom uses that bathroom to do her make up and dry her hair.

Unfortunately not that day, she knocks on the door and asks if I am alright and says "must be a bad one today!" and went off to work without doing her makeup or hair. 

To this day, she doesn't know I shit on the bathroom floor and mopped up the shit with the bath towels we use to wipe our bodies down after a shower.

I was at the bar and across the bar I noticed this girl checking me out all night.  A few hours later and a few more drinks into the night, she came over to my side of the bar to talk to me.  First thing I said to her, drunk with liquid courage "Do you want to fuck or what?" 
To my surprise she said "Yeah!"  
Sure enough at the end of the night she came back to my place and yeah, we boned like a couple of elephant seals.  Drunk sex isn't very sexy.  
A few weeks later this chick came by the restaurant I was working at and I seen my sous chef sitting with her laying his moves.  I called him over and told him.  "That's the chick I told everyone about."  
He thought for sure he was gonna go to pound town. After a few more drinks and I'm not sure how he tried to seal his deal and get his dick wet.  He failed.  He asked her for her number and she replied, "I don't give my number out to guys I just met."
OH SHIT that was a burn. We all laughed at his expense.   |-|

|-| cnvlcn9 || 21 || A few years back, one of my husband's closest friends got married to a girl he dated for 8 or 9 years. Two months later, she starts cheating with someone she worked with (at a new job she had recently taken). She came clean about it two months later, and shortly after they split up, she found out she was pregnant (with affair guy). Affair guy turned out to be a bit crazy, and started threatening her. She begged our friend to take her back, and that she's put the baby up for adoption. He declined, and moved on. She wound up keeping the baby, but none of us have any kind of contact with her, so who knows what she's up to. The whole situation sucked- we loved her; she was basically family to our group. Our friend moved on and eventually married somebody else that we do not particularly like. Fingers crossed that wife #3 will be awesome... Only half kidding. He seems happy with wife 2, so we tolerate her.  |-|

When I had just went off to college, I was involved in some activity that was pretty not good.  I had started writing college papers - especially for the remedial English and foreign language students for cash.  I didn't really need the cash, but I was just really good at it.  At one point, one of my customers couldn't pay, so I arranged for him to pay me in sexual favors.  At the time I was really only interested in it because it was a power play (or so I thought), but eventually it became a primary way of getting paid/laid.  I really got off on it.  It didn't occur to me until much later that this was essentially me being gay and having a messed up way of dealing with it.  Anyways.  Papers for blow jobs, usually from straight guys, or guys looking to pass, and often from desperate students looking to avoid being flunked out and then returning home.  I got a fair number from cute girls as well.  I remember around mid-terms of my 2nd semester of freshman year I wrote about 40 papers.  I was getting blown 2 or 3 times a day for weeks (depending on the work level, it was 2 or 3 blows.  A few of the girls I fucked proper).  Of course, I ended up getting caught when the girlfriend of a customer/blower went to the dean for academics and blew the door off of the closet.  Being a good entrepreneur, I had a ledger, records, customer service notes, writing samples from the students that had ordered papers, estimated grades and actual grades (you know, to improve my product).  Also, some recordings of my better payments being received.  I was of course instantly expelled.  

I didn't tell my parents.

Instead, I moved in with some people from craigslist near campus.  That next semester I worked on getting myself in shape, I worked a lot doing temp jobs and doing some straight up legit paper writing, and eventually saved up enough money to travel south of the US border, assume a fake identity, and smuggle myself into the US under a false name.  I do not happen to be Hispanic, and I don't speak Spanish.   I established myself for the rest of the next semester in town under my fake identity, and then I applied to the same school, and was accepted on the spot after an in person interview. I got a new student ID, which helped me a get a new license.  I changed departments and went into a new major.

Everything went normally after that.  I continued going to school and was given a full scholarship under my fake identity.  I occasionally ran into people I knew from my first go around.  I told them I was allowed back in probation, but then avoided them.

It got really dicey during graduation.  I had started to change my fake identity so that I could pass between my real name and the fake one, using a shared nick-name.  When the time for commencement came, there was a form to write phonetically how to say your name.  I used the nickname, and then mutated the last name so that I could sort of blame the speaker to both my friends who only knew my fake name, and my parents and family, who were in the audience.  I got my diploma, and graduated.

About a year after I graduated, I forged some paperwork to show a legal name change from my fake identity to my real name.   I filed it with the school, paid a fee, and got a new diploma in my new name.  I told the registrar that I had been illegal when I was the school, and she was really caring and understanding.  I told her now that I had gotten my residency I could use my proper name and date of birth.  She had to fiddle with the computer (probably to erase the old me), and eventually she got it to stick.   A month or so later, I called someone else and added my real SSN to my record, so that I could be verified using the automated credential verification service.

TLDR: got expelled, assumed fake identity, merged them back into one, it's been &gt;15 years and I seem to be in the clear. |-|

I took 50 blank VHS tapes, copied the most gnarly porno I could find (this was 1993) and replaced every copy of The Bodyguard (most popular rental at that time. Complete with barcode and "please rewind" stickers and everything. This took roughly a full shift with the help of my co-worker. After the complaints started pouring in he dragged everyone into a meeting and said if the one who did it didn't come forward he would fire and rehire the whole store. I said "I did it, you deserved it, you're a stupid cunt and I'm out." and I walked out the door.

So, my mom goes out and I go to the beach and meet a really nice GORGEOUS girl. She was so smoking hot and after talking to her for hours we went to the night club and afterwards ended up finding a private spot on the beach were we went to 3rd base until we had to run for there were people coming. We exchanged numbers and planned on meeting up later during the week.

Well a few days later my mom takes me to a family party that is being hosted at some huge gazebo in the forest. As my mom introduces me to her entire family (She has like 7 brothers and sisters whom half I have never meet before for they all live in Puerto Rico) we continue to walk around until we meet up face to face with non other then the girl from the beach along with what looked like her parents...

Me and her were just staring at each other in shock and almost simultaneously we both asked our parents who each other were. And my mom smiles and says "Why, this is your cousin!"

So, yeah..That was probably the most awkward conversation I have ever had trying to talk to my uncle and aunt with her standing right there staring me down in complete shock and horror. I tried so hard to not puke on them after hearing that information, and once our parents left (and after a lot of drinks) we just laughed about it and decided to keep our "secret" to our graves.

**TL;DR**

I hit 3rd base with my hot cousin who I did not know was my cousin until a family party a few days later. My family will NEVER know.

I don't remember exactly what I said. Something about how maybe it wouldn't seem like that if she tried talking to the man instead of to herself. Basically an implication that she was the retarded brick wall. Not cleverly phrased enough to remember (clearly), but she caught the implication and kicked both me and the other guy off the bus and banned us from the city busses for life.

I still take the busses frequently, and I've never had any problems with my 'ban'. I've even gotten back on a bus with that same driver without issues (she doesn't seem to like to look at the passangers unless she's forced to glare at a student bus pass). |-|

Instead, my friend decided to go on a date and hooked us up. We dated for 6 weeks, then decided to get married in London at the place her parents got married. Come wedding time, we discover that the place we were going to get married in was in the middle of being demolished. We clean it up ,and in the midst of all the stress, get married there. Except on the altar, I say the name of the girl who hooked us up. After the ceremony, my wife runs off. I arranged to meet her at the airport to leave for our honeymoon. When she doesn't show, I go to get on the plane with my friend, the girls whose name I said on the altar, when my wife shows up and sees us.  |-|

I told her that I was meeting 's friend at 8 for dinner, so I had to go soon. I also figured bold man (and women) own half the world, so my literal words were "I'm meeting my friend for dinner at 8, but we can have sex before if you want.", she responded "do you want to?" I said yes, we went to my place and had really shallow sex for about 30 minutes before never seeing each other again.

|-| cnvlxu7 || 3 || Lifetime ban from my local golf course. A few friends and I (10 years ago, I was 15) had a little "camp" set up in the woods about 30 yards from the greens. We would shoot bottle rockets at the golfers as they tried to swing, roman candles too, and on a few occasions got one of those giant clusterfuck fireworks that you set down and it just shoots rockets for like 3 minutes. We would steal golf balls after the initial drive of a golfer, and were chased on many occasions. We did the air-horn thing from jackass too. There were other things we did but the list is long.
We videotaped it all, we thought we were pretty awesome. 
I went on vacation for a few days and when I got back to school, police officers came and got me, went to my moms classroom (she was the music teacher), and I watched the video with her and the police. Apparently my friend had left the video camera in a backpack at our little camp. Thats also how my mom found out I smoked ciggarettes. I deserved that shit. |-|

My buddies left, I went with her. 

As it turned out she was an artist and a big of a bohemian, we sat drinking beer, listening to Bob Dylan and smoking.

She showed me some of her art and I was massively impressed, she done a huge pen drawing of a forest, it reminded me a lot of Aokigahara and I really liked it, I even offer to buy it off her.

One thing led to another, we ended up in bed all was good. 

Until I woke up at 5am and she's standing in the middle of the bedroom with weird ass dagger raised above her head.

I lie still and ask her what's she's doing, she replies "Oh don't worry it's not for you, it's for the demon that followed you in here."

She was talking about Wicca and cleanses and I was putting on my jeans and leaving when she started screaming incantations and shit.

|-| cnvm1w6 || 3 || Not me, but this story needs to be told. My ex flatmate and our group went on a fishing comp weekend, culminating in a big party at the end on an island in a big top tent.

Cue 8 hours of drinking on the water, and then a few more in the tent and the presentation begins. Where's Ritchie?

Suddenly there is a commotion at the back, a naked Ritchie is climbing the center pole. He proceeds to get to a little platform type thing half way up, with security rushing around the bottom of the pole. He stands up half pissed and starts doing "the helicopter"

By this stage everyone is looking at him, egging him on. He brown eyes the stage and decides it's time to come down. He gets 2/3 of the way down, and jumps for it and runs just eluding the over weight guards, and like a jack rabbit sprints for the tent opening, trips and skids using his face as a means of stopping. No arms, just face.

Guards get him, and trespass him from the island. Only guy I know to be trespassed from an entire island. He tried to go back the year after, and while he could enter the comp, the guards remembered him as we came ashore and he was denied entry. He had to stay on the boat for the next few days.

I wish I could say this is one of Ritchie's most extreme story's, sadly this is pretty tame |-|

|-| cnvm59w || 26 || Just Cause |-| 
|-| cnvm5pz || 8 || My parents are both early 70's. We had a good family life but there were times that I sensed some unease there below the surface. They divorced years ago but it was friendly and my dad took care of my mom until she remarried. In fact they still see each other casually, usually while visiting my brother's family. It's all good with everyone.

I live across the country and my dad came to visit last year. While he was here he told me my mom was violently raped right before they got married. It explained a lot of things like the fact that sexual violence in movies or TV was not allowed in the house. I just thought my parents were conservative but it was my dad trying to make a cool, dry place for my mom. 

In the end it wasn't enough and her demons drove her to push my dad away. 

This really changed how I view my childhood. I can't look at old pictures now because the lens has completely changed. So many things make sense now but it fundamentally alters how I feel about them. I'm really torn as to whether I would like dad to have not told me or not if I had it to do over. Anyway, it's put me in this weird position where my mom's spirit would just snuff out if she knew that I knew and I have to hope against hope that dad never tells her I know.

Dammit, that felt good to talk about. Not even my wife knows this. Thank you reddit for listening. |-|

I had *three* buttons of my seven button shirt unbuttoned instead of two, on a day when it was 100 degrees in the shade, and the store had its door open and its air conditioning off.

I am male. I could wear a shirt that's *transparent* and it'd be legal.

I walked in, feeling like I might pass out from the heat at any moment, looking for cold beverages, and the manager came running up to me, screaming about indecent exposure and told me I'm banned. It took me a minute to realize that he was serious, and then to discover that he was the manager. I had half a mind to collapse dramatically to the floor and ask for an ambulance, but really, I figured by the time it arrived I'd actually need one so I told him to find a good psychiatrist for his delusional behavior and left to find someplace that would treat its customers like human beings.

My grandfather and I used to go swimming twice a week at the YMCA. They've got two sets of change-rooms there, a basic one and the 'luxury' one. They've also got two different saunas. The basic sauna is dry, smelly, doesn't work great... the nice sauna is in the luxury change-room. Apparently one day the basic sauna was out of commission so he was allowed to go into the nice one, instead. He remembered the code.

He started taking me in there every time, because it was so much better. We'd sneak in after a swim and chill out in the sauna, chit-chat, etc. And this went on and on for months. Finally, one day, a lady from the front desk intercepts us on our way back to the regular change-room after being in the sauna and she starts flipping out on us. She demands to know what we think we're doing. My grandfather turns on me, yelling, "I'M AN OLD MAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING!" and all of the blame is placed squarely on me.

We got out with an apology, because we're Canadian and this is Canada, but man... my grandfather didn't hesitate a moment to throw me under the bus. |-|

|-| cnvmm2k || 3 || I am the infamous Aunt Petunia from Superherohype dot com.  I pretended to be a woman for three years and made a name for myself there.  I got tons of email from guys wanting my body.  A body I took from an online prostitute who said she'd do anything in a private room for paypal cash.  So I took it upon myself to use her images to keep my masquerade going.  A masquerade I originally started as an experiment I was using to help me write a play for school.  I duped longtime efriends for years and nobody knew until...

I got tired of maintaining the lie so I decided to shake things up.  I contacted my eprostitute and told her I was using her images at another site.  I told her that she should get in on the joke with me and we could arrange some sort of meetup where I reveal my true identity.  I knew that this was a risk but if she showed up and started to rat me out, well that would be fun as well.  I knew what I was getting into.  Well she showed up and a scandal of gigantic proportions rocked the forums for a couple of months and I became infamous for years to come.

Lines were drawn.  Sides were taken.  People who had been my friend shunned me and people who rarely gave me the time of day applauded my long con.  Cats and dogs living together.  Mass hysteria!!!  I changed my username to Franklin Richards and stayed around for years to come untill...

A new guard swept through the Hype Forums and I found myself being moderated by kids who grew up around me.  I stayed the same and everyone else started going soft.  Opinions were stifled and snark was looked down upon.  I became one of the few Old Guard.  A relic from the Silver Age.  And I still had people who garnered long held animosity towards me for my scandal.  A demerit system was put in place and I of course racked up my fill.  Being one of the member who had been there a long time it was only a matter of time.  Smartass remarks and sass was the end of me.  I even got a demerit for "insubordination".  A badge I'm proud of.

Where I was in June 2003 and why I never give specifics on what happened.

I was in Iraq at a small "base".  I was guarding a handful of Saudis that were getting paid (very well) to pick up trash along a fence.  There was a regular chain-link fence with razor wire at the top.  Just inside the fence were 3 foot tall concrete barriers (like highway dividers) lined up all along the fence, then about 8 feet away, there was a mound of dirt/sand that acted as a wall (so, fence to inhibit troops, barriers to inhibit vehicles, and the berm to block vision and bombs exploding at the fence).  No one usually was in between these two, only patrols and once every two days, trash crew (the people I was guarding).  On this particular day in June, a couple of assholes decided to pop off some shots at the base.  They happened to spot me and my crew.  They fired at us.  I yelled at my crew and the other guard with me to get over the berm.  I didn't make it, the shots were hitting near me and I didn't want to risk it, so I hid behind the concrete barrier.  As I stayed there, getting shot at, I called it in on the radio.  When there was a break in the shots, my fight-or-flight kicked in and I returned fire.  

I'm a hick from a small town in the middle of some corn fields.  I've been shooting skeet and targets since the age of 5.  I got a 30-06 for my 7th birthday.  I've never had a scope on any of my guns, and so, I'm pretty good with fixed sights.  These guys were trying to get me with a shot.  I was behind cover, they were not.  I had an accurate M-16, they had some old-ass AKs or something they probably dug up years ago from a dead Russian soldier's grave.  I got off 4 rounds before I saw the first guy collapse.  I ducked down and low crawled 20 yards on down the fence line, recovered and busted off the rest of the magazine.  By the time I fired that last shot, both the 2nd and 3rd gunmen were on the ground, not moving.  I went back down, changed mags, moved 30 yards down (10 yards back past were I initially started) and came back up and drew on them, still no movement.  By this time, a Humvee was tearing ass out that way.  It was the Army responding to my radio call.  

Another group came from the inside of the fence to where I was.  They checked on everybody, then after some discussion on what went down, they took me off to a security tent.  They took my gun and sat me in a room for debriefing where I told them pretty much what I just typed above.  They told me what they found, 3 dead insurgents, ~250 yards outside the wire, armed with guns and an RPG.  Turns out, they were planning on causing some death and destruction with some rocket attacks on the base, but I ruined their day.  If I had been Army or a Marine, I would have gotten a pat on the back and someone would have bought me a drink, but I was Air Force.  Apparently Air Force guys were supposed to curl in a ball and suck their thumb at any sign of trouble and wait for the Army or Marines to come and unfuck the situation.  Since I didn't do that, I got sent to Mental Health (a shrink) to find out why.  I was put on suicide watch and ordered to attend therapy sessions for the rest of that month.  I was released from that just in time to transfer back to my regular job working aircraft in another part of the desert.

They put the whole Mental Health part in my records and it was a major reason why I was denied re-enlistment (shooting back at people who are trying to shoot you is a sign of insanity or something).

People look at you different when they know you killed someone.  My friends in the Air Force did.  Some who were not really friends, just acquaintances, just stopped the friendly chit-chat and avoided talking to me as much as possible, at least it seemed that way.  That's why I quit telling people this story.  My family is different though, there's another reason I don't tell them.

When I was younger, I had a lot of issues at school.  I was sent to guidance counselors for most of my school years, and many of them dubbed me "anti-social" (I'm an introvert, so, they were not exactly wrong).  To my parents, anti-social = possible serial killer.  So, add "possible serial killer", gun lover, (I have an extensive collection of guns and a lifetime NRA membership) and guy that killed some people in Iraq with no remorse (they shot at me, fuck them), and you'll see why I will never tell them.

Anybody who reads this that wants to jump to conclusions, read further.  I am an introvert, not a serial killer or a sociopath, I don't hate people, I hate *being around* people.  When given the option of "just hanging out with people" or "sitting at home alone", I chose to stay at home.  I feel uncomfortable in large groups (large being more than 20ish).  My guns are used to assault pieces of paper and disks made of clay.  I haven't shot anybody else.  I don't even hunt (nothing against hunting, I just have no use for the dead animal, I can't store a lot of meat in my tiny freezer, it's easier to just buy venison off someone else).  I have no desire to do that again, but, if faced with someone trying to kill me, I will defend myself until they stop, whether that means they give up and retreat or die.

**TL/DR:  Shot and killed 3 insurgents who tried to kill me, already have parents/family who think I'm a borderline sociopath** |-|

|-| cnvmoqq || 8 || God, did this one rock my town. Last year, when I was a freshman, a senior. A little background- he had, a day earlier, been on meth and literally tried to eat his friend. Started clawing at him, assaulting him, and the cops were called. That situation is broken up, and then there's a second situation the next day. They never told us what happened, but when cops got there, he was on meth, and attacked a cop with a baseball bat. The officer goes down, and Oscar raises his bat up above his head, evidently to bring it down on the cop's head. So the cop opens fire, and kills him. The next day, everyone is understandably solemn. Then we get to day two. Suddenly, everyone is saying what a martyr Oscar was, and what villains to society the police are. Someone who had previously just been another tweaker suddenly became the hero of a bunch of high schoolers, and that honestly makes me kind of sad. He'd assaulted and tried to kill a cop, and him dying in the process makes him a hero? Don't get me wrong, it was tragic. An absolute shithole of a situation. But the fact that people rallied behind him is kind of insane. There are people actively working toward furthering humanity, and a tweaker who assaults a cop suddenly becomes a symbol of justice?... |-|

She was also the family member who lived closest to me when I was at university.

My parents can never, ever know that about 20 years ago I went to visit her...and one glass of wine turned into several, turned into liqor, turned into me drinking my own grandmother into unconsciousness. Not "oh, she's had too much, best she goes to bed" unconsciousness. No, "oh shit, she's dead" unconsciousness. She wasn't, happily...but, eh.

While he was there, he woke up in the middle of the night in one of the cabins. These cabins are old as fuck too, like creaky floors and super old cabinets and such. He said that in the corner of his vision he could see a like dark figure, almost like the grim reaper, sitting there beside me bed. He said the only thing it did was take it's hand and put it on my forehead. He was scared crazy and could barely sleep there for the rest of the week. |-|

In my ever slight defense, the undercover jackass kept using a "have seen my daughter?!" and I kept my jacket with the item wrapped in it with me the whole time while helping him search for a missing little girl. He disappeared, I walked out and whose voice do I hear behind me the second I'm out the door? I was 14. 

From a Wal-Mart: A buddy and I went on a movie run at like 2AM, got all our goodies and left. After we got in the car and saw a cart sitting in the middle of the lot and wanted to be good guys and put it back. I asked him to pull up next to it and grabbed it. We drove along and tried to direct it into the corral...and missed. It hit a van very solidly in the side door at roughly 20 MPH. We panicked and bailed(I know, we suck). We went back maybe a week later and we separated to do whatever shopping we had. About 10 minutes in, there's a call over the loudspeaker with my name asking me to come from the front of the store. There's my buddy surrounded by 2 security guards and 2 managers, I walk up and ask what's wrong, they tell me they have footage of the entire thing and we're banned. We were 20ish. 

I went to the K-Mart once a few later, no problems. I've been to the Wal-Mart maybe half a dozen times since then. No issues there either.  |-| 
|-| cnvmur3 || 11 || My colleague told me this yesterday over lunch in hopes that I would not turn into a madwoman like his ex wife. I showed him and he requested to share his story here.


A little bit of background (hope I get this right). This story is coming from the South East Asia part of the world where sons (in most cases eldest) are responsible for their family, be it before or after marriage. In some families (though it is no longer being practiced as much as older days), wives must move in to the husbands' family. In some cultures, after parents married off their daughters, daughters are no longer the responsibility of her family but her husband's.


&gt;I am the only son (and a sister) while ex wife though is the eldest daughter but not the only child (2 brothers and another sister). Throughout our relationship, she was very normal. A happy-go-lucky, cheerful, understanding and almost a wife and mother material. After we got married, her parents tried to control me. We were staying with my family and her family wanted us to stay with them instead. The real kicker came when the first child was born and it is a son. Using our son as a leverage, ex wife threatened me to purchase and move into a house next to her parents. She left our house and moved not her parents as a sign of protest. The following 3 months was filled nothing with love but with threats being thrown at me. I filed for divorce when she decided that my parents are not as important as her parents and that they can live very well without me. She spent the next 6 months pleading to come back and refused to sign the papers. She signed when I said I would get a restraining order on her and that I can divorce her under 2 grounds. 

&gt;My advise - be firm on your decision. If you are not happy, do it. Do not trade your lifetime happiness for the sake of pleasing others.

I got a job as a community youth league soccer referee at age 12 making $14/game, and all I had to do was watch the game and know when to start it and stop it. I learned how much I loved being a part of the game, so I took a training class to learn all the crazy reffing rules and got certified as a real, live FIFA soccer referee at age 15. I started refereeing middle and high school level competitive soccer games for an average of $65/game. I ABSOLUTELY still do it.It's the best thing in the world to be able to spend an hour and a half watching your favorite sport and earning a ton of money for it. I love it; it's one of the most fun jobs I've ever had - the money isn't even close to the driving factor of why I do it (although the whole paying-for-college thing DOES help.)

If there's something you love doing, figure out how to apply it to something you can offer to others. I could have just spent all my time watching sports on the couch, but I turned my love of soccer-watching into an "offerable" skill and created opportunities to discover a job that not only makes better money than many post-graduate starter careers, but is satisfying, fulfilling, and also lets me do what I love. |-|

As if the cops, who have pensions, families, and other cops to deal with, are walking around abusing their power. Do you not realize that if IAB finds out that a cop is being abusive, they will not only strip that person of their badge, gun and often their job, but also whatever pension they have worked towards, and will put them in jail along with other bad cops? The real problem is with people who knowingly choose to break the law, and do not want to suffer the consequences. Follow the law, you will not be stopped by police. End of story. No excuses.

If anyone thinks the police is unfair, try being a cop for a week, or even asking a cop to describe the people who give them the most trouble. Most people do not deal well with people who disrespect them unintentional, but imagine if people disrespected you to your face day in and day out every single day simply for wearing a blue uniform? Police officers are people with feelings and families, and if it comes down to their life versus yours, they will most (and validly) choose their own. |-|

|-| cnvn56n || 5 || We had a couple of deaths in high school. 

One that will always stick out is a girl named Renae she was a few years older than me and seemed quiet and shy. One day she got on the school bus with a dress on a hanger but instead of covering it with a zip up clothes cover she used a garbage bag. To keep it clean etc. 

Well being the shit hole of a school I went too people started teasing her calling her Garbo. This escalated to all sorts of shit over the year and she was teased heaps. 

One day our bus didn't stop at her stop and the next day and the next. 

We found out she had attempted suicide by hanging and it didn't work. She then tried again by overdosing and succeeded. 

I don't know what her home life was like or not did I take the time to get to know her. But I can guarantee that her experience on the school bus probably contributed to her death. 

I am guilty of calling her Garbo. Just once. Because I was also not so popular and I wanted to look cool in front of my friends. Renae if your out there somewhere I want to say sorry for calling you that and if I knew back then what I know now I would have told all the people on the bus to shut the fuck up and I would have sat with you and made the attempt to get to know you. I am so so sorry for the hurt and pain you went through. RIP.  |-|

The kicker was that I leaned back in my chair and lost balance and grabbed the tablecloth. This in turn knocked over everything, including a bottle of wine that very nearly fell on a child's head at a neighbouring table. After that the waiter came over and said we were banned.

In elementary school I played baseball, chickfila was one of our regular "after game hangout spots," we would all get food and sit together and talk while the moms mingled, you know. Well for my birthday, which happened to be mid season I got a new bat and I loved it. My teammates were envious and so i let them use my new bat when it was there turn to swing our next game. Then to our surprise, we won, this had never happened before. We were all somehow believed that it was all because of this magical bat. my friends and I then got in my moms minivan and drove to chickfula to celebrate. We decided to take the bat inside to hopefully continue our good luck in some way. I still remember running uncontrollably through the big glass swinging doors jumping in excitement before it happened... I had gone in with my cleats on eliminating any possibility of traction on the hard tile floor. So I slipped... bat in hand. The bat smashed into the soda dispenser full blast and an assortment of carbonated beverage began flowing out uncontrollably from the machine. My mother was horrified and began apologizing, but to no use, I was banned. Two years later however, and without the baseball hat, I had grown up enough they couldn't recognize me and was able to go in without being ashamed.

|-| cnvo15f || 67 || I was married in August and left by Christmas (2009).  Dated him for 4.5 years beforehand. There were so many warning signs and he got (more) controlling after we were engaged. I say more because I didn't realize he was controlling at the time- it is always so gradual. He demanded his engagement ring back several times, he started telling me he didn't like my best friend (who hated him), didn't want (let) me to maintain any relationships with my guy friends, didn't like me wearing low cut shirts or tightish pants (note that I am quite conservative), he decided to accept a phd without telling me after I'd accepted my own position out of town (I had to withdraw my acceptance so we could stay together), also he was an alcoholic.  He'd party with his (single) friends 3-5 nights a week.  He was so difficult to deal with when he'd come home hammered and stoned (i.e. often picked fights). He pinned me against the bed one night and told me to "Shut the fuck up." 

I told him I wanted to postpone the wedding and his response was "no."  I felt I had no choice. 

Once we were married he'd tell me many times when he was drunk that he "didn't know if [he] wanted to be married to me." The final straw was his birthday - he demanded sex.  At this point, I had previously told him I didn't love him anymore, and would only have sex if it was from behind, no kissing, no talking, no eye contact, and over quickly.  He didn't care that I felt that way. I cried the entire time. I felt violated and used.  I consented only because it would be more difficult to say "no."  I left 5 days later.

In the time we were separated before divorce, he followed me, recorded phone calls, showed up at my parents house at 3 am 2 hrs from his house, showed up at my best friends apartment when he knew I was there, and slept with his students - that's just what I remember - I know I've repressed some of it. 

I was terrified of him.  Since then I've dealt with severe anxiety issues and I have a hair trigger fight or flight response.  I'm shaking from nerves even thinking about this.

|-| cnvo3k4 || 20 || I was banned from Best Buy, when I bought one of their work shirts at Goodwill and pretended that I was an employee. I lasted about 30 minutes before I was escorted out. Guess I shouldn't of told that customer to "Fuck off" when he asked where the bathroom was. |-| 
|-| cnvo3uw || 7 || That from the time I was 13ish I would dress as a girl. Once I moved out ( out of the city several several hundred kilometers away ) I started dressing as a girl regularly and began seeing a therapist to determine if I was possibly transgender.

During a visit back home my mom let it slip that she had been suspicious about me wanting to be a girl, baited me by saying my name would of have been Rebekah.

There was a tense moment of silence, and I could see the fear in her eyes. She didn't want her young man to suddenly be her daughter. So, I cleared my throat and told her that if God had wanted me to be a girl I would have been, and that I would have been very happy with the name Rebekah.

She let it go, and I made sure to be extra 'manly' around them going forward.

To this day I am still quite confident that I am, I feel like being a woman would be more 'me'. But to fit into their image of me I have been married and have two children. Both daughters. My only cling left of my femininity is to help my daughters become the women I always hoped I would be.  |-|

|-| cnvo7k3 || 3 || Several places, the one that stands out was Sun Cruz Casino boat in Florida.  They have about 5-6 locations in the state.  I was with a group of friends and we shipped out on the boat for a night of gambling.  Well open bar and international waters is a bad combination.  I gulped back a couple of adios mother fuckers and was WASTED.  I fell on the deck and some old guy picked me up and I ran to take over the karaoke mic and sang sweet child o mine.  I may or may not have had sex with someone from the poker table.  

Anyway, they tried to put me in boat jail.  Which was a poorly conceived notion that I sit on an upside down trashcan...and I calmly told them "You're going to have to throw me in the ocean, because I don't sit on trash cans."   
I was taken to a smaller area off the bar and I told the other cruisers how I was in boat jail and we should all fight the system and take the boat.   Mess ensued. 
So they let me use the dock to disembark their shitty ship and as I did, they told me I have a lifetime ban and it starts now.
if you're still reading this... fun fact, about 6 months later my same group of friends convinced me to try a different city.  Sure enough, they had my picture in the ticket booth and told us all to leave LOLOL |-|

My mom used to hate her, really hate her, mostly because she knew I liked her, and she was jealous. 
Anyway, I traveled all the way to her city, with the help of my father, he bought me the tickets, stayed there for two whole weeks, and came back, and she never knew about it.
I told my mom I was going with a few friends, to a neighbour city, to spend the summer there, and she bought it. Even helped me pack my stuff, and gave me money. 
Also, my father doesn't know that my mother doesn't know I went there.

He got married to a girl at the age of 22 who he had been dating since high school. They spent $20,000 on their wedding in the early 90s. They were done in two months. She decided to start cheating.   

The second marriage was when he was in his late 20s. He was with her for two years. Within six months, she went crazy and tried to kill him. She went to the loony bin for a while after that. 

He got married semi-recently, so hopefully this one works out better for him. |-|

|-| cnvoigl || 29 || not quite under the line, but as I'm one of those people, I'm posting anyways.  
 got married in Feb 2012. DID NOT know him well enough, and definitely didn't know his family. I was manipulated into moving more than 750 miles away from my family to "take care" of his mother with Rheumatoid arthritis. I basically spent the 7 months locked in a 3 bedroom trailer with three people with the following OFFICIAL diagnoses: an unmedicated paranoid schizophrenic brother-in-law, an unmedicated borderline personality mother-in-law, and a step-father-in-law with SEVERE obsessive compulsive disorder- not to mention my EXTREMELY emotionally manipulative husband. all four were mentally and spiritually abusive toward myself and each other (I was told that if I was not baptized a mormon that I wouldn't be 'trusted' to be alone in the house every again... considering that this happened for about 20 minutes once a week, that was not something I was willing to give up). 7 months in, I tried to have a rational adult conversation with my mother-in-law, explaining why it was inappropriate for her to call her husband at work and loudly call me a cunt because I had accidentally put a dirty fork in her soaking water (WHEN SHE HAD ALREADY SPOKEN TO ME ABOUT IT), my brother in law stepped in and tried to tell me how 'abusive' I was being by trying to talk to MIL while she was still upset- I told him to shut the fuck up and he punched me in the stomach.  
husband and I were homeless for the next three weeks before a friend let us move into the small apartment over his garage. I proceeded to spend the next 6 months singlehandedly supporting my husband. his retail job was giving him only 12 hours a week or less and he felt he "owed it" to his manager to be available at her beckon call since she had "taken a chance" on him when he'd been looking for a job for so long (Read: 8 days. he got the job 8 days after we moved to Pennsylvania). I started threatening to leave in June of 2013. Every time I tried to voice a concern, whether it was that I needed more help around the house (when working 60 hours a week and in school) or that his family WAS FUCKING PSYCHOTIC he would curl up into the fetal position and cry.  
in October 2013, we found out my 18 year old cousin had advanced mesothelioma and probably wouldn't make it to 2014 (he didn't). I told my husband I needed time alone to talk to my mother about arranging a flight home for his eventual funeral and he LOST HIS FUCKING MIND. he went off SCREAMING AT ME for a good 45 minutes about how "selfish" i was that I couldn't even spend 10 minutes with him and why, why WHY was I being such a bitch, because the conversation could wait. I'll be honest. I wasn't nice. but, when 5 minutes after the screaming had stopped and the crying had started, I heard an odd noise. went into the bedroom to find my husband trying to slit his own throat with a dull throwing knife. I left within an hour.   
today he's hiding from me. he apparently googled the divorce laws for my home state, and knows that I can't get a divorce in-absentia unless I can unequivocally prove I haven't heard from him nor have I been able to find him for an entire year... so every six months, he sends me a new (fake) address to send divorce papers to.  |-|

|-| cnvoj5s || 30 || Probably not that bad, just disgusting. I have a friend that doesn't shower, brush his teeth, do his laundry or change his clothes...like ever. It's pretty fucking gross and I hate hanging out with him because he smells like shit. He wonders why he can't ever keep a girl interested and when I point this stuff out he acts like he does all this when he knows he has a date, but what he doesn't get is that unless it's routine, showering once doesn't get the musty smell off...and not for nothing, I honestly doubt he even does attempt to freshen up when he has a date. 

He knows I know about this, but he doesn't know that I know he never takes care of himself. He thinks I think it's not as bad as it really is. 

Edit: added a small bit

Edit 2: guys, I've told him about his hygiene already but he refuses to change it. He knows I know, I've said my piece, but he just doesn't do anything about it. He has excuses every time so I've given up trying. I've been a good friend and I've told him what he can/should do. 

As for getting him a basket of hygiene stuff, he's just going to either not use it, or throw it away. It's sad but true.  |-|

|-| cnvolia || 22 || I went through with the wedding because I loved her obviously and I thought she loved me.  I mean she "proposed" to me in a messed up way.  As in guilt tripped me into proposing.  I'm an idiot.  Anyway.

What happened was she became a different person.  Was never home when I was.  Always with "friends".  Stopped paying rent and other bills.  I had to pick up the slack.  She got "mugged" so I gave her my credit card so she could get necessities (gas, ect., dumb move) and she runs thousands up on it on irrelevant junk.  Then when she leaves me she keys my car and said she met a guy at a bar awhile back.  We were together for over 8 years and all that happened in a few months.

Worse thing is that I shouldn't feel loss after she left me, but it hurts a year later still. |-|

|-| cnvowpe || 394 || My ex husband and I had been best friends for 7 years.  According to everyone we were soulmates.  Well we were madly in love and finally started dating, then moved in together, and after a year or so said our I dos.  One month after we were married he went out drinking with some friends.  He tried some cocaine...and that was it.  He became a severe alcoholic and drug addict.  He drained our accounts, stole every penny, destroyed our house, violently threatened me, and finally disappeared. ..then he overdosed and spent months in rehab only to continue his habit the minute he got out.  This sounds like a white trash love story right?  He was actually from a wealthy, upper class family, was endlessly kind and loyal to us, very well educated.  It was a complete shock to all of us with this behavior.  He is still a junkie to this day.  We were only married 8 months from I do to divorce day in court.  It still breaks my heart to this day. |-|

|-| cnvoxws || 3 || A Citgo gas station near my hometown. It was the day I turned 21, and I had been to the DMV to get my license renewed the day before. Now I had the old ID and the scannable paper that says I'm 21 and my license is valid until I get the new one mailed to me. 

I tried to buy a goddamn pack of cigarettes at the gas station after work and I was denied. This was from a lady who sold me cigarettes every few days for the previous few months. The scannable piece of paper and my previous ID count for a legal ID, but she wouldn't sell them to me, despite the fact that she had done so (without checking ID) a few days ago. 

I asked politely for the manager and she gave me a smug smile and pointed towards her fucking nametag. That was when I 'began verbally abusing her', according to the harassment complaint. I wasn't charged and the cops told me I was right, but I still was barred from the store.

People who think they can get by on public transportation and do everything in a day or so. It is definitely possible to use the bus and trains, but it'll take more than a day to see all the big attractions. It's nearly impossible to get to parts of the West Side by bus, and the buses often run late. It's not like New York or even San Francisco. 

Then the people who think they can see Joshua Tree, Yosemite, Sequoia, San Francisco, San Diego and LA all in a weekend. California is a huge state that can take weeks or even months to completely explore. I've lived here for fifteen years of my life and I've only scraped the surface of the things to do here. I found it much better to just dedicate your trip to one region/city and just come back a few times.

I stood outside the car certain I was about to get arrested and remembered I hadn't put my panties back on under my skirt which suddenly felt very awkward. After some questioning and scaring the shit out of us he asked us to leave and said if we were seen there again we would go to jail. I didn't risk it. Wasn't that nice of a park. There was no one there. That's what made it the perfect place for sex. It's been 8 years and I haven't been back.  |-| 
|-| cnvpcc9 || 5 || My mother's boyfriend before she met my father was insane. They went on one date and began stalking her after the break up. Fast forward 17 years, I'm 11 and find a letter in the mail. My mom immediately snatched it away from me. She proceeded to read it, alone, locked in her bedroom. I heard heart wrenching sobbing, but she never let me see it personally. One day, I snuck into my parents' room and found a shoebox FULL of these letters calling her every name in the book and saying how he's been watching my sister and i for our entire childhood. It was disgusting and ridiculously disturbing.

Through some investigative digging when I became older and learned to use a computer, I found out the man's name. I think I was about 15 at the time. I also found out that the man was found, in a ditch, beaten so badly he was forced into a coma. His legs were broken by a blunt object, and his face was so disfigured that he was apparently barely recognizable. He died shortly after.  
Then it started to make sense. The year this man was attacked, my father was supposedly traveling for work for a few weeks. I was fairly young at the time, and it didn't phase me since he traveled a few times a year. I can only assume that my father finally had enough of this psycho and lost his mind when the man mentioned my sister and i, and my father must have beaten this man into a coma and covered it up immediately with a "business trip."

I have never brought this up with them and don't want to ever know the truth.

After school, I was pulling out of the parking lot, which I was then met by another vehicle.  Speeding SUV, meet Neon driver door.  My door was caved in 18", and I was knocked out.  

While getting a few stitches above my eye, a doctor informed me of my fortune.  I should be dead.  Best case scenario, I should have lost the left side of my body.  

More fun to the story is that a girl has wanted me to give her a ride home for awhile.  Each time I refused her, but that day she offered a Twix for compensation.  Not one to turn down a good deal.  I agree to give her a ride... Only to total my car as soon as I pull out of the lot.

Another perspective.  Some friends heard the crash, and laughed about it until they realized it was my vehicle.  They ran over and put their hoodies on my lap and chest as they waited for medical assistance.  It was December, and I lost my window; they wanted to keep me warm.  Supposedly they asked how I was, and in my stupor, my only response was to glance up and let them know my sentiments and condition was "poop".

Tl;Dr girl gives me candy and gets in my car.  Immediately after, an assassin tries to murder me, but I can't be killed apparently.  Poop to that. |-|

2 weeks later we went back so he could buy something, I walked in like nothing happened (who would really remember me). I noticed employees talking and gesturing to me, and figured I was caught, but still slowly walked back to my favourite drum set. The same gentleman that "banned" me the first time approached me and ask "Didn't I ban you from coming back here!?" I told him yes but I was really sorry. He then apologized to me saying "It's my fault, if you want to play the drums, I shouldn't stop an inspiring rock star". He let me bang away until my brother got his stuff.

I asked what was wrong but got no straight answer.  I offered to call off the wedding, but she insisted that she loved me and wanted to stay with me.  We were married on Thanksgiving day.  On Christmas Eve, she admitted to cheating on me during our engagement.  I spiraled into a terrible dark depression.  We tried to make it work for about a year.  As my depression lifted, I realized that my resentment buried any love that I had for her.  She cheated again and I left her. |-|

|-| cnvpu72 || 20 || My first marriage lasted a year and a half. The only reason it lasted for that second "half" a year, was because California state law has an "are you sure" clause where you have to be separated at least six months.

I met him through Facebook. He was from Scotland and I'm Californian. We were both young (23 at the time), and wanted to carry on our relationship for more than a few weeks at a time. It was expensive to keep flying halfway across the world, so we decided to take the plunge.

It wasn't until we were married that I found out he was around £30,000 into debt with the Bank of Scotland before he jumped ship. Not only that, he was spending a lot of time driving around in my car to pick up high school girls while I was working. Of course, as the oblivious and dedicated wife, I didn't believe when people were telling me he was cheating; even from the women who were sleeping with him.

Not until years later, I found out that my brother's wife was telling me my husband was cheating on me because she was sneaking off with him on his "guy's weekend camp outs" to have an affair. I had gotten her a job, was helping pay her bills, and fully supporting my husband, which is why she felt so bad and tried to tell me.

Through the course of several months, he had gotten a job and never pitched in on the bills once. He was too busy spending all of his money on my brother's wife. The only thing that started giving me red flags was because he was getting Victoria's Secret catalogs, and I'm a size 16 (and I would not be caught dead wearing anything from Victoria's Secret).

His excuse later on was that I was a "couch potato" and didn't want to go on cycling trips with him. I worked at a golf course at the time, and went (horribly) golfing several times a year. Even for being fat, I was a waitress and banquet server, and ran my ass off for around 60+ hours a week. I also got into Final Fantasy XI at the time, waiting for him to come home from "work".

He had financed a $30,000 truck, got all the add-ons possible for it (which turned it into a $45,000 truck in my name, and tanked my credit), then took off to Missouri to try and marry the next sucker to keep him in the country. He knew he was going to debtor's prison, and to be honest, I hope he did.

Really, it was just all bad. It was ugly, I started talking to other men on the phone in front of his face near the end because of his neglect (which makes me not 100% innocent either), and just got done with the bullshit. 

Pro tip - Don't marry someone just because they're from a different country. The novelty wears off after awhile. |-|

In fifth grade, I knocked my sister Edie down the stairs and I blamed it on the dog…When my mom sent me to the summer camp for fat kids and then they served lunch I went nuts and I pigged out and they kicked me out…But the worst thing I ever done — I mixed a pot of fake puke at home and then I went to this movie theater, hid the puke in my jacket, climbed up to the balcony and then, then, I made a noise like this: hua-hua-hua-huaaaaaaa — and then I dumped it over the side, all over the people in the audience. And then, this was horrible, all the people started getting sick and throwing up all over each other. I never felt so bad in my entire life.’ |-| 
|-| cnvpyc6 || 8 || When I was in high school, there was this girl a few grades above me. I never met her. Never saw her. It wasn't obvious if she was a boy or a girl, through no doing of her own. Those were just the cards she was dealt. She was seeing a counselor at the school. Reason was, she suffered from bullying because of the way that she looked and stuff that was going on in her family. I don't know much more.

Well, one day at lunch she just signed herself out....went home and hung herself. I didn't know her but when I heard, I was floored. 

In the following days and weeks, the school organized a memorial assembly, they put out flowers and cards, a book that students could sign.

Best part....all those fucking assholes, those fucking leeches that were bullying her day in and day out, who made her life miserable, who tore her down...they were right there....fake fucking tears...signing shit for her family to read....participating in the assembly by reading poems, performing, etc. It was a fucking joke. They were doing it for their 15 minutes in front of the school.

I saw it as one final insult to her. It was honestly cringe-worthy. I felt so bad for her but I'd just gotten to that school. She was grades above me. I would have been a friend to her, if I could have. I'd have tried to be there. I know what it feels like. Except I was the opposite....I was just....invisible. 

It's been a while since this happened. Am now 21 but I still remember it. Hope you found your peace, Karen. Really hope you did.  |-|

You get paid big bucks to sit around chatting to planes and making sure the little green circles don't touch each other if the numbers next to the circles are the same. It's a big sky, there's lots of room. You also get unlimited sick days, work 36 hours a week, 6 weeks of leave a year. It is shift work because the planes are always flying but that isn't a big deal.

Best part of it all is that you can only do it when you're there. If you aren't plugged in there's no extra work you can take home to get that project done, or meet some deadline. When you're not at work you are completely mentally free to do whatever you please. |-|

|-| cnvqo4a || 21 || I can never go back to Kosovo.  Or Kosova, as the locals prefer; yes, the Serbian provence/UN protectorate/independent country.  This was after the war, and I was part of a UN delegation there for a couple of weeks doing evaluations on the rebuilding efforts.  We were brining in all sorts of equipment, tools, generators, cherry-pickers and shit like that to help out.

As you all know, Bill Clinton bombed the fuck out of the Serbians, earning the love of all Kosovars, to the extent that they named the main road "Bill Clinton Avenue" and they put up a big bronze statue of him right as you enter town from the airport. [A great bronze monstrosity of him waving to the city.](http://imgur.com/GOnkdtX)


So we were put up at the Grand Hotel in the center of town, and, upon arrival, I began my standard routine for getting my circadian rhythm on track with local time: heavy drinking.  I went down to the bar/restaurant, done in late '50s Soviet satellite sheik, and began consuming vodka, because I'm culturally sensitive like that.

One thing I can say about Prishtina was that the locals were friendly.  It wasn't half an hour before I was being offered speed, hookers and guns. Having no need for speed or hookers, and discovering that the guns were only being sold by the crate, I took my business to one of the shadier bars that was under an apartment complex.  

Walking down the steps, I was greeted with a bronze statue of a mermaid, tail bent under her like she was on her knees, her boobs pointing out and up, arms circling upward like she was holding an invisible sword up and her boobs polished bright and shiny in comparison to her duller, copper color.  I gave them a rub for good luck and went in.

I don't remember much about the place, except the hanging lights had red fringe shades on them, and there was a pool table, but when I went to get a drink, this dark-haired guy with a mustache started with the "Hey! American! Drink up, man! Girls, give him a drink!" shit, and was super sketchy, and I ignored him and put  €5 on the bar and asked for a beer.  Even at the airport, beer was  €3, so I figured I was safe.  Of course, skeezy asshole mustache man was the "owner" and when I tried to leave after 4 or 5 shitty Buds, I "owed" him  €300 for the "very special imported beer".  And for the pool games I played, as he explained later.  I told him to fuck off and made for the door, but got tripped up and held down by two more fucks with thin, sculpted facial hair.  This is when he told me about the rental fee for the pool cue.

So I was too drunk to fight, my wallet only had about  €50 in it, but I had my ATM card.  They marched me outside to get money from the machine, and things get hazy at this point, all hell broke loose. I remember the huge, bearded face, attached to proportionaly huge and hairy body. Whatever other qualities this man may have had; love of art, a chess master, a builder of model houses, the two words you could NOT leave out are big and follicled. His hands and knuckles had hair, and probably blood, on them because he had just knocked those two assholes the fuck out.  "They did this to some of my guys, too," he said, "came to teach a lesson, guess you were the next stupid fuck on the list."  Like I said, things got choppy, but we talked as he steered me back towards the bar, I got nothing from him but the name "Josh" and the distinct impression that he was a trained killing machine.

I've been around a TON of military guys the last 10 years, in my job, and he had the military restraint, which I usually see when some officer has to show the "specialist", me, around, but this guy had jet-black, wiry, brillo hair to his shoulders, and when we went back into the bar, a grim, set way of destroying everything in the place.  Not regulation.  Nice guy, though. Mostly.

The owner got a punch in the liver and the bartender (and the bar whores) went out the back.  I sat down in a chair and watched him grab the waist-high mini-fridge behind the bar, lift it up with one hand, carry it over to the pool table and slam it down on top of it.   Then he punctured the ammonia coils in the fridge with a knife from the bar, draining that shit all over the pool table, then he gathered up every bottle and can, making several trips (I did ask for, and receive, several beers during this process, and continued readjusting my body clock) and broke them over the pool table.  He ripped up the lampshades and, took a dump on the bar, but he was joking around with me the whole time.  Most fun I've ever had, I grab a bottle, take a swig, then throwing it at the pool table.  The stereo was the last thing we destroyed.  I passed out a bit and woke up looking at the bronze mermaid going up the steps.

He was dragging the fucking statue out the door.  By him fucking self.  This was easily 500kg of metal.  He was determined to fuck up everything this dude owned.  I was impressed, but also had a Vestil forklift with a telescoping boom out behind the hotel, for a demonstration tomorrow.  A few minutes later, we were driving off down the road with a mermaid dangling from the forks of our ride like we had gone fishing in Dali land.


[This is sort of what we were drunk-driving.](http://i.imgur.com/g53VHKq.jpg)


It was late, and I was REALLY drunk at this point when we rounded the corner and saw Bill.  I wasn't driving straight, I couldn't have told you the name of my firstborn or what year it was, but the instant I saw the statue of Clinton I went Rainman.  In my mind, I saw how the puzzle fit together.  The upraised, encircled arms of the mermaid fit perfectly over the waiving arm, and, after some careful lowering down, they kept her face pressed firmly against his crotch as they pressed against his back like a some weird Greek sex fable.

Josh rode back with me to the hotel, made sure I got to my room, and vanished.  The next morning, I got fired.  And thrown out the country.  I guess being the only motherfucker with a forklift in town narrows down the suspect pool pretty quickly.  I was taken to the UN compound, reamed by by boss over speakerphone in a room full of MPs, then taken directly to the airport where my bags, which I hadn't even unpacked, were waiting.  I didn't get to sit out in the lounge, but was in the security area.  With the mustache owner, who was also being deported.

So yeah, can't ever to back to Kosovo.  I found out later they put a tarp around it, claiming "repairs" and it took them a day to get someone who could get the mermaid off (!!) without scarring the statue of Clinton.

Never did see Josh again.  If you're out there, I owe you a beer or three. |-|

Creepy as hell when you're a kid, can't move and can't scream. Luckily they stopped after awhile. |-| 
|-| cnvr7k7 || 3 || So far 3 people that I know of have died from my high school, and I graduated 3 years ago. One had cancer and another was speeding on his motorcycle on a busy suburban street and t boned another car at 55mph in a 30mph zone. He survived long enough to make it to the hospital but died at the hospital.  When I was going through one of my yearbooks i noticed that both of them were in the same 5 person row of one of the year books. As for the third I know he died but I do not know how. I suspect drugs were involved.

Edit: there was a 4th. He committed suicide. |-| 
|-| cnvr818 || 4 || The very popular quarterback on the senior football team. He had a heart condition and kept it a secret (otherwise they wouldn't have let him play on the team).

She has no idea I know this (another friend who she confided in told me) and I would never let her know that I know.  They went to some counselling and are still together (it has been about 6 years now since this happened) and have two kids.  I really wish I didn't know.  Haha |-|

|-| cnvrdse || 5 || My aunt. So she was in the air force, and married a guy she had met fairly recently. A beautiful wedding ensues, big money spent. They have a daughter together and months after that, they are divorced.

About 6 years later, my aunt marries another man, who she has a son with, and then divorces after I believe a year. These are open people too, bot closed people that revealed new character traits after marraige.

After this, she dates a man for about a decade, he is more part of the family than any of the others. That relationship ends because, after her daughter looks up her father, my aunt eventually falls back in love with her first husband, and months later, the two are married. This time, he lives in North Carolina and her in New jersey, so that's the most likely reason that they were divorced about a year later.

This past Christmas, her second husband was at my grandparents house with her. Maybe they'll get married again. 

All I know is that I will never take advice from that woman, she is probably the worst decision maker in the world, let alone the fact that she may also be the worst mother as well. Her daughter is now 30 and is about to get married, and I'd bet money they get divorced. |-|

I told myself things were wacky because we were both under tons of stress. She lost her job (where she was making almost twice as much as me per hour) two months after the wedding and refused to get another one. So here I am, trying to support us on $8.75/hour. She always drank a lot, but started drinking even more. She got mean and nasty, and everything just spiraled out of control. We got married in September. She moved out in April. There's more to the story, but this is long enough as it is.  |-|

|-| cnvrno2 || 5 || I divorced my now ex-wife after 8 months. We had been together for just under 8 years before we got married.

I found a STI test results form from planned parenthood in her purse (clean luckily). She was trying to make it as an actress and had gotten her first professional gig in another part of the country. While there she'd slept with one of her co-stars without using protection.

Nearly 4 years earlier she had cheated on me while we were going through a rough time in university. I was incredibly distant and she found someone else for about a month or 2. We worked through that, but the habit had been formed. It turns out that over the next 4 years leading up to our marriage she had occasionally slept with different people.

What I thought was a 1 off bad decision turned out to be a habit for dealing with her anxiety regarding her career, life, relationship etc. I realized then and there that this would never end AND that she was absolutely willing to put my and her health at risk while doing it.

Why did I go through with it? Because I thought we were rock-solid and in love. Why did she go through with it only to cheat 7 months later? I don't know. She imploded her whole life and currently survives by mooching off her parent's retirement funds while none of our mutual friends (e.g. basically all of her friends) won't speak to her anymore.

Seems like a terrible idea to me, but I couldn't tell you what she was thinking, or if she was. |-|

On top of that you would always be known as the creepy bowling ball guy. People would think you are truly obsessed about them and call the people from Hoarders on you. That would make a terrible episode. 

Plus if have a cat, lets face it I love my cats, but they dumb. They would always try to climb them in the middle of the night and end up knocking them over and create a horrible cacophony right as you are almost asleep every night.

I'll get arrested if I go back to a certain Life Saving club. They banned me cause I spoke to the news paper about the negligence of the officals handling the ocean event which they sent the very kids we were meant to protect into conditions they couldn't handle and deemed not safe, officals ignored us who were in full uniform on patrol they did it anyway against our warning not to. Kid gets knocked out by board goes under drowned. Officals don't even get charged man slaughter, autopsy covered up, they banned members speaking out.

I was one of them banned for life, but they also threaten I wasn't allowed on the sand. Club I can understand but they don't own the sand or water. So that's laughable.

Life Saved for that club, got 187.4 Voluntary hours. Stand for the kid who died and against the corruption in Surf Life Saving Australia so banned me 2 weeks later. |-|

|-| cnvs1kp || 6 || I'm about to divorce more than likely and I got married in April. I lived with my husband a year and half before we married but when we married we got our own place. Boy the lack of roomates apparently meant he didnt have to save face and he went crazy with his temper.. Over and over and over.. When the cops came I moved to another part of la on my own. He knew he did me wrong and hated the "monster" he was, he went to therapy and we went to therapy and he swore to never raise his voice again and he really didn't....

And then

He got drunk


And twisted my arm... And squeezed my wrists trying to inflict pain and it did.

I said awe hell naw and I'm about to file for divorce. He is a foreigner so in order to keep him here I have to wait until after our green card interview. One part of me wants to kick him out for being an alcoholic asshole. The other part of me says.. Well his baby should meet dad.. If he goes he won't be back for ten years for visa violation. I'm happy to be a single mom. My goal has always been kids before thirty regardless of whether there was a father or sperm donation clinic. I was not and will not wait, I have a career etc and plenty of resources to raise good kids on my own.

But I dont want to make a ten year commitment yet so I am waiting to file because of the green card interview. We dont live together anymore anyways, and now he won't be staying here much if at all ever... So no big deal


When I divorce I will file for required alchohol tests before seeing baby regularly. Because my crazy mom was an alcoholic, I won't let my kid anywhere near someone who is.

He claims he will spend ten years not drinking rather than not see his kid. I have a feeling it will last ten weeks. I have some sympathy for alcoholics but not even a little time to spare for them.

I had not realized he was truly out of control till that night. I truly believed he could drink responsibly and though we had fought about it before it always ended me saying "try drinking responsibly"

Well no problem I hopefully will have a kid with all his good parts cause I will raise it well and without any drugs or alcohol or violence or yelling. We both were raised in those environments so I know he understands the depth of my desire to have baby not be exposed to it.

So we shall see! Divorce filing in a few months I'll let you know how it goes hah!

|-| cnvs39e || 3 || When it was legal in JP I was highly, highly, highly addicted to "spice", also known is "Incense" and "Legal Herb".  
Basically, synthetic pot.  
in reality - it's nothing like pot. Not even close.  
An old friend of mine who is in recovery for various substances tried it once and was like,  
"Oh, I know what this is."  
when I asked her what she thought it was (she tried it on a whim - she's in full control of her recovery and just taking a puff of something wouldn't cause her to relapse) she responds,  
"Crack. You're smoking fucking *crack*, you idiot."  
It made me feel very ashamed. That shit *is* crack.  
It makes you super, super, super high and paranoid for about 20 minutes and then super low right after meaning you want to smoke some more right away - kind of like cocaine.  
I used to do it a lot because it was like dynamite in my mind. It would give me tons of ideas for creative writing, made playing video games more immersive and was something I could use to pass the time alone.  
When you smoke too much or you run out, you turn into a monster.  
it's honestly pretty horrific and I'd caution everyone away from it.

We were married just shy of two and half years.

I was an asshole.  We were living together for about 9 months beforehand and my boss suggested we get married.  I would get a serious pay raise being in the military.  During this period of time she was looking to move out and end the relationship.  I convinced her this was what was best.

We got married at a court house in december and didn't tell any of our families (and to be honest, I still haven't actually ever told my parents.  They knew.  I knew they knew.  It just went unspoken.  Even during the I am getting divorced conversations)

Throughout the relationship it would swing from really good to really bad.  I was manipulative and hot/cold with her.  I spent sometime in a mental hospital less than a year into it after having a breakdown where I was having homicidal ideations towards her for no reason (never hit her or hurt her, just imagined it).  Got out and was stablized on medications, I eventually stopped taking.

This ended my military career and in the process of dealing with getting out I was paralyzed in anxiety.  This entire time we had never learned how to communicate properly.  I didn't know what she needed, even if she told me because I didn't listen.  She didn't know to speak to me the way I wanted to be and to push me.  Again this is probably my fault.

Eventually she left me.  As she probably should have done in the first place. I am leaving out lots of other shitty things I did.  I don't see myself as a bad person and I wasn't purposefully doing anything malicious towards her.  I thought this was normal. I don't think she was entirely blameless but I feel like I deserve the lion's share of blame.

The good news? After the divorce happened and I spent a lot of time reflecting on what I did wrong and acknowledging the mistakes to myself. Something I hadn't bothered to do while married.  When she left me, I was blindsided.  I thought things were fine.  I have since had a couple of healthy relationships and I feel like I have learned from the mistakes of my past.

We haven't spoke since the divorce.  I moved out of state before it ever finalized. After reflecting on how much of an insufferable asshole I was, I considered sending her a letter to apologize.  Although the version she knew of me would probably see this as some sort of self-gratifying act.  So I figure it's best to let her succeed and not try to stir up previous drama.  She was a smart girl so she's probably doing well in whatever she's doing. |-|

|-| cnvsyie || 24 || I come from a family of addicts, so I have made a conscious effort to avoid alcohol and nicotine products (I'll drink occaisionally, but it's in the realm of a few drinks maybe twice a year. It's too expensive for me anyway cuz I'm a total heavyweight).

But I still ended up with an addiction. Diet Coke. Everyone I've ever known who prefers Diet Coke drinks way too much of it, myself included, and skipping even one day feels like hell. On school days I could wind up having three or more 20oz bottles a day - I had to have one for every class period, to do my homework. I'd get twitchy if I didn't have one. I realized just how similar it was to smoking when I realized I could say I had a half-pack a day habit (a 12-pack of cans), and that their CokeRewards system is not unlike the Marbolo point system that my mom used back in the day to get jackets and backpacks and stuff.

I've managed to go over a month Diet Coke free. Mainly because it finally started destroying my stomach and made me sick anytime I drank it. Drinking too much of it also would make my head so fuzzy I couldn't think by the end. It was really scary, honestly. |-|

|-| cnvt7tj || 12 || 6 months here. Not 6 months to the divorce, but 6 months to the split up.

There were a few reasons.

1, I was in school (college), and my ex got pregnant. Given the rent where we lived at the time it made financial sense for us to get an apartment on campus, but that wasn't possible without being married.

2, We were both young. We had met, fallen in infatuation, told ourselves we loved each other madly, we were soulmates, etc. All the stuff you say when you're young and you have no. fucking. clue. what love really is. We both came from families where our dads had recently (less than 10 years previously, adding to the weight of our already angsty mid-teen years) left, we were right around the same age when it happened, we were still stinging from it. We had so much pain in common that it bonded us, but it never occurred to us that it wasn't love. 

And at that point, with your father having "recently" left your mother, you're going to say "I'm never going to do that to the person I love." So you stay with the person, even though you don't really love them anymore, if you ever did in the first place. You agree, because you don't want to inflict that pain on someone else, to make this commitment that you don't fully comprehend until you're in it. 

But then you _are_ in it. You're looking at someone you don't really love, and you're looking at them every day, and you're slowly but surely building up a resentment towards them because they've trapped you in this life you don't want for yourself, and you're stuck but you don't see a clear, painless way out. So you start to do stupid shit. You spend more time away from the apartment, hanging with your friends, doing the stupid shit that younger people like to do when they want to do stupid shit. And the responsibility and the commitment is still sitting there in the corner of your eye, gnawing at you and causing your resentment to build up even more. So then you start taking it out on them. Your temper becomes shorter with them, you spend a lot of time yelling when you are home, and you find more excuses just to get away from home, because you don't even want to look at them and be reminded. As if you need to look at them to be reminded. 

And eventually it boils over.

I'm not talking about physically boiling over, though I can't say I didn't come close a few times - in my mind, that is. I never threatened her or hit her.

But it boils over, and the blowouts come, and you're sitting there, realizing that you don't want to be with her any more. She's leaving you because you're always angry and you don't pay enough attention to her, and you're fine with it because you're so pissed off at her for anything little but you're probably most angry because way down deep inside, you're really breathing a huge sigh of relief.

I honestly don't know if she had the same feelings about the situation that I had. I will readily admit that I did not see this then as I see it now, and that it's really only in recent years that I've been more introspective and honest about what happened. I think she felt the same way, though if you were to ask her she would tell you I broke her heart, that it was all my doing. I see it, through my own admittedly skewed perspective, as a mutual situation. I wouldn't call her the most self-aware person, something many would agree to. But I'll never really know. Can't say I care anymore. 

So listen, if you're still reading and you want my advice, if you want to get out but are afraid because you think it'll be painful, I PROMISE YOU that leaving now IS the most painless way out.

|-| cnvtqkf || 5 || It's not exactly a "secret", but I would never tell my mom that she's the main root to my problems as an adult. She's the reason for my severe anxiety, depression, (most of) my trust issues, and clinically diagnosed agoraphobia. She contributed to the reason I had no real childhood. Instead of being outside playing with friends, I was inside at the bathroom door begging her to come out and not kill herself. My anxiety/agoraphobia comes from years of her publicly humiliating me either on purpose to "teach me a lesson" or because she couldn't control her own manic outbursts. Now my fear of public humiliation is so intense, it's paralyzed me. I'm easily controlled by people once they learn the trick is to throw a little guilt trip because my mom was the Queen of them. 

I would never tell her this because she's gotten help and is better now, but that doesn't fix my childhood and my mental issues caused by mostly her. 

I would never tell my dad that the reason I'm so uncomfortable with affection is mostly because his lack of showing it toward us when we were kids. 

Don't get me wrong, my parents loved me and I always had food and clean clothes and a roof over my head. But they damaged us quite a bit emotionally. 

Men, if you're reading this and you have kids.. Hug them. Always hug them. Don't let them turn 33 and be incredibly uncomfortable at even just the thought of hugging you. If you have a daughter, hug her and tell her you love her and that she's beautiful. Always. If you have a son, hug him and tell him you love him and that he's a handsome, good young man.

|-| cnvu1t1 || 3 || Met my ex when I was 20 and at a different college from her. We dated for seven years during which time I got a degree and a job, and she got two degrees including her law degree. Most of our relationship for the first seven years was long distance.  Her parents lived 100 miles from mine and our schools when we met were 180 miles apart. Once I started working (2 years before she graduated law school), I got a job about 170 miles from her parents house (where she lived until we got married). Long distance was awesome. We'd see each other about every other weekend during the semesters, and for a week or two straight at various times in the summers and holidays. Great sex, loved spending time with her and just being a couple. 

Before we got married I could tell she was going to have anxiety moving to my town 170 miles away from her parents, so I made the offer to quit my job and let her support me with her law career while I went back to school. She had a standing offer to work at the law office she interned with when she graduated. So I finished work, and she took the bar a few days before the wedding. 

Once we moved in to an apartment together after the wedding things changed. I had lived with roommates before but never with someone in such close quarters. After one semester of school I decided I hated school, called my old job and started working from home for them 170 miles away. I was not an easy person to live with and after about 14 or 15 months she had had enough of my shit and moved out. I wasn't violent, and I was not abusive verbally by putting her down or anything like that. I loved her and she was the most beautiful girl in the world to me. I was an angry person though. I was miserable being isolated alone all day working remote, and I had a bad temper. I yelled a lot. I remember when I first told my parents we were getting divorced and my mom said something like "Well, honey, all that yelling is hard to be around." 

It's been over 19 years since the separation and I still miss her. I've been with my current girlfriend for just over 11 years, and there were couple before the current one, but nothing compares to that first love. Six or seven years ago when Facebook was starting to blow up, I looked up the ex and blocked her, blocked all her family, and blocked all of her friends. I did the blocking so I'll never be tempted to see how she's doing. We live about 250 miles apart and are for all intents and purposes dead to one another.  |-|

|-| cnvvfhd || 8 || I'm an authority on this one, but I feel I should make a few notes first:

"most addictive" is highly dependent on "most acceptable" and "most accessible."

I started out smoking weed. That was fun, but not super-addictive, as it often made me anxious/socially inept. 

After high school, I was into opiates. Those were highly addictive but incredibly demonized. You can't just walk around saying you love morphine. People think that's pretty messed up (and it is). Opiates are super addictive but hard to get and basically taboo. I eventually quit for my own reasons, but probably would have in the long run just out of social pressure. 

From there, I went to college. I popped adderall because I friend on my floor had a seemingly infinite supply. That shit's easily as bad as opiates, though I didn't realize it at the time; I thought it was just a sort of "study aid." No. I got hooked on it and had terrible, mind-wrecking withdrawals that made me desperately depressed when I quit. 

So, I'd quit weed, quit adderall, quit opiates; what I had left was the legal stuff, and yes, I'd been doing it for a while. I'd been dipping since I was 17 and smoking cigarettes (not simultaneously--I chose smokes over dip) since 22. I'd been drinking off and on since 18. Now, after quitting all illegal substances, I found myself smoking cigarettes and drinking. 

These are the vices that have stuck with me. I quit smoking 10 days ago, cold turkey, and am holding strong. I'm down to drinking around 10 days/month, but I still drink FAR too much compared to the average American on those days. I am 5 16 oz. Keystone Ice's deep right now and could easily do handstands, tapdance, etc.

Alcohol is indisidious in college. For those of us who grew up self-medicating, it becomes the ultimate acceptable vice. We're expected to be shitfaced. Being shitfaced leads to new friends, new girls, new experiences, adventures, fun times, laughter. For a somewhat-introverted person, alcohol is the ultimate release. I had more insane adventures while blacked-out drunk in my freshman year than I care to relate here, and I have to admit that I don't regret it. 

For that reason, I think alcohol is (or at least can be) the most addictive legal substance, aside from caffeine/sugar (these are so insidious that we barely realize we are addicted; alcohol, at least, makes you admit it). I could get drunk nightly in college and still hit near to a 4.0. Getting drunk made me funnier and happier. I made new friends. I got laid. I had adventures. 

It's hard as hell for me to admit a drinking problem, because our society sees drinking black and white. Either you drink "for fun" or you're a complete fucking wreck of a human being. I'm somewhere between; I drink alone, but can go weeks sober. I drink too much, but never to the point of vomiting, drunk driving or violence. I don't really enjoy drinking that much anymore, but compulsively do so, anyhow. 

But society tells me that either A) I am a fun guy who can hold his liquor and drinks beer at sporting events/etc. or B) I am a shell of a human who has a serious problem and must give it up to God. 

It's not the substance that makes alcohol so addictive, it's the fucked-up culture. It's like: if I give alcohol up completely, I'll never be seen as the "fun" guy again. People will think I'm irreparably damaged and incapable of moderation. On the flipside, if I don't give up alcohol completely, people will think I'm *just having fun* or *partying it up* when *I* know I'm actually struggling with an addiction. 

I can moderate and have moderated a TON in the past couple years, during which time I've also quit smoking cold turkey (a whole other can of worms I won't get into, societally speaking). But nobody glorifies a smoker anymore. Nobody thinks it's cool. Nobody says "bro, just have one smoke with me" or "dude, we're gonna go get so smoked out on tobacco." 

With alcohol, we only seem to endorse complete abstinence or complete indulgence. Real moderation is something that I know is possible but that is difficult to achieve, at least for me, and I see few people encouraging it. I'd love to be able to have one beer after work, but right now, I have a hard time not drinking six. At the same time, I can not drink for weeks or months without issue. 

Alcohol is the worst, at least in America. It's insanely popular, glorified, available and forgivable. It's societally treated as a not-even-guilty pleasure and also a horrible sin. For those of us who struggle with a normal relationship with it, there's no middle ground. Either we're complete alcoholics or we're complete teetotalers, even when we can go weeks without it but struggle with not opening another beer once drinking again. 

TL;DR: Done a lot of drugs. Alcohol's the toughest to make sense of, at least in America.  |-|

I go to her house and knock on her door to see if she is coming out to hang. Nobody answers so I knock again. I notice the TV is on in the front room so I know someone is in. I look at the sofa opposite and she is getting slammed in missionary by her boyfriend. (Un)fortunately, this didn't kick start any voyeurism fetish.

I walked away laughing. Like belly laughing because I couldn't believe what I had seen. I immediately went to meet my friend and told him. I have since told a few of my friends, some who went to university with her, and she hasn't a clue.

In fact, later in the night I bumped into her and told her I had knocked earlier. She said she must not have heard. I tell her the TV was on, maybe that drowned out the sound of my knock. She looked embarrassed but agreed.  |-|

He took it from her without telling her so she wouldn't be able to erase anything.

Good news is we have no evidence that she has his any money from him.

Bad news is she is cheating on him with at least 4 different guys, often in the form of a gangbang. it seems the 5 of them are in some sex ring thing where they talk in group messages about sex and get each other off reliving their sex sessions. One she sent them said "thanks for the cumbath" which is fucking crazy because she is the type to get so offended by cursing and is super religious. All we know about the guys is they work at a car dealership and she met one of them on Craigslist. We assume he introduced her to the rest. 

We haven't told him anything yet because we don't know what the fuck to do honestly.

|-| cnvxpd7 || 4 || TL;DR Accidentally found out that my straight-arrow, Catholic dad definitely cheated on my mom and was interested in experimenting with men.

I found out that my dad cheated on my mom for several years with another woman when I was younger, I think from when I was 6 to 10 or 11, and also that he was possibly bi-sexual. I knew the woman, who was one of his serious long-term high school/young adult girlfriend's little sister that had always had a crush on him. I wasn't snooping, but my dad left a fucking detailed conversation about it up on the computer and it was there when I woke it up from the screensaver to check my email while I was home doing laundry one weekend. He'd already gone to bed and knew I was home. My mom is not a computer person, has never used one and doesn't want to, so he wasn't worried about her seeing it. I asked him about the cheating part and he acted like I was nuts and said he didn't know what I was talking about: "Uncle [Name] must be playing a joke on me or something. I don't know anything about that." It was way too detailed and personal for anyone but him to have written those things, no one else was home, and he never acknowledged it again or acted any differently after I asked him--he drank pretty heavily in the evenings after work, which I didn't realize until years later. I'm thinking he might not remember that conversation and I never tried to discuss it again because it wouldn't have been helpful for anyone. He and my mom were already like roommates and were admittedly staying married because it was just easier than messing with a divorce. If my dad had lived longer he probably would've eventually moved into our second house and just stayed legally married, but he died 3.5 years ago. He wasn't the type to lie to me if I asked a question (at least not sober), especially since their pseudo-marriage was common knowledge at this point, which is why I don't think he remembered me asking and thus didn't know that I knew. I've never discussed it with my mom either, because I don't think she knew (*definitely* not about his new interest in experimenting with men) and she's already bitter enough. But we'll never know…


**Side note to anyone else who has found out shit like this about your parents:** It blew my mind and made me sick a little bit, but ultimately it didn't change how I felt about my dad. Our parents all have sides to them that would shock the hell out of us, but that doesn't change their love for you or undo everything good they have done and taught you. My dad was not a great husband in his later years, but they did have many happy years and he was an amazing dad. He told me and showed me literally every day that he loved me and was proud of me. I got random letters and cards telling me these things, or emails sent at all times of the day. Most often it was phone call just to say hi, I love you, and I'm proud of you. "Have I told you lately how proud I am of you and how much I love you?" He disciplined me consistently and fairly when I was younger, and implicitly trusted me because I earned that trust by not doing anything wrong. I never acted out or rebelled in high school and we rarely fought because I had pretty much no rules except for academic standards--no curfew, a credit card he paid for, a car and constant gas money, not allowed to have a real job, the works--and I appreciated and valued his trust and respect even though in theory I should've been a total brat. Everything he gave me was with the reminder, "I feel like you deserve XYZ because you've always been a good kid and you work really hard. If you ever decide to stray from that path then all these nice things are gone." He doted on and fucking cherished my brother and me, and couldn't say no to anyone else in need. As much as my mom frustrated him, he still literally *made* her go get a physical because she hates going to doctors and hadn't been in several years. He once stopped to move a turtle across a busy road. He jump-started strangers cars and paid people's bills if they forgot their wallets or came up short at the checkout counter. But if my husband were to ever treat me how he treated my mom and didn't want to seek counseling to improve it, I would absolutely leave him. It's okay to love your mom or dad as your parent even if they made mistakes in other areas of life. I didn't understand this until it actually happened, but don't do anything rash if you find out something crazy about your parents. At least sleep on it and make an educated choice about your relationship with them.  |-| 
|-| cnvycq7 || 3 || Im pretty much late for this and I think this would be buried but here I go.

Few monts ago, November to be precise. The school experienced something that was not supoosed to happen. One of my best friend died. It was unexpected really, as we were really close to each other even if we are not classmates and almost talk every day. Us group of friends would play dota2 and skype all day and all night, we didnt know what to feel when we really knew he was gone. It was around their PE playing ball and he felt uneasy and decided to take a rest on one of our kiosks just outside the gym (This is an open gym). We have no idea why but he just "stopped breathing" maybe it was cardiac arrest or something. The first day was pretty rough, as I walked through the halls which contained the classrooms of our Senior batch , It was VERY quiet and peaceful, our Senior batch are pretty tight knit to each other so we knew everyone pretty well. Few days passed and we celebrated his bday on friday at his funeral. Almost all of our batchmates came which crowded the whole place. Anyways it was the moment when we said our last goodbyes to him and bid farewell to everyone as it was like 11 in the evening. Up to this day the four of us would still play dota2 often but not as much as we did when we were 5. He was a very religious guy and most of all the best captain in our team. We miss you dude. |-|

Magic: the Gathering. 

Yes there are budget decks, yes there are ways to cheapen your buy in, but regardless, it still has an expensive buy in, especially dependent on format. Standard has sets rotating every year, so you will have to purchase cards to keep yourself playing in that format.

Enter Modern, where you can play these cards again, however, it has cards from 9th onwards, so there's a much larger card pool, and leads to much stronger decks, and much more money. There are cheap entry decks (40-150), but many competitive decks can easily hit 800+. I know a deck known as Jund easily hit over 1k. Also, this format is victim to hard ban list hits. A couple of days ago, one of the best decks lost their key card (RIP Birthing Pod players) and as a result, you can be out several hundred dollars.

Legacy is modern but every card is legal (except for a banlist). There are more cards that allow for even more powerful decks, and unfortunately, due to the existence of the reserve list, many high powered staples are not going to be reprinted, and these staples run at high high prices.

MTG is expensive, BUT, you could always just play pauper or just play commons with your friends. Just tournament level Is definitely more pricey. 

(If anyone wants to get into any format, I can recommend budget decks for you! :)) |-|

I still have it somewhere in my garage. Every now and then I hatch a plan to transplant actual RC plane giblets in there and turn it into something worth flying. Then I remember that RC helicopters are much more interesting than RC planes... |-|

|-| cnx7isi || 7 || My grandpa had a large collection of Lionel Model Trains from pre and post war.  His dad even saved them from a fire in their apartment in Hell's Kitchen back in the 30s, when they lost everything else but the trains.  Before my grandpa died in 2006 when I was 8, he gave me all his trains because I really liked them.  The wiring was shot and we couldn't afford to repair them, plus my dad didn't want them in the apartment so he put them in storage.  Sure enough, basement of our building floods, trains get ruined.  What my father didn't know was that Lionel's, especially prewars, are very easy to restore and these trains were worth $5,000+ because they were rare.  My dad threw them out.  Fast forward 6 years, it's 2012 and I was down in the storage closet.  Sure enough, I found a Lionel 6057 red caboose, built in the late 50s and only worth about $20-30.  But it renewed my interest.  I also found a boxcar that had been wrapped up to give to me for Christmas '02 from my grandpa, but my dad hated the trains and hid it from me.  Since my dad left us in 2007, nobody argued when I bought a 5 x 9 foot piece of plywood to start a layout.  For Christmas I got a Pennsylvania flyer starter set from my mom, and for my birthday I got the Santa Fe Super Chief set with money I had saved.  I got a job the next summer and the money I wasn't using to help make ends meet I used for the trains and for replacement parts for our car.  Fast forward to 2015, and I have a small city of MTH buildings and lionel trains.  I'm gonna build a suspension bridge and wire it with LEDs in the next few months.  My grandpa would be proud of my work.

Then, for my 10th birthday, I got it.  

The tumbler.  

I'm pretty sure angels sang.

Then I turned it on.  Once.  
Ever sat next to a cement truck going full-bore and thought "wow, my kid would find this soothing"?  Ya, neither is a rock tumbler.  I polished one set of rocks, with it running in our detached garage, and never again.  |-|

Also I never learned music in that class despite being in it for 3 years.

Oh, and when we were examined, she had everyone play a piece simultaneously - I faked it every time. Never blew into my recorder and still got got one of the highest grades in the class.

EDIT: Oh yeah I forgot, one time someone pressed the drum machine button on their keyboard mid way through one of her rants and left it on, that was pretty hilarious.

Oh, she also kicked a kid out of the class because she didn't like his hair cut.  |-|

5 year old me, I like to think was a sweet kid. I loved everything Disney! Still do actually but that's neither here or there. Here, however is a pic of me back then just to paint the true picture of heartbreak.

http://i.imgur.com/JHmEib1.png

Now, come six years old, mom and pops break up. Pops, as it goes was doing the dirty with my best friends mum. Controversial, right? You're darn right on that note.

Anywho I digress. If I recall this was near the start of the year? However I could be wrong, but come Christmas time there's only one thing I 100% want and literally need in life.

Buzz Fucking Lightyear of Star Command. 

The real life action figure from Toy Story of course, karate chop action, blinking laser, helmet that literally does the cool WHOOOOSH thing.

I loved Buzz, and I loved the idea of having Buzz in my life.

Now, my dad wanted to be on close terms with mom and me after cheating so he offered her to take care of Buzz for me, mom was going through financial hardships so happily accepted this proposal. 


So come Boxing day, and it's the day I get Buzz, right?

Well unfortunately the title of this post isn't "What is the one toy you desperately wanted as a kid and DID receive" (check again in a few hours on that note though). There was no Buzz. :(

More heartbreak though.

My dad, got Buzz Lightyear for my best friend, the son of the person he cheated on mom with. I was devastated.

I'm 24 now. Still have a big Buzz shaped hole in my heart. :'( |-|

She tried to fail me despite me doing my work, my mom had to come in and slap down a huge stack of finished work in front of the principal to show I did anything. Even then he wouldn't do anything to the teacher because they were friends. After fighting for a few months she finally managed to get me moved to a different teacher.

Sadly, I couldn't even make noise on the real trumpet. My cheeks puffed out to an unimaginable size, but no sound came out of the bell. Dejected, I gave up on my childhood dream, and tried the saxophone instead.

My brother plays trumpet now. I'm still a little miffed. |-|

Luckily I didn't have to deal with him until college.

He was a philosophy professor and he pretty much admitted he decided to make my life a living hell. My face apparently just pissed him off and he started teaching classes in a way to try to piss me off-like, present topics that he though would anger me. I had a gender concentration and we were suddenly subjected to the evils of modern feminism, shit like that.

Keep in mind, I didn't like him much either but I was smart enough to know that I needed to finish the course and GTFO so I was trying to fly under the radar in this couse. I wasn't exactly grandstanding. 

This isn't something I'm saying as paranoia. I ended up filing complaints with my advisors and having this actually looked into. My grades were suddenly higher at the end of the class too-turns out my face pissed him off enough that my grades were being suppressed.

Tl;dr there's hating a student and then there's hating a student so much that you turn into some weird academic Terminator. |-|

Because I was actually right-hand dominant and had been doing everything the hard way for the two some years I knew how to write. She was really kind of stern about it and it was even more baffling to six year old me because the OTHER left-handed students in the class got to use lefty scissors.

Mission success. I swapped to right handedness with only minor dyslexia and writing and such became magically much easier.

(I had sat across from my older brother and copied him exactly - meaning as he was right handed, that I used my left hand, which is why I was a lefty to begin with. My mom, being ambidextrous, saw me using my left and encouraged it. Kindergarten teacher assumed I was a lefty because I was using my left. First grade teacher finally noticed that I used my right hand for *literally everything else* and forced me to switch. Not that I appreciated it at the time.) |-|

She was a nasty, cruel woman who would yell and scream for no real reason. If our cursive wasnt clear enough, if we werent astutely paying attention to whatever she was talking about, if we laughed or joked around with our classmates in anyway, we got yelled at or put out in the hall. She called my mom about mine and many students' behavior so many times none of the parents ever really took it seriously. They knew her deal. Second grade wasnt a fun experience. 

About 15 years later I was frequently hooking up with this girl that I met at a college party. We fucked like rabbits for a few weeks.  By an act of serendipity, she turned out to be Mrs. Galonis' granddaughter.

|-| cnx9ij5 || 1894 || I never thought I'd get a chance to share this story on Reddit!

The worst teacher I ever had was in 5th grade.

Backstory:

In 5th grade my family had fallen apart. I repeated the year, even. I had a lot of trouble focusing in school. My dad had came out of the closet and was in the midst of a psychological breakdown, when he met someone online and moved in with him, and took me with him. So I was living with 3 gay men, sleeping in their office on a cot, and all my worldly possessions were in a box. The other two men were nice enough, but I wasn't their kid, and they'd never had kids, so they weren't the best parental figures.

On top of that, my mother, devastated by the fact that her husband of 10 years was suddenly homosexual, had went off the deep end and starting popping pills like they were fucking pez. 

We were never a wealthy family, but the divorce and subsequent moving around resulted in even less money and the more we moved, the more shit that I lost, so I didn't have a lot of nice clothes, let alone comfort items.

I was disheveled. I was 10 years old and had barely been taught how to shower myself. I mean, even together my parents weren't the best and my home life was mediocre, but now it was amplified x 100.

No teachers really liked me. I was *that* student. I was going through a lot. I was inhumanely stressed and depressed for a 10 year old. I couldn't focus, the only thing I did well in school at that age was poetry. Because who doesn't write good poetry when they're clinically depressed? 

But most of all, I was bad at math. And when I say bad, I mean **really** fucking bad. 

I became painfully aware of how incredibly bad I was at it somewhere in the middle of the school year, and made the decision to start applying myself. I asked for a tutor, and received one. I started actually doing my homework, but would always get poor grades. I just wasn't grasping the material, I was so far behind due to my lack of participation up to that point.

But I kept going, and then one day it was time for a test. I studied for that test, oh man. I studied so hard. I took it, and I felt great about it. I thought I passed that shit easy, maybe even got an A!

So a couple days pass and my math teacher is handing the test back out, and as he's handing it out, I couldn't contain my excitement and pride, I spoke up: 

"I got at least a B, right!" I said with a big smile.

He stopped in his tracks, looked at me and laughed.

"You? A B?" He joked. "No, you got an F."

The entire class burst into laughter. I just stared at the desk for the rest of the class.

Life went on as normal after that, but I stopped trying in math and I suck at it to this day.

worst is she didn't teach shit. just sat there and distribute the notes to the class. and threw a book at my friend for talking in class. while she was just sitting there doing god knows what.

|-| cnx9t6s || 14 || I've posted this before, but still...

I had a LOT of bad teachers in school (both elementary and middle/high), but the #1 on my list was the P.E. teacher we had from 1st to 5th grade.

It wasn't enough that he had favorites and he graded us on whether he liked us or not, oh, no... in each grade he identified the worst student (based strictly on physical fitness) and treated him (it was always a boy) like crap and called him "Mariano" (his designated name for this "worse student"), outright refusing to use the kid's real name and even once berating and expelling from class one kid who demanded to be called by his name.

From best to worst in my class, I was #2, so I wasn't the target of this outright abuse... until our "Mariano" spent a month off sick. So I became the designated "Mariano" for that month.

You can imagine how much I hated this so-called "teacher"...

One day the teacher sent him to go grab some paperwork from the office which was at the other end of the building.  Chubby dude comes back out of breath and red faced.  Dick teacher teased him for being fat and made him do sit ups for the rest of class.  I remember keeping my head down for the rest of class so dick teacher couldn't see the tears in my eyes for poor chubby dude.  I sent chubby dude pictures of my boobs that night to cheer him up.  We graduated 12 years ago and I still keep in touch with him.  Such a nice guy, such a fucking asshole teacher.

I'll give you two less know who did an amazing job.

First, Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes. Yes, Benedict Cumberbatch did an amazing job but as a *modern* Sherlock. As a classic and victorian one, Jeremy Brett did an outstanding work. HE IS Sherlock Holmes with his stature, his manners, his gaze. Watch the Granada series, it is one of the best. Period.

Second is David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. Again, like Brett did with his character, Suchet IS Poirot. His costume, his manners, the way he talks, he walks, that's the way Agatha Christie described him in her book. I remember in an interview, Suchet was speaking about his character and his voice intonation started to change more and more. It was weird. Suddenly, there was no more Suchet. There was Poirot. Right during the interview, no costume, no make-up, and you can already recognize the famous belgian detective. Great actor. |-|

Don't be so obvious about who your favorites are. 

Don't make a rule that students can't use the word "can't", and get upset when a 3rd grader outsmarts you with coming up with different ways of conveying that meaning.

Also some from a somewhat unknown guy called Danny Schmidt:

- "There was every day that filled so full the weeks would float away, 
And there was all those days spent wondering what to do with all those days, 
There was every lie that ever saved the truth from being shamed, 
And every secret you could ever trust a friend to hide away, 
There was the fortune of discovering a new face you might adore, 
And the thrill of coming home to find her clothes upon the floor, 
And the prideful immortality of children in the home, 
That the storm can’t grind the mountain down, it can only shift the stones, 
And there was everything your mouth says that your lips don’t understand, 
And every shape inside your head you can’t carve with your hands, 
And every slice of glass revealed another slice of life, 
Emblazened imperfections in a perfect stream of light, 
It all flooded through the window like rapids made of fire, 
And then God rode through on sunshine and sat down cause he was tired, 
He was tired."

- "The story goes, or the way that I was told,
There was a king that always felt too high and then he fell too low, 
And so he called all the wise men to the hall, 
And begged them for a gift to end the rises and the falls, 

But here’s the thing, they came back with a ring, 
It was simple and was plainly unbefitting of a king, 
Engraved in black, it had no front or back, 
But there were words around the band that said, 
Just know: This Too Shall Pass" |-|

I figured it out pretty quick and got a C, while everyone else was getting destroyed.

What does he do?  He gets me signed up to retake algebra 1 as a freshmen, along with many other people.  So now I am  sophomore in geometry and I can't take chemistry this year, since (at my school) it is dependent on what level of math I am in.

So not only did it fuck up my math classes, but also my science classes.

tl,dr:  Teacher makes me retake algebra 1 as a freshmen, fucks up my high school career. |-| 
|-| cnxa9ca || 6 || Hi there, studying to be a teacher too :) Never thought I would do that in my life, now I can't wait to start! 

The worst teacher I ever had was my 6th grade teacher. Public school. I was already on a slippery path of losing interest for school and growing apart from my family and brother and she did the final push. 

I don't know how the others in the class felt about her, besides my friends who also hated her.

I was an ok student, lazy but would still get As and Bs. The school would have students both from the village around and the nearby trailer park. I started hanging out with the trailer park kids, who were having bad grades and being disruptive in class.

I was mostly quiet in class, once in a while would just burst out laughing from a note a friend would pass me, but would never talk or throw shit or be late. I preferred drawing. I would forget my book once in a while and she would always put me on the spot about it.

Anyways. To make a long story short, I lived right next to the school so on lunch hour I would sometimes go to my house to get some toys to play with my friends. Once my dad had bought me a pen that could also record like 3 seconds of audio and replay it fast or slow, super funny when you're a kid. 

She had seen me play with it during recess. After the lunch break I had left it in my locker, even forgot it in there after the class and went home without it.

That night, and the only time she did that, she called my parents *personally* to let them know that I had been playing with my pen all day in class and disturbing the whole class, ruining the day's lesson.

I will never understand why she did that. I still remember my dad yelling at me. It successfully alienated me from my parents for the rest of the year and up until the very last day of high school. They thought I was lying to their face when I said that I didn't even bring the pen in class, and that I was lying to them for the next 5-6 years straight.

The next day when I went to class she gave me a "How does that feel" look - I swear - and then sent me in the hallway for the rest of the week (3 days). I remember looking at the other kids' faces when I walked out the door, everyone was confused.

The janitor started talking to me a lot, showing me his home-made, faded blue tattoos (I now have about 20, *holy shit is that where it started???*). I thought he was pretty nice, nicer than the teacher.

From that point on, I began hating school and felt that no matter what I did I would always fail at it. I went from an A and B student to a C- and D student that year, and barely graduated high school. 

I only started having a normal relationship with my parents a few years after finishing high school and moving out.

My mom approached me a few years later and apologized for that night, about not believing me. My parents realized after going to parent-teacher meetings that she was fucked up, but didn't know how to make amends to a 11-year old kid.

Turned it, next day it was handed back with a big zero on it and a demand I redo the entire project.  Took it home to my folks and my mom was upset.  Went back to the school and the teacher was still there.  Mom demanded to know why it was rejected.  Teacher said it was because is was to good and made the other students projects look bad.  I had to redo it so that it was not as good.  I would also lose points for it being late.

My mother lost her mind that day.  I heard her say things I didn't know the meaning of.  It finally settled out that I got an A and did not redo the project.  The teacher hated me and tried to make the school year unbearable after that.  She was not a a teacher at that school the next year. |-|

Talked about how he blew up his ex-girlfriends engine and almost killed her, something something warrant out for my arrest in some state. While these are all predominantly personality flaws, he was 
also an awful educator. The highest grade in his class was a 68%. His method of instruction was to give you the wrong explanation and justify that by saying the best way to learn was to figure it out alone. One kid in my class tried to kill himself and explicitly mentioned Mr. douchebag in the note he left his mother. He wouldnt let any of the girls in the class answer questions, because "women cannot do science and studies have proven this". He weighed one really fucking skinny and obviously self conscious girl in front of the class and had her calculate the effect of gravity on herself in front of everyone. She was beet red. He made comments about the whole experience about how "some ladies get real embarrassed about their bodies."

The look on his face whenever he entered the room was clearly written with the expression of "Ugh... I'd rather die than have to deal with these retards, but I need the money.."

I had him for 3 semesters during High School (last semester of 1st grade, and both 2nd grade semesters - first semester of 1st grade is pretty much a introduction semester).

1st semester, 3 weeks in or so: This was when he started telling the class that about half of us were doomed, and should just drop out. He told us this SEVERAL times. He also called us idiots, useless, and he didn't ever really answer anything when you asked him. 

2nd semester, 1st day: (After that horrible 1st semester, we had called him out to the principal that he wasn't exactly being helpful, and was instead demotivating everyone). The VERY FIRST THING he said, after entering the class, was now that EVERY SINGLE ONE of us might aswell drop out, and that we'd NEVER get the job we would want. 2 weeks into 2. semester, he told a classmate of mine that "Since you don't seem to listen or care, you don't want to learn anything, so I'm going to fail you" (The person actually did listen, and all we needed to do those 2 weeks, was find a group to work with - which we had done the very first day). The actual assignments were easy, and no one really bothered to get help from him.

3rd semester - We had to start out exams project. On a scale of 1 to 10, from how helpful he is, it was a definite 1. Our group needed to google something, and also needed a specific electronics part. We didn't know the technical term for the thing we had to google, so we asked him, and his response was "Just google it", and we ended up getting help from another student who happend to know. The electronics part we needed wasn't found by that teacher either; A guy in our group had to ask his dad if he had one.. Same guy ended up having to ask his dad for how to make the plans for what we were building aswell, because our teacher didn't want to help, and he didn't want to help us look for it on the internet either (which we had spent like 7-8 hours total googling for).

|-| cnxbjbj || 194 || In Grade 9 in high school our biology teacher fell ill and was replaced early into the year. It's important to note that I am from Quebec and our Biology class was taught in French. 

This replacement was not temporary, it was to be for the whole year. I would have expected someone with a bit of experience and teaching abilities. I guess the school had a different idea. This replacement could barely speak English let alone French. She was a native Spanish speaker and it made classes nearly impossible to follow. Imagine trying to learn about cellular mitosis in three language mixed into one. It was impossible. 

She treated students like absolute shit and she picked on me specifically. I wasn't the best student, in terms of grades, but I always got my work done and submitted. The class was a nightmare. Kids in the back would light fires in their desks and plays cards while she tried to teach in what felt like a newly discovered language. I remember getting a detention for throwing a leaking glowstick at the front of the class. It leaked neon green coloured jizz all over the white projection screen. I didn't throw the glowstick but when she spun around she pointed right at me and sent me to the principal's office. The kid who threw the stick even confessed, but she didn't listen. 

During a test she accused me of cheating when I reached into my bag to grab my eraser. She grabbed my paper and wrote an F on it and sent me, once again, to the principal's office. I tried to protest, as did the other students, but there was no use. She was stubborn as fuck. 

My parents ended up intervening and there was a huge meeting with the principal, vice principal, teacher, and myself which led to her backing off of me because the principal threatened to terminate her. What a nightmare of a year that was.  |-|

* She once sent out everyone out of the class except 4 people, expecting that things would get better. People only got mad at her for her stupid reasons to send someone out of the class.
* She used to quit lessons early and just let everyone go because she couldn't handle us.
* Because of her accent from Belgium, she had a German accent that was just bad, nothing German
* She looked like on of the students
* She gave outrageous punishments for the smallest things and even called parents, almost all of the parents she called told her it was bullshit what she did.
* She made a Twitter especially for her students so we stopped trying to follow her on her real twitter. People making fun of her on twitter was the only result and sometimes she replied and tried to be funny, never worked.
* 80% of the lessons where videos where people explained things that she probably couldn't explained, sometimes she even ignored your question with the statement: ''You learn that next year''


She didn't actually had rights to give German, she didn't had any certificate and she was just hired only to get fired after 1 year, a friend of my found her after 2 years on the Dutch version of Ebay (marktplaats) wanting to give German lessons and she still didn't had a job yet. It was really clear she faked that she had studied in Belgium.

|-| cnxblif || 121 || I can never tell this story without sounding pompous, but I had a teacher that hated smart kids.  The class was "Communication Skills," required in 10th grade, all the kids from honors classes were together with kids from non-honors.  Usually this was no big deal.  But this particular teacher must have decided to teach us a lesson; all the honors kids got B's, all the non honors kids got A's. 

Completely arbitrarily, I should add.  It was a bullshit class, how to fill out a job application, how to give a presentation, how to make a speech.  5 of the top 20 students in the year (to that point, perfect 4.4 GPA's) all received their first B from that class.  The other 15 got A's in the session they took from another teacher.

And we were pissed off.  Nothing like a self-righteous, competitive 15 year old who's been screwed out of an A they believe they have earned.  So we all took summer school, aced the makeup class, preserved our perfect 4.4's.  That asshole wasn't going to stop us.  That was one amazingly competitive graduating class, I tell you what. |-| 
|-| cnxblmv || 25 || Did you exchange a walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage |-| 
|-| cnxbltg || 775 || I've posted this before, but was late to the party and didn't really get seen:

I took speech as an elective my senior year. The woman who taught it was a former student of the same high school.

Day 1: I walk in, roll is called, and teacher asks "Furiosnymph, are you related to Brothernymph?" I reply yes, and she just kinda laughs and says "I went to school with him. I certainly hope you aren't a screwup like he was."

Now, I adore my oldest brother. We're extremely close, and when she said this, he was actually in fucking Iraq and I was scared to death that I'd get notified he'd been killed every day. So I immediately hated her, but couldn't say anything, because I was "just a kid" and it would be disrespectful.

So, throughout the year, she's constantly telling the class stories about what a fuck-up my brother was. Some were true, some were completely made up. One night, I find out that my brother has been hit by a roadside bomb, and two of his squad members are dead. This was early on in the war, where you didn't really get a confirmation on what had happened, just that there had been an "incident." I stayed up until nearly 5 that morning to learn my brother had lived through the incident, and was so relieved I cried what few tears I had left.

The next day, I fall asleep in speech class, teacher freaks out and starts ranting about how I'm just like my brother, etc, etc.

I finally flip my shit, and I'm like "YES! I am just like my brother! He's honorable, and he's not a fucking asshole like you! I'm fucking done, you can fucking fail me for this class, I've already been accepted into college AND HAVE A GODDAMN SCHOLARSHIP! SO JUST FUCK OFF YOU FUCKING BITCH!"

And I left her class and walked out of the school. Got suspended the next day for skipping class, and I told the principal I wasn't going back to speech class, so I might as well get suspended the rest of the year. I spent the remaining few months as an office assistant during that period.

Later on, after my brother returned from Iraq, I was telling him all about this bitch teacher. He said, "Oh yeah, I know her. She was kind of a slut. I slept with her once. She started calling constantly and telling me she loved me and threatening my girlfriend so I had to threaten to go to the police to get her to leave me alone."

She talked down to me, told me I wasn't smart, that I wasn't good enough for her GT class, that I had ADD (this was back in the 80s when it wasn't diagnosed every 5 seconds) and my mother needed to medicate me, and told me she'd guarantee that I'd never be in the GT program again. 

She succeeded for two years and I was put back in for 6th grade, which was the last year that they kept the GT kids "together" for almost all of their classes. 

I never had ADD. If I recall correctly, I made As and Bs in her class. We did come to an agreement that I'd raise my fist into the air and she'd let me go outside and run around to "burn off my extra energy". I abused the shit out of that.

She picked out of date readings for us to use and present to the class, only to interrupt us and tell us what the new findings are and  laugh while doing it. 

During my presentation, which involved some math, she interrupted me to tell me that my numbers were wrong. I polled a few students that had also done my worksheet, and they agreed with my numbers. She told me to erase the answers I had on the board, as they were wrong. I decided to do the equation on the board, and it turned out that she was off by a factor of 10^2. Her number was right, she just didn't cancel her exponents. She later lambasted me for disrespecting her, and claimed that if she were a male professor I would not have challenged her in front of the class.

She also made the autistic and deathly-afraid-of-public-speaking student in the class cry during his presentation, and essentially failed him on the project for leaving to go cry in private. Worst part: she had required us to send her our slides a week before the presentation, so she could check them. Then she points out from her notes errors he made publicly.

It was known that at the cafeteria, every teacher gave their wine left over to this guy because they knew he'd finish it.

He basically didn't teach anything and just made us do exercises while looking over our backs.

One time he went through all the students like this and looked at their work and just said "false" followed by a smack to the head. For every single student. I got it right, so he said "that's right" and smacked me anyway.

Seeing I was better at math than most others, I was kind of his favorite. So one time he strangled me with those big yellow board rulers because I couldn't answer his questions.

He also gave the worst grades of any teacher I knew and would often give an extra point or two to everybody after council told him that apparently everybody failing his class is not something that should happen.

I kind of liked him. |-|

|-| cnxbt8c || 206 || She was one of the two sixth grade teachers I had (each group of sixth grade students were taught by two teachers.  Each group was focused on some different topic, mine was "Communications Technology").  She had a TON of ridiculous rules that were really out to get you.  This school had a system where they would issue demerits for misdeeds, three demerits added up to a detention.  At the end of each semester they would throw a party for all of the students who did not get a demerit; no one attended the final party.

Here are some of the rules.  Each student must have three sharpened pencils.  If you came to class with two pencils you received a demerit.  Students must have their planners with them at all times.  If they do not have their planner they get a demerit.  If anyone talked, they got a demerit; no warnings were issued for this sort of thing.  It felt like we were in a crazy internment camp.

The school started doing this crazy test taking strategy that they enforced very harshly.  I remember it feeling like the most ridiculous thing.  It was called PIRATES, which was an acronym, though I can't remember what all of the letters stood for, I just remembered it made the tests take a lot longer.  You had to start by writing your name and an inspirational statement to yourself on the top of your test.  Something like, "I studied and I am ready to take this test."  While taking the test you had to do a ton of work with symbols.  For example, question marks went next to questions you were unsure of, a smiley face or something went next to questions you knew you got right, you HAD to cross out all answers that you knew were incorrect, and several others.  I suppose giving this information to us was a decent idea that could have helped people, but all it ever did was make people lose points for messing up part of the strategy.  One time a girl got 100% on the test but was marked down because she failed to put a question mark next to questions she didn't know the answer to.... but she knew all of the answers.

I slid by mostly unnoticed but this one kid, we'll call him Charlie, was constantly in trouble.  He was a bit of a weird kid but he wasn't really too bad, just struggled to keep on top of things.  He was always missing pencils and stuff so the teachers started making him keep his pencils in a special cup on their desk.  This wouldn't have been a problem if he didn't get in trouble for having fewer than three pencils to begin with.  On top of that, his locker was always disorganized which really annoyed them, so they brought in a cardboard box, put it in the corner of the room, wrote his name on it, and made him use that for a locker.  It must have been humiliating.  He was constantly scolded and was just slammed with demerits.  He must have had a detention every week and he got suspended a few times for the dumbest shit, like not having three pencils.

The worst part about it is how she always said that students would come back after they graduated and thank her for being strict because it taught them about discipline which prepared them for life.  I just wanted to go back and tell her how much everyone hated her.

Edit:  Some people have been telling me to go back and tell her how much I hated her but I don't think I can do that.  I have been considering sending her an email and even found a way to contact her on the school's website.  I also found her first name and was able to look her up on facebook.  After stalking her facebook profile for a little while I have decided that I can't say what I want to say without being mean or harsh in some way.  I have been removed from the situation for so long I am sure that my memories no longer provide an accurate portrayal of what it is really like to be her student.  She has a husband and a family and I really can't feel good about attacking her.  I spent one year as her student and made it out all but unaffected.  I can't imagine what kind of emotional damage I might be able to cause her with a strongly worded email.  For that reason, I have decided to leave it as it is. |-|

One thing she refused to do was grade homework and tests. So instead of working on the next lesson, she had us swap papers with our neighbors and mark down wrong answers as she yelled out the correct ones.

Afterward, she wouldn't even collect the papers. Instead, she called everyone's names and we had to shout out our scores for her to record. This is how everything was graded. Yes, there was a lot of cheating going on.

You're a bad kid that's not going anywhere. I know that you cheated. There is no way someone as dumb and lazy as you could have done well on this." 


He once made me stand up in front of the class and asked "Who here is friends with roastbeastsanguiches?" Out of the 35 there only 2 raised there hands. He just smirked, said "I thought so." and told me to sit down.

I don't think people should constantly put their kids in front of screens.   
 Your iPad is not a damn babysitter and it's absolutely terrible for your children's eyes and fine motor skills!  Get them some hands-on toys and let them use their imagination.  Also, your phone is your phone!   If your child can't behave in a waiting room or at a restaurant without demanding you fork over your phone so they can watch Dora, you have created a monster.  Fix it now before it escalates into something much bigger.

I came in to say goodbye to, everyone was pretty cool about it, then I got to my English teacher, she starts asking me "what's wrong with your mother", I tell her that it's private, I'd rather not speak about it and said my goodbyes. No hassle, didn't think anything of it. 

I returned a year later, my mum survived despite being on the very edge, last rites read etc. and throughout the year, my English teacher was a complete bitch to me, at first I just blew it off but then everyone started asking my why she hates me so much. One day I came into class from lunch with a can of coke, took my bag off and she starts on me again, telling me to put the can in the bin so I knock the rest back walking to the bin "DID I TELL YOU TO FINISH IT FIRST, STAND OUTSIDE NOW!". Jeez.

She comes out, ripping me a new asshole, telling me I look like a mess and that I need to get my act together. There was nothing wrong with the way I looked, it was well known that I was the top of my school in everything so I just snapped "What the fuck is your problem with me?

|-| cnxegpe || 5 || I always had trouble with Science in Junior High School (grades 7-9, give or take 15~ years back). So after asking the teacher a couple times if I was lost, i'd ask classmates for help and it was often misinterpreted as socializing, which would get me sent down to *The Den*. The Den was a play on words, as our school's mascot was a grizzly bear yet essentially it was a detention center. A small room with 8 desk computers, four on each side. You'd remain here for the duration of your class, then move onto the next. I wasn't a very rebellious teen so I sat and struggled through my work the best I could.

Eventually, I stopped asking for help in class to prevent being sent away and would sit there desperately trying to figure things out on my own, but would result in many blank pages or unanswered questions. So of course, this was taken as "not paying attention" and off to the Den I went again. My family moved from our little farm home a year prior across the country to a substantially bigger city, Calgary Alberta, so young me didn't want to disappoint my parents that I was doing bad in my new school and it never really dawned on me at the time how I was not the one in the wrong, so i kept quiet about it to them and the head office. Eventually I would step into the class, and before sitting down I would be sent back to the Den to work there, completely separating me from my classmates. To no surprise, I failed the class and had to take extra studies during the summer in order to not fail the grade, and the teacher was gone the following year.

Not because he was fired-- because he moved up in his position. I learned several years later that prior to being a terrible teacher, [Mr. Frank Bruseker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Bruseker) was a provincial level politician. Was voted out and went into teaching for a couple years, then moved back into politics. 

Thank you Mr.Bruseker for making the pick for *The Worst Teacher* so incredibly easy for me. Please stay out of schools and never interact with another student again, you pile of shit. |-|

She bullied me for taking so many days off school (I was very ill that year and in an out of hospitals) and repetitively called me a liar and a fake, making demeaning comments to me in front of other students. Apart from me, there was one girl who had it the worst. She clearly had problems at home and this teacher exploited that. She would constantly make offhand comments directed towards her because mother worked at McDonalds, saying things like "you better work hard or you will end up working at McDonalds" while staring at the girl in the eye. She was absolutely horrible and I'm shocked that she kept that job as long as she did. I really wish I was exaggerating but this woman really was a demon of a woman.

|-| cnxftzj || 47 || Her name was Mrs. Krasner. This is already a bad sign.

This was 4th grade. 

Mrs. Krasner had been hit in a car accident a few years prior and was rendered temporarily paralyzed and needed to learn to walk again.

Whether she was emotionally traumatized or just spiteful, Mrs. Krasner was a shitty teacher. 

She hated boys. We always attributed it to her being hit by a man in the accident or that she was mysteriously without a husband but boys could do nothing in her class. My friends and I were given detention for unnecessary eye contact. We were given detention and a call home because on the first day of class the boys sat together in a group. All 6 of us. The girls, however were free to talk as they pleased provided they whispered. 

Mrs. Krasner also disagreed with teaching math or science. We did not learn the curriculum for 4th grade math. We also ignored all of basic science. She did this because Mrs. Krasner felt that Shakespeare was better for our age group. So instead of geometry, we listened to a midsummer nights dream, unabridged, read aloud to us multiple times until Mrs. Krasner felt we understood it. 

Mrs. Krasner did not like noise either. The sexism plays in here. 

Anything that was deemed unnecessary noise pollution was stopped immediately and with prejudice, save the girls whispering. If the boys wore pants made of synthetic fiber or made a "swishing" noise, he was sent home to change. If anything dropped from a desk, she confiscated it indefinitely. The window units or fans were never run because they rattled. If a dog barked outside, she would scream and call the office demanding it be fixed. If the landscapers were working, she would scream and call the office. If traffic was too loud, she would scream and call the office. The boys had daily lessons on etiquette in the hallways. We did not have recess because it was too noisy for her to be outside.

We watched one movie in that class. We watched it because Mrs. Krasner had smeared her makeup and was frustrated. 

It was a 3 hour long documentary on the Statue of Liberty. Guess how many boys got detention for fidgeting. All of us. 

She apparently died recently. Thank god. |-|

I hate cities and currently only live in one because I'm forced to (job--hope maybe I can someday hit it big and commute from a rural area at least).  I'd rather step outside and just see miles of corn fields or snow.

I'm fairly conservative, socially and economically.  Although I have mixed feelings about drug laws and acknowledge human-caused climate change.

I don't think people should get divorced, especially if they have children, unless there's abuse going on.  My parents divorced when I was young and it devastated my mom, brother, and me financially.  I had to move away from all my friends and suffer bullying for being poor.  My brother still has attachment issues from it.  We also moved to a city after that, where I dealt with a much crueler batch of classmates.  Even when I was poor in a rural area I wasn't made fun of for it.  Kids are cruel anywhere, sure, but in my experience they're much worse in cities.

I prefer winter over summer/spring.  I like how it keeps most people inside and makes everything quiet.  It's a lot easier to heat an area than it is to cool it.  In winter, if you get cold, go inside to be comfortable.  In summer, especially if you live in a humid climate and don't have air conditioning, you have to sweat inside, too.  You can put more layers on, but you can only take so many off, and even naked it can still feel hot.

I'm not going to bother arguing about any of these here, so feel free to just hit the disagree arrow and move on.  I'll gladly clarify anything, however.

|-| cnxh8jz || 11 || Ms. Spahn. Sounds like spawn. Like spawn of the devil. 

She had fiery red hair, and had been teaching math at my local middle school for far too many years. The years had clearly taken a toll on her. I'm the youngest of 3, so my older siblings had forewarned me of Ms. Spahn when I entered middle school. I knew to avoid her class at all costs. 

Day 1 of middle school and I get my schedule in homeroom. Sure enough, my first class is with Ms. Spahn. I was in the most advanced math class for my grade, and she was the only one who taught it. She started off the class by saying, "If you think you're going to fall behind, leave now. I have no use for stragglers. We move like this **snaps fingers** in this class." No introduction, she went straight to work and handed out assignments. 

That day, I went to my guidance counselor during lunch and requested to be put in a lower math class, because I feared the one I was in was too far advanced. They gave me a new schedule after switching it around, and now I was in the lowest math class, well below my skill set. I didn't mind being the smartest kid in the class so long as I wasn't in Ms. Spahn's class. 

Sure enough, I get to 4th period math and I am right back in Ms. Spahn's class. Turns out she taught all levels of math. I tried to get switched out again, but now had no good reason other than "I think my teacher is the spawn of Satan." I spent the next 3 years with her as my math teacher and because of her, I fucking hate math. I was so good at it before her, top of my class, and now, I fucking hate math. Thanks, Ms. Spahn. 

While she was the worst teacher I ever had, I did have some slight respect for her when she broke apart a fight before class one day. Two girls were fighting in the hallway, hair was ripped out, an earring was ripped out, and there was a lot of commotion outside of our classroom. Ms. Spahn didn't even hesitate to step in between these barbaric pre-teen girls and pull them apart. She could have lost her job for that. Security arrived and took the girls away, Spahn dusted off her frumpy math teacher dress, and proceeded to teach class like nothing happened. That was pretty bad ass.  |-|

|-| cnxhj6c || 4 || Nothing that bad happened to me personally, but one thing I saw happen between one teacher and another student during a PE/Gym class was terrifying. There was this one girl, I'm not aware of what her condition was exactly, but it did leave her with a very noticeable physical disability. To give a brief description, her arms and legs had very little capability to bend, plus her hands/fingers suffered the same. Now in our Sports Hall we had one of those large indoor climbing walls, they'd teach the students how to set up harnesses and spot for other students. 

So there were a ton of people doing all different kinds of sports until we heard the all-too-often-heard 'shouting voice' of the Teacher and some intense sobbing. Easily 2-3 classes all turned at once to see that the teacher had actually forced a climbing harness onto her and was screaming in her face for her to start climbing. Now our school would always get pissy when people refused to do sport, but this had every single student, bad and good watching with open mouths.

It was a good couple of years back now, but seeing how upset she was and that she was trying her hardest to explain that she clearly wasn't physically capable was scary as shit. Eventually, when he picked up that he was being watched by everyone, he took the harness off of her and things continued (awkwardly) as normal. It was fair to see, me and a good thirty other students immediately went to the Senior Staff and reported everything that happened. And to shed a bit of light on why he was such a bad teacher, there were many more instances of his anger problem surfacing and going apeshit on a variety of students almost every week.  |-|

A complete and absolute numbness that frequently made me think, *I just wish I could feel something*, but I didn't realize this wasn't normal. I just thought it was a sign that my life had become boring, or balanced. I was wrong.

So though I am sad, angry and bitter, and though my quality of life has taken a bit of a downgrade since I left you, I am better off for not having to deal with your emotional abuse and manipulation. 

After everything we went through, I hardly thought I would be able to stop loving you, let alone actually grow to hate you. But there it is.

Edit: Yes, my ex is on Reddit. No, it's not you. If it is you, you know it's you. If you're not sure if it's you, it's not you. |-|

They are not part of the relationship that we failed to maintain, and they deserve to have both parents in their lives. I pray to god that you realize these things by the time they are aware of their surroundings. Cause all you're doing is stopping them from leading a normal life.  |-|

I fucking needed you, you told me you would be there and love me, and you used me and literally justified it with "because you let me." I should have wised up years before I did but without any family and then no home and all the trauma I wasn't all there, but I was a perfect target. Oh, and your best friend did sexually abuse me no matter what you fucked up assholes say happened. I hope no one ever mistakes you for a good person to date, for their sake. I loved you with every fiber of my being and I wasn't perfect but at least I didn't fucking use and abuse someone in need. Please stay alone forever.

|-| cnxjjo3 || 79 || you are such a narcissist. you have to put down everyone around you to make yourself feel better, even when you know that your put downs are total lies. you took my v-card and then told me that i'd never find a better sexual partner (totally false). so long as i was with you, i assumed that was bragging on our sex life, but as soon as we broke up i realized it was supposed to keep me from developing interest in other girls. you were so controlling and your suspicion over my ex THAT I NEVER EVEN TALKED TO is what finally killed our relationship (other than you sleeping with my roommate/best friend). 

you constantly professed your hatred for drama and the people that create it when you were a bigger source of drama and ill feelings in our friend group than all the rest of us combined. you used one friend after another as a scape goat for all the things that went wrong in your life. you would blame them for anything you could while talking them down in front of others until you finally tried to kick them out of the group. if anyone questioned the validity of your opinion, you would back it up saying another friend shared that opinion. you never realized that i made a habit of checking with those friends to see that they never shared your opinion at all. you lied to and used the people who cared for you as tools to make yourself look better to others.

as everything was falling apart with us, you even tried to make my friends lose respect for me. you took my best friend and pitted us against each other. you told him so much shit about me that wasn't true or was twisted to make me look like the bad guy that he gave in when you tried to seduce him because you'd made him think I didn't deserve a bitch like you. then when i found out you cheated with him, you made me think it was him coming after you and made the enmity between us far worse than it had to be. 

it's my own damn fault for believing your half-truths for so long and only seeing through them after the fact, but i want you to know that i see right through you now. you were so worried after we broke up that i would tell our friends how you cheated, that you lied to their faces to try to cover your tracks and discredit me. thankfully, our friends are pretty smart. i didn't turn them against you. you did.

I really do hope you are happy with him and you get married just like you planned, and i apologize for the petty things i did after the break up too. i'm especially sorry to my former best friend. maybe if i had realized sooner that she was pitting us against each other, we could have salvaged some of our friendship (or at least our pride), but i was too caught up in my jealousy. 

I think the biggest thing you taught me was to value my friends even more than i already did. i hope you eventually learn to value your friends at all. |-|

Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me  
Battle-scarred shogun, explosion when my pen hits

Shacklin the masses with drastic rap tactics  
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths  
Black Wu jackets queen B's ease the guns in  
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function  
Heads by the score take flight incite a war  
Chicks hit the floor, diehard fans demand more  
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly

Mine was one of the longer messages, and it scared me about how close to reality it hit, even though my ex never used reddit, and I'm sure she hasn't changed.

There's a very low chance it was written by her, but it still hits way close to home, reading an ambiguous message from a stranger to their ex. At least I know I'm not alone with these fears and anxieties. 

I'll end my way too long post with a message for my ex. 
I always had a subconscious thought this was how it was going to end. It wasn't too early, and it wasn't too late. We finished because it was best for us, at least that's what I thought.

|-| cnxktfc || 3 || Abbey Road!! |-| 
|-| cnxkuri || 3036 || Why? 

I still don't get it.  You always told me how scared you were that I would leave you because you couldn't imagine life without me. I've dated so many men and women and was engaged before you, but I've never had chemistry as instant, amazing, and long-lasting as I had with you; we both agreed it didn't fade at all over the length of the relationship.  It was/is still there, even when you decided you couldn't have me any more.  One month you write me a love letter saying that I've given you a purpose in life and that you want the fairytale ending with me, and the next month out of the blue you say you still love me but that I'm not enough anymore and that you want to move somewhere else to find a better job, and you can't interrupt my dreams to do that. I know you're scared of the future right now, I know how desperately worried you are that you won't accomplish something big in your lifetime.  I had thought that our love could be that something big for you, but I realize your heart craves something bigger. You're going to be a man among the stars, even if you have to charm a million people to get there, my Prince Charming. You taught me how to be extroverted and how to see that every person has a story worth listening to. Thank you for that.  

&amp;nbsp;

But the thoughts keep swirling swirling swirling in my head, no matter how hard my brain tells me that this was the right thing to happen. What did I ever do that stopped being good enough for you?  Why don't you miss me? What changed? Why didn't you want to wait until after Christmas? Why did you show up in my bedroom at 1:00am the day after leaving me, crying, apologizing for making a horrible mistake, only to leave me all over again in the morning? I would've traveled to hell and back just to make you smile after a bad day at work.  I never in a million years saw this coming.  I hope you know and never forget how completely I love you. I appreciate your every quality and flaw. I hope you read the goodbye letter I wrote you.  I hope if, days or months or years from now, it's 3am and you can't sleep because life is too dark, I hope you call me.

&amp;nbsp;

In the words of our song, "You'll never know dear, how much I love you, please don't take my sunshine away." (How goddamn ironic, right? That song has awful lyrics!) I will always look back on our time fondly, and I hope that you do too.  I hate that you were able to do this to me, but I don't regret a single second that our lives were intertwined.

&amp;nbsp;

 I can't forget seeing you, my strong smart beautiful man, crying and huddled on my floor saying, "I'm scared I'm going to regret leaving you for the rest of my life." I'm terrified of that too. The mental image haunts me. I know you want to explore the world and find your happiness, but I wish you'd wanted to take me with you instead of feeling you needed to leave me behind.  

&amp;nbsp;

I would've supported you through anything. Hell, I even support you through breaking up with me; I know and saw how difficult it was for you. In a perverse way, I'm almost proud of you for leaving me. (Almost.) You'd resigned yourself to a mediocre job, and in our time together you got even more confident and willing to think outside the box to pursue your own happiness.  You're stronger than me; I'd never have been able to leave you. And if you had to leave me to find yourself, thank you for doing it now rather than after we were married with kids. Please, I beg you, please find your happiness and make this decision worth it.  Don't break anybody else along your journey if you can help it. (You can help it. You're a good man.)

&amp;nbsp;

My entire life, I've been strong, confident, optimistic, and had my life planned out. I've never been even remotely mentally ill before. None of my other relationships affected me like this. Calling off my wedding in college didn't have nearly as much of an effect on me as realizing that you're no longer interested in talking to me. Suddenly I am none of those things and I want none of those things. You showed me the beauty of the smallest things of life, and also spurred on a full-fledged identity crisis and existential crisis. I guess this is what they call situational depression. I had no idea it was possible for "sad" to hurt so physically, so completely, and so overwhelmingly to the point where it's difficult to breathe. Don't worry about me, sweetheart, I got some xanax.

&amp;nbsp;

Honestly, though, I forgive you for everything. I know you so well and I know how unfulfilled you feel.  I hope you find what you're looking for in life, even if it isn't me.  I'm so happy that you don't know I cry 10x a day now, because it would hurt you to know how much I'm hurting, and I don't want you to hurt. I hope you think I'm happy, because that will make your life so much easier than knowing I'm hope I don't wake up anymore.  I'm flying to your hometown tomorrow -- a city that I hate, but where we were supposed to be moving together -- to look at the job that I applied for when we were together.  

&amp;nbsp;

I'm not vain or irrational enough to think my story is unique, or that my breakup is worse than any other, or that my love was more true or perfect or special than the billions of other romances through history, but fuck, it sure felt like it. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm pretty sure I'm too stubborn to kill myself, but if the plane crashes, I hope you find your glasses in my dresser; I kept them safe for you.  I never want my apartment key back from you.
&amp;nbsp;
---------------
Edit to add: I miss you with every molecule of my body. But even more than that, I miss who I was when I was with you.  I miss the me before you shattered my remaining naivete about how the world works.  I'm going to keep trying to remember how to care about anything, but I can't trust people, I can't trust my own judgment, I can't trust my own thoughts (mere chemical reactions? a soul?). Life is such a fleeting, fickle, meaningless thing and yet I wanted to spend it with you. I would give anything just to know what you're thinking right now. We used to joke that I could read your mind.  I want to buy you a souvenir from my trip, but I guess I won't.  I sleep with a nightlight now.  I trust that you won't tell anybody.  |-| 
|-| cnxkv4s || 9 || I'm sorry for how everything ended up. You asked me to give you space, and you asked for some time to think. I couldn't handle being alone. I felt rejected, lost, and frustrated over how hard I worked on everything. I regret deeply how much I hurt you; trying to continue perusing after. I was in the middle of a depressive time. I hid it from you. That does not excuse me disregarding your boundaries. I showed a lack of respect, and a child-like need to get my way. This is not the man I was raised to be, and I feel shame over the whole situation.
I wish we could rebuild as friends, but I know you've already moved on. I still care deeply for you. I want to see you successful and happy in your life. I hope you find something you can be passionate about. |-|

As he was handing out the exams, he says "K4td0ug is proof that you don't have to be good at sports to understand them". 

Teach 2: First year uni english prof. Our first assignment was to write about whether universities promote individuality or conformity. I figured everyone else would write about uni promoting individuality so I decided it would be more interesting to write about conformity. When I walked into the next class, my introductory paragraph had been made into a transparency and was projected onto the wall. The prof snarled "Whoever wrote this doesn't deserve to be here.

Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life) is a very heartfelt and genuine goodbye song, and I don't find it whiny at all.

And American Idiot... holy fuck, American Idiot. I could go on for hours and hours about what a damn work of art American Idiot is. It came out at the right time in American history to really make a political and social impact, the story it tells is an exciting, emotional journey, the songs themselves are some of the best of the 2000's, it's just a masterpiece through and through.

They're also incredible live. If you want an amazing concert film, check out Bullet In A Bible or Awesome As Fuck.

I will defend Green Day on Reddit until the day I die.

Our class lost a combined value of over $3million in scholarships. Next year many of us went to the community college.

People would get stickers for getting As on tests or for doing all of their homework for the whole month.  I would get stickers for handing our papers.  I was the only student who got stickers for simple easy things.  She probably thought she was cutting me slack, but it just made me feel like an idiot, and the rest of the kids started treating me like one. She would actively belittle me during class and laugh at my questions like I was precious. When I called her out on it, she called my parents in to speak to them, because of my bad attitude.  Told them to stop speaking to me in Spanish because I was too slow to learn both languages.  They both have a very thick Spanish accent, she would speak very slowly as if they were idiots.  My dad was a professor at an Ivy League school.

She got a job offer at the gifted program which she took and we got a different teacher.  Ironically named Mrs. Rice.  Mrs. Rice was awesome and immediately started helping me with homework and tests and such.  Turns out I had ADHD.  She helped me concentrate and raised my grades by at least 2 letter grades, where I was getting Ds and Cs I started getting Bs and As. 

Unbeknownst to me she recommended me for the gifted program.  The next year I ran into Ms. Wright at the gifted program.  She froze in her tracks and got all red in the face with a look like she had seen a ghost.  She said "What are you doing here?" as if she was insulted.  I wish I had been smarter and had made some fancy comeback, but I just said, "They told me I had to."

Still her reaction warms my feels to this day.


TL;DR teacher treated me like I was an idiot and then I ran into her in the gifted program the next year and I couldn't think of a sweet zinger. |-|

|-| cnxm3v4 || 3 || My sophomore-year world history "teacher" was arguably not. He often stopped teaching to talk to the athletes in the class, one time he tried to have a student teach a lesson because he felt the member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes was more suited to teaching a segment that touched on Biblical history than he did (Probably true).       

Plus, he went out of his way to pick on not-athletes. He mispronounced my last name on the first day. No big deal, it happens often enough, so I corrected him on it. From that day on, he referred to me only by my last name, mispronounced. I was the only student in a class of probably close to 20 that he referred to by last name. And there wasn't any reason for it, there were no other girls in the class with my first name. It got to the point where some of my classmates were doing it too. I had to confront him and tell him I didn't like what he was doing before he'd stop.    

I heard he was fired for inappropriate behavior towards other female students. Good riddance.  |-|

|-| cnxm4pi || 3 || High school teacher. 9th grade. First three days of class she doesn't show up (cool I guess, we got a nice lady for the sub).

She would come late every other day (15-20 min), sloooowly dragging her ass through the hall, which is something we didn't mind as high school kids

She would always come in a mini skirt, which was disgusting considering she was pretty fat.

It was a health class and she wouldn't really teach us anything. She would give us an assignment from the book and spend the class talking on her phone.

Most people, myself included, gave up on the class couple weeks in. I had a friend, who really wanted to go to high end university after highschool and busted his ass off... he finished the class with a C because she lost most of his work. Complaint to administrator resulted in him being told "you need to make copies of all the work you turn in"

Other teachers hated her because she'd borrow stuff (projectos, dvds, etc) and never return it (presumably got lost)

There was a rumor circulating around the school for many years that she used to be a stripper and would shave her legs in class... thank God I never had to see that

She was racist. Black kids would get an A, Mexicans would get C, and if you're white the best thing you could do is fail and retake the class with a different teacher

She could not get fired because she was black and part of a union

After my junior year, a lot of teachers got cut because of budget shortages. Many of the new, ambitions teachers, everyone loved, were let go... and guess what bitch didn't get fired.

|-| cnxm5rg || 4 || **“Whenever something is wrong, something is too big.”**

I believe nation states and territories need to be smaller. They almost exclusively derive their power from their population size and its economic translation. This is the single biggest issue affecting Europe in the euro zone crisis today and in past wars. 

As their populations and economies expand, they become more dangerous in militaristic terms and in economic terms as business interests will always be entangled. A stronger centralised state has only a greater chance to be appropriated for private interest.  

I've reached the conclusion that 20 million is the cut off for a dangerous sized population. Briefly, succinctly, I reached that conclusion observing the big 5 of Europe plus Poland vs the rest. Beyond that point we should be seeking to create a new autonomous governing body to keep things fair and balanced. And then keep that process of redrawing the administrative boundaries as the population increases. 

The union of broadly equal sized states in america goes the furthest to solve the problem of imbalance (one of the things that makes them cohesive allowing them to dominate) but the issue is creeping up on them in California and Texas, then Illinois, Florida and New York. 

But existing governments obviously fight what undermines their consolidation of power and most people still don't see size as an issue despite the phrase 'too big to fail, too big to care' entering popular dialogue. According to most it only applies to banks and corporations and even then they demand no action. The states is a corporation. 

As simple as it can be boiled down to, the problems on all continents is the size of nations (in conjunction with diversity but size renders minorities invisible, lowers transparency, representativeness and increases power/wealth of fewer groups of people linked to the state-corporate node)

It's the rudimentary geographic principle of core and periphery. The blue banana in Europe and the coasts in the States. In the middle east too we underestimate the impact of our liberal ideas because we concentrate on cities and are then surprised when the rural conservatives gain the whole nation as their domain. 

In an ideal world, I'd like to see borders capturing zones ~20m. This means larger rural sites and getting smaller as settlements get more dense particularly in anonymous Guangdong. No one state could be overly powerful. 

I've said nothing about scales of governance up to this point and unions are fine. The US works to a point and the EU could too but not likely. They must have the right structure of local - regional - strategic - national - international admin in place, each one checking the powers of the next. But give any territories many more people than the rest, their economy becomes a significant share. They disrupt the union. They start to be able to stand on their own (and jostling for lebensraum). Or you make it so that the whole union can only be as strong as one part. We limit ourselves and they hold us to ransom. 

It's all about structure. Most of our political problems stem from a poor appreciation of structure. men may be inherently greedy but that's not what let the USSR communist mission fail. It was a single totalitarian monolithic leviathan. We've wanted too eagerly to skip to the end of the game where borders are clean, states are as few as possible and humanity is one. It's clean. It's simple. That has only done us damage. It comes from the notion that there should be a God, a single unifying benevolent One. He's not here yet and we can't recreate it. 

We think "Why do we need borders? If we didn't have borders the world would be one and there could be peace one Earth.". That's a one world government. Totalitarian. No, we need more borders; as many lines as you can draw without it being a giant dot. Human scale. Pure market competition translated into politics. Sure collusion would still be possible but if there's one thing we know about geopolitics it's that we don't like surrendering autonomy once we've had a taste of it and under these circumstances no one would have overwhelming power to seize it by threat or economic domination. 

Broadly, unity and centralisation are principles of monarchy and the Right. The Left doesn't destroy itself when it splinters. Decentralisation, resistance and fragmentation are inherent to the ideal. 'Workers of the world unite' is a false philosophy and batting for the other side. We only need share one idea in common. Disunity is the way to freedom and peace.

|-| cnxm7kx || 8 || I had a teacher in 6th grade that just decided very early on that she didn't like me. I was always very good in school and was also kind of the class clown, and I can only assume she saw that combination as suspicious. She would constantly give me bad grades and my parents were absolutely baffled. She was my math/sciences teacher and my dad, a doctor of physics and radiology, decided he would do my math assignment she gave me to see what grade she would give HIM. Got the assignment back with a 0. Not a barely-passable grade, a 0. She claimed I never turned the assignment in, so my parents immediately set up a parent-teacher conference. While in the parent-teacher conference, my parents said my teacher immediately went on the offensive talking about how I did nothing but joke around and slack off and distract other students. My dad brought up the recent assignment asking how the son of a physicist could get a 0 on a math assignment after getting high As in previous years. She rambled about some students not being prepared for 6th grade (Ha!) and how it was kind of a separating point in student's intelligence at this age. My dad reaches down in to the trash can next to her desk and pulls out the UNGRADED ASSIGNMENT THAT HE FILLED OUT TO BAIT HER. When he asked her what it was, she claimed she'd never seen it and still insisted I never turned it in. He revealed to her what he had done and she threatened to have me punished for plagiarism. My parents stormed out of the meeting and went immediately to the principal's office. With 3 months left in the school year she was fired and we had an AWESOME sub for the rest of the year. My grandfather and great-grandfather passed away a month later and the sub gave me 100s on all the assignments I missed while I was gone for 2 weeks in another state for each of their funerals.

Even typing this out now, it still strikes me as completely absurd the lengths she went to in order to punish me for... what? I was never disruptive, just liked to have fun. |-|

|-| cnxm8mo || 14 || I briefly went to primary school in Glasgow. In primary 2 we had the worst teacher I have ever come across. She was a terrifying cunt of a human being.

At age 6, if you asked to go to the bathroom she would scream at you until she was hoarse for interrupting her and not waiting until break time. I was a really quiet kid and very nervous, and was terrified of getting in trouble. So I was too scared to ask to go to the bathroom. Because of this I started wetting myself. And I'd be too scared to tell her so one of my class mates would have to do it. Then she'd yell at me some more and I'd be sent to the office to get a spare uniform.

This happened so regularly that the nurse would pull out a spare uniform if she saw me coming. One time I went to the office for something else, and she congratulated me on not wetting myself for an entire week. I got a little certificate. That's how bad it was.

The school got my mam to take me to a doctor. Who told her there was absolutely nothing wrong with me.

I also started to get nightmares about my teacher. Bad ones.

Within 3 months, a third of the students in my class had been pulled out to go to different schools because of this teacher, my best friend included. My mam eventually got a new job and we were able to move. On moving schools my bladder issues miraculously vanished, although the nightmares stuck around for awhile.

Fuck you, Mrs. Louden. Fuck. You.

The first thing was the fact she didnt know anything about English or general knowledge.  She had us write a paper on irony for the class but her examples of irony was when a character in a movie said "the agony of defeat."  Another character responds then why dont you take your shows off if the da-feet hurt so much. Yes, she thought irony was simply a play on words.

She also grew up in Texas and didn't know that Louisianan was a border state or even close to Texas.  She thought Sacagawea was the name of a board game.  Those are just a few examples that I can remember off of the top of my head. 

The worst thing though was the fact that she had zero control over the class.  Nobody listened to her and talked the whole time.  Instead a disciplining people she would just start crying and tell us how hurtful and rude we were being.  Then she would leave the class room for 15 to 30 minutes.  

Needless to say she was only that one year. |-|

I ended up compiling several assignments where I did A work &amp; got a C or lower. I then put it in a paper, gave it to him, and said "if you don't start grading fairly, I will give this to an admin". 
He stopped then, but I've been told that he still grades people based off bias, with people getting the same results. You would think he would learn, but NO, he just does what he does.

After that, I made sure to ask people if they would like something, and give them one or two options before I buy it. If they say they just want money, I apologise and walk away.

- made me stand on my desk in front of class while she pulled my pants down.  Still have no idea what i did to deserve that.  She'd walked out for a sec and when she returned, just grabbed my arm, dragged me out of my chair, told me to climb on the desk, then pulled my pants down.

- even though half the class told her otherwise, she insisted i was the one making that [finger-cheek poppy noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgzyaEz4mC4).  She made me do that **constantly** for 15 minutes.  Before 2 or 3 minutes was up, my hand was bloody.  After 5 minutes, i had a blood/saliva foam dripping off my elbow onto the floor kids near me were getting upset.  Mrs. Pugh yelled at the class, threatened the protesters with a similar punishment and made me finish.

Stupidly (you know, like a first grader), i tried to keep the blood/saliva foam off my clothes so there wasn't any proof about the severity.  And, being the early '70's, not only were corporal punishments more corporal, teachers had way more autonomy and parents had more trust in classroom decisions.

Mrs. Pugh was easily 50+ so i'm sure she's dead by now.  But i hope it was an awful awful death.  I hope she got the most painful cancer possible, her family got tired of caring for her, she was pushed to the street and died in a gutter in the middle of the night, soaked, cold, covered in sleet and even her dog left her at the end *(but poked out her eyes with its dick first)*.  Fuck that evil piece of shit cunt.

edit: in retrospect, i never went through the paste-eating phase and can't recall any other kids doing so, so maybe Mrs. Pugh's methods made sense after all. |-|

me: "I'm sorry… I recognize that you are asking for a specific thing, but you never explained what you meant by an essay."

me: "No"

her: "Well, then you're fucked, and I'm not going to help you."

After about a week of not turning in my homework because I didn't get it, she made me stay after school and do 100 long division problems. I was there until after 5 pm. My mother was worried sick, calling the school. Mrs. Rase made me feel stupid and useless. Thank goodness I had a wonderful 4th grade teacher who told me I was smart and let me shine. Since then, I have tested into MENSA and gone on to great things, but I will never forget how my 3rd grade teacher almost ruined school for me. Children need to be lifted up, not beat down. |-|

From when we were friends, to when we dated, to when we had fights and even in the last few months of our relationship/friendship. It was a lot of fun. I miss the all the stupid MSN conversations we used to have all day and all night long. I miss having you around sometimes. But I think we both agreed that we were better off being away from each other, but who knows when we'll ever see each other in person.

I don't know where you are or what you're up to, but I hope you're well. I hope you're having fun at school, I hope you met someone new and hes treating you better than I did (I really screwed the pooch in our relationship) and I hope you get all that you've ever wanted. 

There was the time where I thought about you everyday and cried or just slipped into depression (which was only a few months ago...) but I'm no longer in that place, so in case you worried about me at all, you don't have to. I'm fine. I'm very happy.



P.S. If you're ever near King Street East on a weekday for whatever reason, keep an eye out for me. Say hi. There's a neat little coffee shop next door to my college so I'll buy you a muffin if you'd like.

I didn't get them until the start of fourth grade because I had my little brother *steal them from her.* 

Or how about the day she made fun of me because I didn't have snowpants. In the northern states, you're required to have snowpants in order to go out for recess, but I came from Texas that year and they were sold out. I was lucky to have a warm coat.

|-| cnxnroy || 10 || Fuck you, Brittany. You swine. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. You are a canker, an open wound. I would rather insert a glass tube in my urethra and smash my penis with a hammer than be seen with you. You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, and a weasel. I take that back; you are a festering pustule on a weasel's rump. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a greasy parasitic bottom feeder. 

I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformity. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. You are a technicolor yawn. And did I mention that you gave me scabies? That was a fun 3 months! (/s) 

You are a squeaking rat, a mistake of nature and a heavy-metal bagpipe player. You were not born, You were hatched into an unwilling world that rejects the likes of you. You didn't crawl out of a normal egg,
either, but rather a mutant maggot egg rejected by an evil scientist as being below his low standards. Your alleged parents abandoned you at birth and then died of shame in recognition of what they had done to an unsuspecting world. They were a bit late.

 Your vileseome existence nauseates me beyond compare. Given a choice of stepping in something nasty on the sidewalk or bidding you good morning, I would happily choose the former. I wouldn't even piss on you if you were on fire. Single-handedly, you have wrenched all meaning out of life. Congratulations. 

 As I write this, I try vainly to think of something, anything, which redeems in some small way your utterly pointless existence. The only thing that comes to mind is that you have taught me hate. Pure, unmitigated hate. You, misguided as you are, might be asking yourself what you have done to deserve such a message as this. Your misdeeds and villainous vampings can be described in just two words: you exist. And believe me, there is no reason on earth why you should. 

 If everything in this world has some purpose, some grand plan behind its existence, then yours surely is to show everything else, whether it be a slops bucket in a fried chicken stand, or the gunk behind the fridge, how fortunate it is not to be you. I have tried, but clearly, I have failed. I must stand firm to the realisation that mere words cannot express my utmost and profound contempt and loathing for your person, your being and your existence. You are a blight against nature.

We had a paper due on a Monday, but I was going to be touring a college so I tried to turn it in Friday, explaining my situation. She said she didn't take papers early and to turn it in Wednesday (when I'd have her class again). I turned it in early online, then I turned my hard copy in on Wednesday. She took off 30% for it being late. My dad came to my defense because admin didn't care what I had to say. There was a meeting between me, the VP, the school counselor, and my dad. She tried to lie and say I was a bad student, but that lie didn't work since I had an A in her class. I ended up getting the 30% back and earned a 100% on this 15-paged nightmare of a paper.

Another instance (same teacher) wrote "Group Anal." on the board for "Group Analysis" and obviously some students thought it was funny and took pictures for instagram, etc. She told the VP that we were sexually harassing her and threatened us and the school with legal charges.

TL;DR my high school English teacher was a psycho

|-| cnxob4f || 12 || Every year in every class he taught, he would pick a student as a victim. When I say victim, I mean *victim*. If you got a bad grade, he'd personally attack you (verbally), beyond the point of crying. I had heard rumours about him from friends in higher classes, turns out, they were his victims in their classes. Most of his victims would storm out of the classroom and just sob elsewhere on the school grounds, when he turned his sights on me, I cried, definitely. But I refused to leave the classroom, I looked him in the eyes whilst he called me 
&gt;'stupid'

&gt;'dumb'

&gt;'lazy'

&gt;'a waste of time and government money'. 

This would happen several times a year to each victim, for me it initially happened almost every other lesson, then, *every* lesson. I did indeed get bad grades, but can you blame a 15 year old kid whom's parents were going through a rough divorce? A kid who had just had a car accident in which the other party bled to death in front of their eyes? (For which I still bear the guilt to this day) These events were well known amongst my teachers, seeing as my therapist (which I already had before the accident) personally had contact with my dean. Regardless of how much and often I studied, I couldn't get my grades up.

My friends would help me study and in the end say 'you know it better than I do', but the moment I'd step into his classroom, I got smothered by the hostility and couldn't do anything but black out. He'd just assume I didn't study, assume I didn't have it in me. I got 8/10's and 9/10's in German, before I got him as a teacher. My therapist said my experiences with him only increased my performance anxiety, beyond levels she had seen in her career. My classmates were too afraid to step in and stop him, even my regular bullies didn't dare. I don't blame them.

Even if you were well behaved, and tried your best, if your grades weren't to his liking, he'd take your desk, put it in the front of the classroom underneath the chalkboard and ignore you for the rest of the class. This happened to me at least once, and made me feel degraded and a second-rate human being.

Near the end of the year, I got so fed up with him and his practices. At some point, he *boasted* in class that one of his previous students had put him on his personal hit-list and had performed an attempt on his life. I don't blame that kid either.

I stepped to my dean, explained to her how and what, she told me 
&gt;'We'll take care of it.'.

The stupid cow set me up for a one-on-one meeting with the teacher, and it took many friends to convince me to leave my pocketknife at home in this period leading up to the meeting. To this day I still have no idea if I could have done something to him, but I sure wish I did, seeing as I keep hearing more stories of children being severely bullied by him. 

In the meeting, he sat me down and started with 
&gt;"Let me just make this clear; I'm not here to be your friend. I don't care if you call me an asshole, I'm here to teach you German."

I remember balling up my fists so hard I dug my nails into my own skin, drawing blood. I had to block out the rest of the b.s. that was coming out his mouth in order not to strangle him. 

Bonus points to me; I never had a foul word in my mouth regarding him, not until that point.

After that, I was supposed to *just* finish my year in his class. I wanted to become a translator for which, amongst others, I needed German. At some point I had five 1's for his tests in a row, my self-confidence was nothing more than a puddle of tears he wrang out of me. At the end of the year, I passed with an impossible 5 on my report card. Apparently, the moment he heard I decided to drop German, he'd let me slide 'because he's a nice guy like that'. He still gives me nightmares at 22, he still makes me feel insecure after not having seen him since 17, he's still teaching at that fucking backasswards school.

When I left that school, I understood why he got the nicknames 'The Nazi Lehrer' and 'NSB'er'. (Even the janitors didn't like him and they were super chill.)

The only reasons he was never fired? He had a 'high grade turnover' and tenure. Fucking *tenure*. At a *high school*.

He'd give them better marks, would let them skip band practice and was pretty disgusting.  He was also a complete pushover, who deserved zero respect.  He gave me a C+ and an S for effort/attitude one term, and I confronted him about it.  I had received PERFECT marks on ALL my theory and playing tests, yet he gave me a C+.  He said it was because I had a bad attitude.  I said "that's what the attitude/effort mark is for, and I'd have the principal look over my test scores.  He marked me back up to an A.  Finally, one day in band practice, I was being disruptive, and he called me into his office to kick me out of the band.  I cheered, ran out of his office and celebrated all the way home.

The girl was telling us about her grandma, of whom was Chinese. Being the logical 8 year old, I said *"Chinese people have weird eyes"*. The trainee teacher, wielding 3 inch ear stretchers, grabbed 8 year old me by the arm, and violently dragged me to the Headteachers office. I had marks on my arm, and had clearly been assaulted. She didn't 'guide me in the direction', she fucking dragged me.

She got fired in the end, for shouting at me for something I didn't understand. I was young, so I didn't acknowledge the fact that she physically assaulted me, so didn't report her for it. Obviously I had no intent to be racist.

Luckily, I decided to not lot her get to me and I continued on to finish the honors track, studied abroad in Ecuador in high school and Barcelona in college.

|-| cnxoou5 || 2660 || There's a supervisor in my office who's really socially awkward. She'll often start leaving the room before finishing what she's saying, so that she gets the last word on a conversation and can leave immediately after saying her piece. It makes it very difficult for anyone to question her, especially when she's made decisions everyone else disagrees with.

I like to prevent her by doing this by politely asking lots of questions while she's still awkwardly stood in the doorway. For an uncomfortably long time. She definitely wants to leave. Every minute of this conversation is tearing her up inside. And I love it.

EDIT: Just a quick note to those telling me this is shitty behaviour - I do realise that this is sort of a dick move, and I thought that was pretty much the point of OP's question. But also, this person routinely takes things out on others, is quick to pass off blame for her own mistakes and indecision, and routinely makes people feel uncomfortable and bullied with her attitude. It is a small (and rather satisfying) measure of revenge, rather than any attempt at victimising her. |-|

|-| cnxosuk || 5 || I'll say this goes both ways. 

I was homeless for the better part of three years (age 18-21). The only shelter I was eligible for would often fill up really fast, and was on the far side of town. Because of this, I often slept at parks, or a friend's couch if they were feeling generous for the night. My parents fell under the "no help because ENABLING" category.

I busked everyday to survive. Food ALWAYS came first, but in complete honesty, I was a smoker, about a pack a day. But still, food was always the most important goal of the day. Since I was younger than the local homeless, I got a bit of a better time. People would come up to me and say "At least you're doing -something- to get by, not just sitting on the ground and looking pitiful." I always tried to smile, because playing music for people made me genuinely happy. On an average day, I would make about 20 dollars. Enough to get some food (BTW, if you're giving food to the homeless, for god's sake give them a fresh sandwich. I cannot tell you how sick I got after the third cheeseburger/beefy 5 layer from taco bell of the day. I don't mean to say homeless people are picky, I'm saying their diets are TERRIBLE, so try to give something on the healthy side.)

Also in complete honesty, if I made a bit more money, yeah I would buy a 40 or a three pack of tall cans or whatever was cheap. Being perpetually homeless is a REALLY depressing ordeal. The overwhelming feeling of being a constant failure, having a feeling in your gut that you may be a beggar until you die puts a heavy toll on your psyche. In a lot of cities, yes, there are many resources for these people. But ask yourself: say you only make 5-6 dollars that day; what do you spend it on? That toothpaste and toothbrush you desperately need? Food you desperately need? How about a buss pass to the shelter? If so, how do you get back to your begging-spot the next day? There are so so so many factors that people never consider.

To sum it up, use your best judgment. If there's a beggar who looks to be in alright shape, give him a dollar or buy him a sandwich. Either way, you're bringing happiness to someone who is literally in the pit of despair. If you're feeling adventurous, ask them what they need. MANY will tell you "I could honestly use some deoderant/a water/a sandwich/a bus pass etc". To me, this is the best way to go about it.

tl;dr put yourself in someone elses shoes

edit: To clarify, you won't really ever know if your dollar goes to a beer or food. DON'T LET THIS DETER YOU. To this day, because of my experiences, whenever I see someone truly in need, I give them spare change. I don't know what they will buy with it, but knowing I made their day better is what's really important to me. It's sounds cheesy, but it's true: A little faith in humanity will make you a lot more optimistic in a really awful situation. |-|

Sorry we don't have anymore, you'll have to figure it out. Well I did. I found someone who would lend me their book when she was done and aced all the tests and homework despite not being at their level at my previous school. 

That cunt still failed me because I didn't do the mid term. Ended up having to take it to the school board where I think they really just felt sorry for me and over turned my grade.  |-|

|-| cnxpf9n || 3 || Had an English teacher in college who never, I repeat, NEVER had one lecture where he didn't go off on some tangent that was completely unrelated to the class. The teacher wasn't a dick or had any sort of personality disorder that made him difficult to be around, he just couldn't stay on topic for the life of him so 95% of the time you were left wondering whether his tangents had some abstract relation to the material we were supposed to be covering or if he was just chatting with the class.

Also, aside from the random tangents, he also had a terrible habit of forgetting that he assigned assignments (it was a pretty commom occurence to show up to class with homework only to have him forget that he assigned it) or we would show up to class thinking there was no homework or essays due only to have him come into class and ask for us to turn in some assignment he never assigned. Another thing that was pretty annoying and made his class unusually frustrating was that he was really knit picky when it came to grading papers. What made this so annoying was because of his tangents that I mentioned earlier. Because of his bad habit of going on tangents, no one ever really knew what he was expecting from our essays and on top of that, he never let us pick our essay topics. Instead, he would have a premade of 7-8 random topics that were either a pain to research, or they were such a polarized issue (for example, on a position paper one of the topics we got to choose from was "Should professional athletes be paid more than doctors and other professionals?") it made researching the opposing viewpoint and making it long enough to be 7-8 pages extremely difficult. I really don't think I ever learned anything from that class and something like 80% of the class ended up failing or dropping by the end of the semester. Yes, the teacher still works at the college last I checked.

For bitchiest teacher who I simply despised being around, that would go to an Analysis of Form teacher (its basically a still life drawing class that was required for first semester art students at the art school I went to) I had my fjrst semester at school. For whatever reason, she decided she didn't like me one bit within the first week (looking back, I think it is because I have a cartoony, simple style (I was an animation major too) while most of the other students were fine arts or illustration and were used to working in realism) and as a result, basically reported me and a couple other students who were coincidentally animation majors too to the tutoring center after the first 3 classes (which I think is hardly enough time to gauge how good a student is and can set a bad tone for that student for the rest of the semester.) Unfortunately for me, it was basically impossible for me to go to any of the tutoring or workshops because my classes happened to overlap them perfectly and any free time I had had to be spent in labs (for people who haven't studied animation, animation takes fucking forever to do if you want to do it well). Despite telling her the difficulty I had fitting some of her requests into my schedule, she started singleling me out in class instead by either lecturing the class about why my art sucked, or she would have other students in class during critique only point out what they didn't like (the critiques were supposed to be balanced where you would say what did and didn't work) and if they tried to point out something they liked, she would quickly shut them down and explain why it sucked. I had a friend who I sat next to in class too who drew about the same level of realism as me and she praised everything he did. I just seriously don't understand what that teacher's problem was with me. |-|

At the university I attended, the homeless would come inside and sit in the food court to get out of the cold/warm depending on the season. These guys would hang out there until it was time to find the nearest shelter. Though they never asked for money, I knew that they had problems. I would sometimes spend a bit to buy one a piece of pizza or a sub from subway and always got a thankful look. I never had issues with them pestering me for the most part. One winter I saw one of these homeless individuals sleeping outside under a cardboard box. I went and took him one of the extra blankets I had and didn't use very often. He hugged me and cried. It was probably one of the best experiences in my life.

But no, I do not give money because I don't know what they are spending it on. I rather give the person something they can use and not allow them to make poor choices that sometimes happen with these individuals. In this way I know that they are getting a bite to eat or keeping warmer than they were. |-|

One day, she was talking about the formation of Israel and about how, shortly after the country was formed, the United States donated several nuclear weapons to them. Then she went on to claim that we also gave nuclear weapons to Egypt and Palestine.

I have one final memory of this woman that will stick with me forever though. One day, she decided to start complaining about that lack of a teacher's union at the school. She started sharing a story about how she berated this new, younger teacher for not trying to create a union. It all seemed remarkably out of place, especially since she bookends every discussion with a lesson about how every source is politically slanted in some way. The most astounding part, however, was yet to come.

The school year was focused on the study of non-fiction works about the holocaust. So as she's complaining about how the school board ignores the teachers opinions, someone comments about how backwards that was. After all, there are more teachers than school board members. Her response floored me. She said, no exaggeration, "Well there were a lot more Jews than there were SS Officers, but that didn't stop them."

Everyday was an exercise in control for me, I really do think she is the only teacher I've ever truly disliked. 

Bonus story:
A friend of mine in the same school had a German teacher who taught the class about the evils of Adolph Hilter. For a time he legitimately believed the WW2 German dictator was named Hilter. Now that I look back on it, that school wasn't very good.

They paid their fees, went to their classes, saw me once a month without rescheduling a few times, and generally were polite. This was a rare type of offender and I was thankful for each of them. 

I did have a soft spot for this one guy who kept testing positive for cocaine though. It was odd, the guy never had a drug charge and was on probation for a domestic violence incident. Completely clean record before his arrest, respectable job. A few months into his term, he started testing hot for cocaine on random UI's. He swore up and down he wasn't using coke, and kept failing tests. 

We were grilling him telling him he was going back to court because of it, and he finally breaks down. "I'm *not* using it. I'm *selling* it. I don't wear gloves when I bag it. But there's no other way to pay all of these bullshit fees!" 

Poor fuck, got into an argument with his wife over money, wound up getting arrested, resorted to selling (and probably using) drugs to pay the bills, wound up with a harsh as fuck sentence for it. He was part of the reason I got out of the system.  |-|

|-| cnxpuq0 || 3 || I had a crazy neurotic cunt in 3rd grade who's job was to teach us handwriting.  I tried my best on every damn assignment and never got higher than a C-, which only happened a couple of times.  I was a straight A student.

She never tried to help me and didn't make herself available to help the students, she didn't even walk around the room to see if they were doing it correctly.  She'd sit at her desk and work on other projects.

This completely destroyed my self-esteem, which at the time was very tied up in my grades because I'd just moved schools and didn't know anybody very well.

By the end of the year you can tell by looking at my notebook that I had completely stopped trying to have nice penmanship.  I could give 100% or 0% and the difference was a couple of points. Sometimes, if I tried my hardest, my grade would actually be lower than if I'd phoned it in.

The funniest story from that year came later.  I had come down with strep throat, which happened very often (I was cursed with gargantuan tonsils) and due to this I was sleeping so often that I didn't finish one of my handwriting assignments before I went back to school.  My mother did it for me, trying to keep me out of trouble.  **MIIIISSSTTAAAAKE!!!**

The teacher immediately recognizes it's not my handwriting and has me stay in the room and re-do the assignment while everyone else is at recess and she starts criticizing me about how I never try, and I was stupid if I thought I could get away with it, and *blah, blah, blah.*

Bitchface didn't know that my mother was right outside the room bringing me my antibiotic for the day and heard everything she said.  So she walks into the room, sees me in tears, asks me to wait in the hall and verbally threatens the ever-loving shit out of that axe-wound.  When I finally came back in the room I'd never seen that dickhole so pale and her hands were fucking shaking, I'll never forget that.

My grades never improved but I didn't really care, that woman was fucking terrified of my mother.  She really went to the plate for me that day.  She's the best.

That teacher?  I dunno what happened to her, I just hope she's a lonely divorced alcoholic, or she's dead.  She definitely had no business teaching students.

|-| cnxqd61 || 943 || My older sister is kinda bitchy, especially when we were younger..partly because she was the oldest and only girl among 3 boys.

Well we used to be up "late" (like 10-11pm) because that was when Simpsons reruns were on and she would be asleep down the hall in a split bedroom house. She would constantly keep coming out of the room telling us to turn down the volume on the tv and watch us do it, saying it was keeping her up. We knew she was just wanting to be a total nitpick because at the point she was happy was when it was turned down to a point where we could barely hear it 5 ft away. Her room was all the way down a 30 ft hallway behind closed doors so we knew she was just listening for sounds to be bothered by or just hated our enjoying ourselves...who knows what makes bitchy people bitchy.

So what I started doing, was when she came out to tell us to turn it down, I would turn it down 2 notches like normal. Right as she shut the door to her room, I would turn it up about 4 notches so that it wouldn't be noticeable over the noise of her shutting the door. She would come out about 3-4 more times (like every night with about 2-3 minutes between each visit) and I would do the same thing. On the 4th or 5th time, I would turn it down to the original listening volume that we knew we liked to listed to the tv at, since you kind of keep track of that when you use a tv long enough. Because I had gradually gotten her used to a volume that was ACTUALLY annoyingly loud, the drastic drop to normal levels gave her enough time to fall asleep before her ears readjusted.

I did tell her now that we were adults and I thought she would find it funny. Apparently there is still a bitch inside of her because she was not happy to find out she was manipulated like that! |-|

|-| cnxqgak || 17 || I never had this teacher... Well because I was never in special ed classes. I heard this from a friend, who got in trouble and witnessed the whole thing. 

The assistant teacher for special ed classes. She was secretly really mean to the kids with special needs. Sometimes kids who were bad would get sent to her room (for whatever reason). My friend got in trouble that one day and was sent to her room. As he was in the room, the assistant teacher was being mean to the kids, while the actual teacher wasn't there. So after being mean, the assistant teacher left the class. This one special needs kid obviously had enough. He got up, went to her desk, unzipped his pants, whipped out his penis and stuck it in her coffee. He went back to his desk and later on she came back in and had a sip of her coffee.

For an embarrassingly long period of time I came close to a panic attack whenever I even heard your name or saw a picture, and being in the same room as you was almost intolerable. The last time that happened was 2010 and I left the party the moment you walked in. 

But when I saw that pic accidentally on Facebook I finally realised with huge relief I'm not even vaguely troubled by seeing you any more. For the first time since I realised you were cheating on me with him, I don't care. 

And I'm honestly happy that he and you and the two kids (I presume it's two by now - you looked pregnant again in the picture) are doing fine. You looked like you had a great Christmas.

In a perverse way I have to thank you, because the circumstances into which you catapulted me were indirectly responsible for me meeting the love of my life. So, strangely, thanks for doing what you did. |-|

They came to play in my local town and my female friend, aged about 18 or 19, got talking to the bass player after the show. He seemed like a nice guy, and said e hanging around the next day, so she said she'd meet him for a drink that afternoon. So he brings her around Galway, buys her lots of Tom Waits CDs (cos she'd never heard him), brings her to dinner in a nice restaurant. Given age difference and fact that he was married, she genuinely never thought he was being anything but friendly. Eventually he made his move. She was horrified and left in tears. At the time I thought she was extremely innocent to accept all that free stuff without suspecting his intentions. But now I think back, she was a kid and he was a little bit sleazy. Because she was not a good looking or a confident girl by any means. He was in his thirties and married to Trisha Yearwood at the time. Just checked on Wikipedia. They divorced a year later.

You think I don't know. You think I still want you back, dream on.

**To the serious ex** (yeah thats right most recent ex, we weren't serious) - When I went to *city omitted for reasons*, to go see you and your family, a trip i booked before we broke up. Your Father called me, asking for me to go to dinner with him and your Mother. I met them and after some persuasion I told them everything. This is when I found out you lied to them, to their face, about what you did and you still don't think any of us know. Both of your parents cried, a lot, because what you didn't know was that whilst you were away on work (and fucking some other guy), I had already been to see your parents in *city omitted for reasons*. 

I had asked them permission for your hand in marriage and they both gave me their blessings, your Father even called me his son in his broken Spanglish. I went with your Mother to buy an engagement ring and your Father had even organised a venue for the Engagement Party (the same building your baptism party was held in, that your Father architected and built). I was flying over to propose to you, your whole family knew. You'll probably never know how much you hurt me, or your parents. You lied to all of us. Thats even more shitty than the cheating. Your Father still emails me to this day to find out how I am, 3 years on. You still haven't told them, it's eating him up. Just fucking come clean, you dick.

It made her a bad teacher because beyond the fact that she spent time flirting when she should have been teaching, it also made for a horrible classroom experience.  You knew it was wrong but had nothing to really go on to stop it or complain- so instead you just had to watch, and it was sick.

|-| cnxr7di || 21 || You're the worst.  You emotionally abused me to the point where I felt like I couldn't move forward with any of my goals or aspirations.  Would it have killed you to see me perform once in the 6 years we were together?  Did you really have to call and text me whenever I was somewhere else without you just to check and make sure I wasn't talking to any girls?  Anytime an opportunity to tour with my band came up, you broke down crying because you couldn't handle being without me for a week.  It also really sucked when I had the opportunity to join a signed touring act, and you broke down crying because I would have the gall to follow my dreams and passion.  You could always make jokes about me and my friends, but the second the joke was about you, you broke down.  I had to spend the rest of the night consoling you.  Every.  Fucking.  Time.  When you found someone more financially stable than me, you left me for them immediately.  It really didn't help when that person was our roommate.  That person was a really good friend of mine too, now that friendship is completely ruined.  I know they wouldn't have pursued it either without you pushing it, because that's what you do.  You push to get whatever you want, regardless of what it does to those around you.  So much so that you didn't want to move out of the house.  You stayed there in the room next to mine.  So good job, you got me to move out of my house.  Also, please tell your mom that I'm sorry, but I don't want to ever get back with you. The worst part, I'm so hesitant to post this because if you do read it, it's going to hurt your feelings.  You really are the worst. |-|

I don't still love you.

I don't still miss you.

You broke my trust, and hurt and damaged me more deeply than you could ever fathom, or you wouldn't have done so in the first place.

But I've moved on, completely.  I'm in a good, healthy place, emotionally.

Part of me still wants to ask 'Why?', but I know there's no answer you can really give.  And realistically, it'd just be curiosity at this point.

I do hope life has treated you well.  Because we were friends, once.  I hope you've found happiness, and also hope you haven't hurt someone else the way you did me.

No one deserves that.

Goodbye. |-| 
|-| cnxr9qm || 3 || Just like to say thanks for ruining me for the last 6 years of my life of being single. Just to let you know that I'm finally happy with my life and found my passion as a cna while you cheated on me and left me for a red neck who ended up giving you the clap annnnnnnd cheated on you with his ex and working at a low paying job being miserable.  I'm glad the last 3 years of me living in NY changed who I am and the last year I finally met new friends who actually care about me and make me honestly happy.  On another thing, ask your mom to stop calling me about why I'm not with you anymore. I'd tell her the truth but I wouldn't like to hurt her.  Haz nice day!  |-|

You cheated on me emotionally and did it in the same house i was paying for you to live in basically scot-free...and that money i was using on the house was from the life insurance when my mom died. I completely wasted it on you and you were too busy to even care.

I hope that you've forgiven me. You know that I never meant to, but that doesn't really change much, does it? Sometimes I wish I could see you, catch up, and chat a little and continue as we do. I heard that you started school, I hope that you are enjoying it and I already know you will excel. I am well, busy but very satisfied with where I am. I think I've finally forgiven myself too, I think I've finally let everything go. I guess you predicted this and I tried to avoid it, but I met someone and I am happy. I want to thank you for all the things you taught me and for helping me become a better person. I don't know if you still hate me, but I hope that's not the case. I wish you the best with everything. I hope that you are happy.  |-|

|-| cnxrfq8 || 255 || There was one guy that offered free protection to older inmates. Younger gang bangers were trying to charge older folks. People who had been in the system before often adhere to a code an part of that is that old timers (**edit to add** physically frail looking, time in prison is often just...frozen or very relative, so this could include an 85 year old man or a 50 year old man who is about to die from all his chronic medical conditions) are left alone.   

I was able to verify it was free because a few of the old timers were on my caseload (I was a prison social worker/therapist). Months and months passed, he never requested payment. **EDIT AGAIN** It was particularly astonishing because the old guy was a child molester and the dude knew it. Dude offering protection said it was just the code, and hated seeing younger guys behaving like "wild animals" (HIS TERM not mine) more than he hated the other dude's crime. I was worried it would turn into a huge problem because the guy offering protection would ask for payment eventually because of the guy's crime but he never did. This dude was sort of unfuckwithable, his manslaughter charge was because he punched a man two times and that man died. His hands were bigger than his head and he was sort of psychotic...but yeah.  |-|

I'm sorry I was a stupid kid and didn't think about how my actions would affect others. I'm sorry I wasn't kinder. I'm sorry we had to end that way.

His son is 2 years below me and has been in a mobility scooter for like 5 years. He never really talks to people and is a bit of a social outcast. He needs a teacher with him at all points during the day to open doors etc.

Now, the reason this teacher is weird is because he always goes on about "gassing the disabled because theyre a drainage of resources and time". He often used this as a debate topic in class. The students who opposed it were more or less ignored by him altogether. I think he wishes his son never existed. I didnt really learn a lot in his class... |-|

There is a homeless shelter opposite and a lot of the homeless people hang about around here. The wind kept blowing my "Hello Robots!" sign around, folding it over. Most of the day was spent with homeless people cheerfully shouting "Hello Robert!" into my window.

After the gig I went to get some chips (fries!), came back and Dee Plume was having a cigarette. The tour bus was next to my front door. I offered her a chip and she came over. We sat on the steps outside my flat sharing cheesey chips. She was very nice and not-sarcastically impressed with my "Hello" sign.

The engine started, she kissed me (with the same mouth she uses with Noel Fielding) on the cheek and ran back onto the bus. Then I went inside and discovered that I'd started baking a potato six hours previously and forgotten about it. Everything smelt of potatoes.

|-| cnxrsuk || 7 || It's been 18 years since we first stared into each other's eyes. I loved you and who you were. You were a nerd, just like me. We would recite quotes from movies, like others should finish each other's sentences. We loved each other like mad. 

I left for school, and you struggled. You needed companionship. You had cheated on me with someone else, and could never forgive yourself. I wish you knew that I could look past that. I moved along in life, thinking I could move past. Every time we would see each other, it would slap each other in the face. 

The first time we saw each other after our break up, you and I were at a party. You would finish my sentences, and I would finish yours. We realized our favorite movies in the last few years were the exactly the same. When we saw each other, it was like we were back to the day before shit went down. I loved it, but you self destructed. You danced for me, and realized you were still in love with me. You had a lot of meaningless relationships. But you feared love. You snapped that night, and tried to break my heart so I wouldn't break yours first. I forgive you. 

We saw each other once again. The night I was almost killed by a friend. You couldn't stop staring in my eyes. And I realized that a name I had taken upon myself between our last meeting, you somehow knew and gotten a tattoo of the creature. You fought your love of me every step, and I didn't know how to make you stop. You pushed away again. And I left forever, so I thought. I forgive you. 

I ran 2000 miles away, but that still was not far enough. Somehow, we passed ways so far away From where we started and saw each other. We both broke down, and within minutes you ran out of the store. I forgive you. 

My heart couldn't take it any longer. I met someone online and fled to be with someone I thought loved me. I fled 3000 miles, into another country. I thrived on it, but it didn't last. The person thrived on my pain, and I realized how destructive it was. But I thought I had forgotten of you finally. I left my first wife, and meet someone who loved me unconditionally. I loved back as best I could, being broken thoroughly. 

We moved back to my original country, far away from anything before. I hadn't kept any friends for years from the time I was younger. We had a child together, and I started unwinding and finally becoming who I thought I was supposed to be. 

I was on Facebook one day, and looked at the side bar. Who was there as a suggestion, staring at me? My heart jumped, but I saw something. Your name had changed. Had you moved on, and had I moved on? 

I ignored it for weeks, but for some reason, even though I had no ties on Facebook you kept showing up in the side bar. I had to know, so I added you on Facebook, but I didn't say anything for weeks. Finally, I said hi, and you replied promptly. We discussed our lives, where we were, our marriages. It felt like we were over it. We started discussing favorite shows and talking in general. One day, you ask me 'So, you're over me?' Which I answer 'Yeah. You?' 'Yeah.'

We both knew we were both full of shit. Over time, I come to realize she married her husband because he was nothing like me. I married my wife because she was nothing like you. 

We had to see each other, almost 14 years after we first met eyes. We travelled a large distance each just to meet. And then, there we were, face to face. We knew. We knew right away. You cried and cried, and I knew what was coming. You were about to run again, after seeing each other for a few short moments. I started fighting for you, but to no avail. You were gone as fast you came. You called me on the road. You were worried you were killing me. I was worried I was killing you. We said we had to do this the right way. We kept talking for a while, not pushing anything. You broke, and couldn't stand talking to me without having me. You left me hanging. You told your husband, and he was furious. I told mine. She was lost. But you couldn't pull the trigger. I forgive you. 

You still pop back up into my life. You send me emails and call once in a while, but it is brief and far between. It's hard, knowing you're out there, but the ball is in your court now. 

You made a joke one day, that maybe one day we would meet in an retirement home, and we would be together as hilarious old people. And you know what, if I can have you then, so be it. 

I forgive you. I forgive you for what you've made me into. I miss you.  You are my drug. I'm a recovering addict. You're poison, and I'm your target. And that's okay. 

If you're reading this, and there is a good chance you will, this is what I want to tell you:

I only do it maybe once a fortnight, and I prefer to stick them on message boards, mirrors, and on people's doors. People have been trying to figure out where they're coming from and why the hell they're getting posted for a while now. There's this one dude in particular on my floor who has really been trying and he gets visibly miffed when he finds them on his door after a two minute bathroom break.

I was invited to the bus but declined, thinking it would be a good thing to instead slip him my number. I'm sure he went on to the next drunk college girl, which is fine.

&gt;WHY AREN'T YOU SINGING?  I'M CALLING YOUR PARENTS.  TAKE THIS TEXTBOOK TO YOUR CLASSROOM AND DO WORK OUT OF THIS INSTEAD OF WORK THAT ACTUALLY MATTERS.

&gt;Hey Matt, I heard you play guitar!  Maybe you could come and play it for us some time?

Well, after you yelling at me and my friends like that, I don't really feel inclined to in any way.

The favorite story though, is this:

In this music class, we were separated into color groups:  red, blue, green and purple I think.  I and most of my friends were in green and purple.  So when class is wrapping up, she says "Ok, everybody can go now."  *everybody.*  **everybody.**  ***everybody.***  I put emphasis on everybody because that's exactly what she said.

So then, everybody gets up, and she says, "I didn't say green and purple could go!"  She later came to our class and pulled all of us in green and purple out into the hallway (except the girls, who also got up might I add).  She told us, and I quote, "one day y'all are gonna be sittin' around in a circle where they're all smokin' marijuana and you all are gonna take a puff!"  We just got out of our chairs...  When she told us to...  So we were all pissed, we told our parents, and they all called this teacher.

The next day, she talked to our actual teacher about how "all these kids' parents are calling me and getting angry, when it's their own faults!"  In front of all of us...

She was also my neighbor, and she held this over my head all the time.  I wasn't scared, though, my mom knew about her shit.

|-| cnxs8z0 || 2340 || When I hate someone, I make sure to have it seem obvious to them that I could care less what's going on or what they have to say... then make sure in other company to really sing their praises... really go on about how much I admire this person... so when she is bitching about me to someone else, they think she's a terrible person. I'm slowly breaking a coworker this way. She can't figure out why she doesn't like me, people think she's such a bitch for hating on me, especially since I just think the world of her.  |-|

|-| cnxs9vk || 61 || You can tell when a prisoner is going to make your life hell right off the bat. I was a prison guard for about 8 years before I went back to school because it just was getting too hard to leave the shit behind when I went home at night.

Know when you meet someone and they just don't quite seem human? That was how I would describe three of the new arrivals we got in one week, nicknamed Subs, Snow, and Blaze. Yeah, real fucking original. Well these guys weren't exactly the creative type, even when they killed it was nothing fancier than a gun or a knife. 

Nothing was quite out of the ordinary, I was escorting the group in along with a few others along side my friend, let's call him Jon. He had been a guard for over 20 years and was sort of my mentor. Now, one thing to understand about prison is that reputation is the most powerful weapon you have. 

Jon had a reputation as the toughest, meanest officer in the prison. I had seen him chatting with some of the friendlier inmates many times, and he never abused his power, but when a fight broke out under his watch or an inmate tried some slick shit, he was the first to have his baton out laying them out. This earned him respect, if not fear from the population. Our new arrivals hadn't heard of him yet.

Snow stopped dead in his tracks, and I gave him a nudge in the back with the stock of my shotgun and ordered him to keep moving. He spun around and headbutted me, dazing me but not knocking me down, and Jon pounced with his baton. But the inmate had a shiv, god damn they can just pull those things out of thin air sometimes, and got Jon in the side twice. I recovered and tackled him to the ground, I got in his face, nose to nose, and asked him, "What the FUCK did you think you were going to do there?" ...He just smiled, blood leaking from his gums, and said, "Read the first word of every paragraph" |-|

We was strollin through the hood and saw one of our targets by himself and pulled up and my shift partner was like, "XXX wtf are you doing here?"

XXX was like, "My girl thinks I'm at my boys house watching the game but I'm up here bout to go fuck these hoes".

My shift partner: "Well then you better stop at Mickey D's on the way home and wash your dick in the sink!!!"

Hahaha we all was laughing. It was a good laugh too. 

Then a couple months later he became an inmate of the state for the bad things he was doing. He was one of the funny ones. |-|

You tried to force me to quit my job because you didn't want me around other guys. You hated my friends and called me to fight for hours every time I was with them. You guilted me into having sex with you when I told you I didn't want to. You were clingy and our relationship was beyond unhealthy, especially considering we were only 16. I'm glad to be rid of you, but I wish you hadn't taken our mutual friends with you. |-|

|-| cnxsopx || 1842 || This is not subtle at all, but my orchestra conducter is one of the funniest people I know. We, the whole orchestra, would go into the streets sometimes and follow people in a straight line.

Then we would stand around a garbage can and laugh at it, very loudly, and we wouldn't even fake it because it was just so funny.

Another time, we got in line behind an elder lady who was using a phone booth. She got so shocked when she finished her call and saw ~50 people waiting behind her.

We walked through a street market and our conductor asked a vendor: "How much is one rasperry?", the vendor smiled and answered: "Well, nothing." Our conductor grabbed a paper basket and said: "Brilliant. Everyone grab a raspberry and put it in here."

Every one of these operations were led by our conductor and I think he still is as silly as he used to be.

Edit: Remembered some more. 

We used to play snake in public spaces. Someone started walking around and we were all positioned randomly, and when that person walked up to another, they turned around and continued walking, bumped into a third, turned around and continued walking etc. and when finally everyone was walking, we stated making elaborate paths around people, encircling them or making shapes.

Then we would also walk to the shore of the lake (there is a lake in my town) where many couples used to watch the sun set, pick one out, and sit tightly around them, putting an arm around them too, generally resulting in a sort of group-hug. Our conductor would take a picture of us, then say "okay guys, up" and then we went on.

|-| cnxspur || 14 || Dude you need to quit fucking snap chatting mckenna. Stop. She doesn't respond with anything meaningful for a reason and she's not interested in you. Who am I? The man whom she is in love with. She already told me not to worry, she's not interested in you. Sorry I bothered you kid. I've dated her since 2 summers ago. If you aren't trying to get at my woman or being inappropriate I don't care if you snap her occasionally. Just don't try anything man. You'll embarrass yourself and anger me. We are in love and we're making love tomorrow. So if you have any ill intentions with my woman you can forget it right now. I'm the biggest and best she's ever had, only man she's ever loved and the only man who could truly satisfy her physically. You will never have her. And she loves me. I don't have any problems with you if you are over my woman and realize you will never be with or touch her again. I apologize for coming off as a dick, just me and kenna are really deep in love and we've been through a lot and I just moved back home and it makes me a little jealous and angry to see a man she used to date before me is snap chatting her.... We don't need any extra bullshit or drama right now, so don't bring us any please is all I ask friend. If you try to talk to her any way but as a brother, or you try to see her at all, if she tells me you do anything inappropriate or anything outside of what a strict brother like friend would do,we are going to have a huge problem. I will leave you alone now dude if you're not trying to get at the woman who I love and whom is in love with me. That entire summer she was with me. She left kyle for me. She's been with me ever since, she even loved me and made love to me before she EVER let anything happen with you. You didn't please her. She didn't have strong feelings for you at all. And she immediately ended shit with you for me once she knew I loved her too. So get any ideas of the past out of your head. None of this truth should bug you if you're over her but I'm just making sure. I hate when my baby's friends have ill intentions and she thinks they are just friends and have no alternative motive. But idk if I trust you at all. If I can trust you to not stress me and my baby or fuck with our love tell me. I will leave you alone and apologize. But if you aren't over her and you're tryna "get some" or you're tryna get back in her life, it's NOT HAPPENING. She said you were nothing to her, and the sex was bad anyway haha. You're small and weak and she said it all felt wrong after being with me. She's been with me ever since. We're in love. And tomorrow me and her will be together in my room making love alll day how we always have together. If you have a problem speak up like a man or tell me our love doesn't bug you and I'll apologize, it's simple. So??? What is it? You are after my woman then huh?! Tell me the fucking truth man. Don't you dare be disrespectful and gross enough to bring it up, but if if you ask her about anything she shared with me about your weak ass, she may be nice and lie to you, or she may not care and tell you the truth. Either way. I'm her soullmate and her boyfriend of the past two years almost. And she tells me everything and NEVER lies to me. I don't care haha. Just stay away from my kenna. I sincerely apologize if you have no ill intentions and aren't trying to make moves with my woman. And i respect you as a guy in the service. I'm sure you're an ok dude. But just as a friend. You're nothing to my kenna but a brother like friend. I just wanna be sure you know it and don't forget it. Find a nice classy woman where you are stationed, marry her.... But back off of mine. You will never even compare to me in her eyes. Not even close haha.I just don't need you interfering with me and kenna's love. It's our lives man. It's really not cool.... Goodbye man, good luck. Respect to you being in the service. Sorry to bring your day down with my crazy bullshit but. Me and kenna are head over heels.... I can't help but be crazy about her. I love her with all of my heart and I will protect her from her untrustworthy fake friends. Not saying you are one. But you're dodging telling me what's going on in your head so I'm questioning a lot right now. Just know I'm never gonna hurt her, I'm always going to have her back, I'd give my life for her without hesitation, and I will protect her from anything, everything, and anyone. She is the love of my life. I fully intend to marry and give kenna my children. And we've talked a lot about it. Just don't make shit harder than it already is. I just moved back and me and her miss eachother so badly and we are FINALLY go to see eachother tomorrow and make love for the first time since halloween.... I hope you don't hate me man. I'm a good dude. Just protective of the woman who holds my heart. And who's heart I hold and must protect. I hope you can understand. She promised me there's nothing at all to worry about with you and that she's not interested:"/ I wish I knew before I embarrassingly went off on you. I'm so sorry man. I'm sorry. Please don't mention this to my baby:/ I'm really embarrassed and while she will understand, I just feel like an ass for attacking you when you have nothing with my kenna and no intention to. Good bye brother. I hope you find your one true love someday. It'll make you crazy, trust me, but you'll find her one day. I found mine when I was really young. And it's my kenna :) |-| 
|-| cnxspza || 1208 || How I treated you is my biggest regret. Even though we likely would have broken up anyways I should have embraced our relationship more and helped us both grow from it instead of being the stagnant loser I was. I'm sorry that my stupidity caused more problems for you than it did for me. I'm thankful for everything you taught me, how many chances you gave me that I squandered, every time you saved my from myself and the real life love we had. I'm sorry that it took me losing/hurting you to realize how I needed to change.

Added Edit:

Holy Moly I didn’t expect so many replies. Thank you so much!  Also thank you very much to whoever gave me gold. I don’t know how to reply to personally but I’d love to. Thank you all for your replies. I’ve been feeling stagnant emotionally lately. Reading through the replies created a spectacular rapid of feelings. I appreciate it so much.  I’ll try to reply to everyone. If I can’t get through it all I’ll try my best to leave a worthwhile comment addressing any replies I can. Thank you all again.

It is quite possibly the most irritating thing that I will experience in the game but I usually don't say anything because they are entitled to play however they choose as long as they aren't physically touching the table, balls or myself.  In order to get back at them I wait until it is their turn, make sure that I am in their field of vision while keeping my distance from the table to make it clear that I respect their shot and then at the exact moment they shoot I will quickly look up at the television or something.  I ONLY do this against those types of players and it usually has a larger impact than their tactics. |-|

He would have funny little mean spirited back and forth with some of us students that liked to poke fun at him, just to make him more angry. My friend, we'll call him Kirt, decided to playfully mess with Mr.Poe one day before class by marking Mr.Poe's bald head with a black marker. He didn't make any specific mark it was just a streak. Mr.Poe smiles and says "See you at class Kirt". About an hour later in class, Mr.Poe comes in quietly , locks the door behind him, grabs Kirt out of his chair and slams him on the ground. With Mr.Poe's leg in Kirt's chest, he screams "I'll fucking kill you". Kirt apologizes out of fear, and the situation digresses. We're all horrified and don't say a word for the hour class. Mr.Poe is brought up on charges later and I testify against him. He was forced to retire early and lost some retirement money.  I never heard from either one again.  |-|

We were together for five years and change. We have now been broken up for six years. I don't think about you every day anymore, but it's still probably more often than not.

I'm married. I love my wife. I think somehow I still love you more. 

It was supposed to go away with time. I heard somewhere it takes half as long to as you were together to go away. I heard love is like a drug and you suffer withdrawals and then get better. Why isn't it true for me?

I'm sorry for all my shortcomings that drove you away. I am still that same flawed person in many ways.

I found you on reddit in a moment of weakness -- looked up your old username. I read a lot of your blog. You seem to be doing pretty well, and that made me really happy. I've managed to not read any more since.

I'm sorry. I would do anything to rewind and do it right. That's fucked up right? I miss you.

I love you. |-|

By the fact that you had to be worked up to the point to even want to have sex once a week, I knew you were no longer even attracted to me. Even after I started to change for you I realized it was too late, you were already gone inside, looking for someone else to make you happy. 

I tried to help you get out of your depression, even asked you if leaving me would help. Instead of telling me how I could help, you would only tell me you didn't know how you could be happy anymore. I'm not a romantic person and that did not make me love you less. 

I'm with someone else now, as you already know. We aren't perfect together all the time after she lost the baby, but she is honest and tells me what she needs while being realistic. I learned from being with you things not to do, which has helped me. So thank you for that at least.  |-|

|-| cnxt8n5 || 384 || Worked in a halfway house.  Not a prison, but worked with newly released prisoners.  The one I worked at was extremely high risk.  We got lots of murderers, sex offenders, just *bad* dudes.   It was pretty easy to dislike somebody who had a bad attitude.  But some guys had good attitudes but would still fuck up and be on the next bus back to temporary detention.  Like they'd get a good job, nice girlfriend, family support, start making money...then shoot heroin, lose their job, get busted, their girlfriend dumps them and they'd be back behind bars.  It sucks.

One guy who came in...I've only seen *three* guys in one year out of hundreds we had come and go that didn't breach in *some* way.  Guy was older, and always had a good attitude.  He was just done with the life.  Got up every day super early and went to work, despite being an older guy who can't handle work.  If you're on release, you will likely work temp labour so you don't have to tell your employer you're on parole.  Plus, nobody wants to hire them full-time.  

Guy was always on time for curfew.  Sure, we had it out every so often, but if you spend hours a day with somebody, you will bump heads.  I got another job, but on my last shift I helped him figure out shit with his phone, wished him best of luck and encouraged him to keep searching for his daughter.  She tried to track him down a few years back but he was in prison so he never got back to her and now he was out but he was ashamed of being inside, etc.  I basically told him, "Fuck that, you're her father, you're family."  

The one thing I miss about prisoners is you can be a lot more straight up with them than other people.  Everybody else in society needs things sugar coated.  These guys can take it straight.

|-| cnxtalq || 7 || Tl;dr - The world is a terrible place and human biology causes us to be shitty people and instead of pushing forward to a new future everyone's hiding in echochamber hugboxes like those rich girls who get Daddy to pay for everything, or worse- revelling in their own shitty destructive behavior like pigs rolling in shit.

The current whining rally against racism, sexism, the censorship of thought crimes and speech crimes, and any group who narrows their focus (SJW, MRA, KKK, ISIS) is short sighted, hypocritical, and self serving. Firstly, human biology limits our capacity to connect emotionally  (Dunbar's number) and humans will always draw an "us/them" line in the sand after 150 mental associations. There are no special snowflakes when everyone is a special snowflake. And those who can't survive on their own without public assistance are weak and would perish if any real global catastrophe ever happens. We've built a society of argumentative, selfish, short sighted irresponsible children who wouldn't last long in a Mad Max, The Road, alien invasion, robot uprising, enviromental disaster, or zombie plague.

Groups who rant on about inequality, diversity, triggers, privilage, and other such nonsense don't truly care about fixing the problem but removing the current top of the pyramid control grid and putting themselves on top to inflict the same sort of inequality and facism the people before them brought. Options should be available but the world won't stop and apologize because a picture or some words hurt your poor little feelers. The world was a dark brutal and unforgiving place long before humanity and while we should work on basic human kindness... this muted "equality" is the death of humanity.

To be clear, I think the "punishment/censorship" method is ineffective and inevitably just as damaging as what it seeks to combat. Society would be better served by fostering good, honest, compassionate, humane, generous, responsible, respectful, altruistic behavior and rewarding that instead of cherry picking punishment and torture to a select few rule breakers while the punishers themselves break the rules hypocritically. Reward gpod behavior, and damage control bad behavior.

Their traditional opposition is no better. Anyone who rants on about tradition and conservation is holding onto a dying stagnation. Things worked to get us here but staying here is death, things must change to build the species that comes after mankind. The greatest lie of mankind was that everything built up to this moment. We are only a build up to the next, and that is only a build up to the next after that. Religion and spirituality have their uses but they are used by humans, subject to human failings, and used as an excuse for human brutality and evil.

The future is a wave of change. We are on the brink of rewriting genetic code, uploading minds into digital backups, and engineering new physical forms for humanity. We are looking at post humanity now. Man? Woman? Gay? Straight? All choices to be engineered by those who wish to live them, not controlled by traditions or beauracrasies but offered as choice. We can have a world where people can build the bodies they want, and it's all being prevented and controlled by ego driven hypocrites who only care about whether they can control it in leiu of anyone else.

But we have a dependant society who can't live without the system and yet the system shows no interest in progressing us into the future promised by Star Trek, William Gibson, and Isaac Assimov. One side wishes to stagger and choke the future through control of action and destruction of everything except mankind while encouraging rampant irresponsible behavior, the other chokes and staggers the future from over coddling censorship of thought and speech while encouraging irresponsible refusal of consequences. |-|

People are homeless for a myriad of reasons, reasons that we are not privy to. I love talking to homeless people, and hearing their story. I have talked to those who are disabled veterans, people who just never took off, as well as a former VP from a major bank who lost all motivation when his family was killed by a drunk driver, he just could no longer function after that.

I'm stable, straight-laced, over 30 and sexual repression is years behind me but I keep getting this unwarranted sexual twinge that only ever lasts a moment.  Feel free to jump to any conclusion about my psychology but I have no doubt that this is some type of neuropathy.   |-| 
|-| cnxtu3a || 8 || In 1st grade, my teacher announced to the school that I was gifted as well as my IQ test result. She then moved me up 2 year levels (she was more vain than mean). In 2nd grade, my teacher would disregard any contribution I made to the class, publicly mock me, spread rumors about me and would blame everything (literally everything) on me. She would also intentionally force me to sit at the same table as the three people who bullied me. That occurred EVERY DAY. The principal would blame my bullying on me. The well-being officer would tell my parents about how awful I was. I can recall a day where a boy along with around 6 or seven others approached me and started attacking me. Full on punching and kicking. Being a fat little seven year-old, I scratched one of them and drew the tiniest little trickle of blood. I was sent home and the bullies got off punishment free. That sort of isolation sent me into suicidal depression. When I was eight. And I must say, eight-year-old boys are not supposed to want to kill themselves.

I should also point out that my grade 4 teacher, the only nice one in the school was fired. Why you ask? He walked in on the school priest molesting a boy. And I swear, this is not a joke. They made up some bullshit excuse about him pushing two children apart to break up a fight.

|-| cnxtulk || 2550 || I used to work in a pub that also had a drive through bottle shop.

I had to deal with a lot of rude customers, they would try rush me, have no manners and complain about the price, you know, the standard shit.

Stupid shit like: "Why is this 6 pack $18 when it's $17 at Dan Murphy's?!"

If you want to save 1 fucking dollar, drive to Dan Murphy's you dense fuck, don't yell at me instead.

Needless to say I would take my revenge when working in the bottle shop.

Our bottle shop was set up so only employees could go into the cool room and grab the drinks.

If you were being a cunt to me, whilst in the cool room I would shake the absolute fuck out of your drinks. I'd even open cases of beer, take out the 6 packs and shake the shit out of them. Proceed to sticky tape the case together, and "here you go sir".

The best was when the desperato regualrs would come in, grab a few longnecks/cans, and open them immediately, necking them while they sat in their car.

These guys are EASY to pick coming and ALWAYS order the same shit. If you'd been a cunt to me previously, and I was working a shift when I knew you were coming in at 5:00pm on the dot and ordering 3 cans of jim beam, I made sure those jimmy cans had been processed through my paint shaker hands 5 mins prior.

I miss seeing the panic of these guys when their drink explodes on them in the car. Kind of makes me want to get back into bar work..

TL;DR -  Revenge by shaking your drinks.

One day, switch your forks and knives. When your roommate/girlfriend/boyfriend/wife/husband is nearer to the kitchen than you are and occupied with something else, casually ask for a fork. Wait for them to return with a knife because they grabbed into the wrong drawer partition while on autopilot after years and years of training. Act confused and say "No, I asked for a fork!".

This basically negates any need for her job. If you ask a question, she treats you like an idiot, berates you, and then doesn't answer it. We're supposed to be able to write about lots of different types of artwork for the exam at the end of the year, but the tests we take are long lists of dates. There is no context for anything, and she's the only one who teaches the subject. She picks favorites, hard. There is a girl who sits at the front of the class who I found crying after school because she basically made her seem stupid because she wasn't aware of the names of the kings during the crusades. She considers herself an art historian because she teaches it. This is borderline retarded because I'm pretty sure my biology teacher isn't a fucking geneticist. She's also married to a very wealthy man so she has seen the majority of the artworks in person. This is the thing that really gets me. She complained that nobody had signed up for her two week long field trip through Europe, and attacked everyone who didn't sign up. Nobody wanted to go for obvious reasons, and lot of the kids in my class come from pretty low income families. When a guy told her he couldn't afford to go she went off on how it was only $4500. Her class puts me in a bad mood every time I enter the door. |-|

When we were alone our sexual chemistry was almost uncontrollable. I fell in love with you. Deep unforgettable love. We were one in the same. We got into a fight in front of our friends,  and your husband. All that went down that day was out of my hands, I walked out because it was so heated I couldn't take it anymore. I felt like the preverbial little boy pushing away his faithful pup so as not to hurt their feelings. You walked over to me crying, I was crying,  you hugged me and you said " I love you" I said I love you too, within a month you were separated,  shortly after I was aswell, but you started dating someone.  After that you shutout all of our mutual friends, I had no way to talk to you because you moved. Now your married again, I'm married again, I have no clue how to tell you I still love you. I'm aquaintences with your husband, you probably dont even know. Hell I'm probably not a blimp on your radar anymore. I wish I was. I love you. 

To my ex I hope you enjoy the life you made for yourself.   You were my best friend and I loved you. You split our family apart to be with your ex boyfriend.  And yes I knew about him from the minute he said hi to you. None the less, I hope you are happy, I am.  |-| 
|-| cnxu95m || 3 || My art instructor was teaching the class how to do a portrait from a live model.  I was already a working artist, but I was really young and took the beginning classes instead of testing out because I didn't have the confidence.

This bitch was super theatrical, and really arrogant.  She all year during her self masturbatory lectures repeatedly said "*I* am an artist, Thomas Kincaid is not."

People buy his work.  He makes it.  It may not be high society art, but it's art.

So she's teaching by example one day.  Pretty boring.  It's just pencils.  I start sketching the model, too.  I mean, we were all just sitting there.

She sees me, and encourages everyone else to start drawing like I was.  Cool.  She had been treating me like a teacher's pet the whole semester and it was weird, but yeah.  She has been telling me that I'm flying through the class, alright, whatever.  It made me feel uncomfortable, but she was being nice.

After we were all done the girl looked at all of our pieces including the teacher's right before my owns... and offered to buy mine on the spot.

The teacher changed that instant.  Before we started the next class she told me that she didn't know if I was going to pass the class, because I wasn't improving, I had just hit a plateau.  In front of all of the other students.

Normally I'm really passive, but she was mad because I got attention and she didn't, so she wanted to not only fail me, but make a spectacle of it.

Keep in mind, I was selling my work already.  I just wanted the degree.

The only thing I could think to say was "Okay, as long as the dean and [the head of the art department] agree with your decision there won't be a problem."

I was always hanging around the head of the art department's office before class, and I just *happened* to know her first name because my art locker was right next to her office.  I had never met the woman.  It was just an uncommon name.  Aeofa (pronounced Ee-fa).  I had a student with the same name.  It's Irish or something.

Yeah, I got an A.  *Sadly*, she doesn't work there anymore, but I checked rate my professor after that semester and surprise surprise!  She had like a zero rating because she failed students out of jealousy.  The ratings were all new, so I guess she didn't have tenure?  Idk what really happened, but I like to believe she wasn't hired back on.

I'm not special, or like super talented, she was just dramatic, and bitter as shit.  |-|

Ms. Mullery(also my english teacher) promptly took my story and i was sent to the office. My punishment was that i had a week of detention and i had to write the pledge over and over (because i told them about the dyslexia). After the week she tells me "now i hope you will honor your country instead of writing this tripe" as she shreads my story.

I've kept writing and will finnish my first book this year...i plan to "thank her" and send her a signed copy.  |-|

You were PERFECT and I'm so sorry that I couldn't be for you. I don't know if I ever REALLY was IN love with you but I know that I loved you in the only way I know how to love people. I sincerely hope that you found someone great because you deserve so much happiness. |-|

I was a huge nerd at the time, and took my grades far more seriously than any 7th grader should. Despite this, I never got any decent grades. In fact, no guys did,  she would immensely favour the girls. She even went so far as to point out to the 3 girls who were her favourite students, in front of the whole class. I've never even heard of a teacher playing favourites that obviously. 

I ran into her recently,  and told her I had juat been accepted into Law school. No shit, she laughed and said " ha, like the world needs more lawyers". She was still a petty bitch after 10 years. 

Her 3 precious favourites?  All three dropped out of high school,  1 to become a hairdresser and the others because they got pregnant and are now on welfare.  |-|

I couldn't connect in a meaningfulk way with anyone, for years and years.

Then, I did.

And its good. 

And we are married, and deeply in love.

But, now I am a middle aged woman, not the young 23 yr old I was when you died.

So, a different person. 

I loved you, but I love the man I married more. I cannot let him compete with a ghost.

You are dead, that almost killed me, but my husband is alive- so he wins.

I spent more than a decade mourning you, to no avail. 

Because of you, I will never have children, I miscarried when you died. I cannot go through that kind of loss, or even risk that kind of loss, ever again.

So, no kids for me. 

And thats a relief.  |-|

|-| cnxundd || 9 || Sometimes I think about my boyfriend coming up to me one day and telling me that it's over between us. It's not the worst thing that can happen to me, but it's certainly disturbing to think about. I play the entire conversation in my head:

"itriedeverything, we need to talk," *oh no, he wants to talk. Is he breaking up with me? Is he dying?*
"Okay!"
"I met someone else," *fuck me fuck me fuck me I fucking hate this what the fuck omg ducks.*

And then it immediately transitions to me crying and him telling me how special our times were and how I'll always be in his heart. Oh, and we'll be friends. Pfffft, please. Friends. 

I would be very upset to lose him, he's my best friend. I would hate it if he died before me. I wouldn't want to live in a world where he isn't present. 

Anyway, then I begin to think about the girl he leaves me for. I start to doubt myself and my appearance. I think about how ugly I am and how I need to starve myself to look fuckable.

My mind is a scary place.

|-| cnxv3vb || 4 || Oh man. This is worth writing just for those 5 people who will check the bottom of the comments. I had a really timid math teacher in highschool. She was nice and smart (had a PHd in Mathematics), but she just wasn't the right person for the job. Our school had a lot of troubled teens who needed to be kept in line and her classroom was always out of control.

One day she met with the rest of the faculty to get training in classroom management and in our next class we began with a lecture on etiquette. She put an image on the projector of a table with five columns. Each column had a number and a  list of expectations. 1 was a test taking environment. This means zero interaction with peers, total silence. 2 was for lectures. 3 was for group work. 4 was for socializing as you would expect in a cafeteria during lunch. And 5? You never want to go to 5. 

After explaining the table to us she came up with a brilliant idea. Lets model each one of the stages! We started with one. The classroom became mostly silent. Then she told us to try two, and then three, and then four. As she approached five I thought to myself, "Is she gonna go there?" She did.

"Now let's try a five!" The classroom erupted in piercing screams. I looked over to the teacher and she had her hands over her ears and her eyes were closed tight. People were running around the room yelling as loud as they could, flipping tables over, throwing chairs, dumping the trash all over the floor, running out of the classroom. Teachers from every surrounding classroom came barging into our class with a crowd of students following them. 

It still stands as one of the funniest moments of my life. She ended up getting fired after some time. |-|

He started giggling while I was presenting a book-report. I stopped and asked why he was laughing, and he asked, "Is that your mom's paper?" I stared blankly at him because in what world does a 5th-grader own stationery? I said yes and the rest of the class started laughing too. They were laughing because my paper was **yellow**. I didn't even notice until I compared my paper with the next girl's BRIGHT-ASS-BITCH-I-BLEACHED-THE-SHIT-OUT-OF-MY-EVER-FUCKING-TREES-TO-MAKE-THIS-PAPER. (5th grade memory might've exaggerated.. the girl was African American so maybe my eyes **really** took in the contrast.) Our family was poor and I felt so guilty when I made my mom buy new binder paper. She was arguing how wasteful this was because we still had 4 reams of the yellow ones. No one even commented when I started using my new white paper the next day. I felt like such a sell-out.

He had a World Language teacher in middle school. We'll call her Mrs. H.

Mrs. H was approaching her 60s, and God knows why she hadn't retired yet.

So my friend is sitting in class listening to Mrs. H lecture. As he's listening, he's twirling his pencil in between his fingers. Of course, he drops his pencil on the ground, and it makes an loud noise. Mrs. H looks over at my friend (we'll call him A) and says, "Go down to the principal's office!" And so he did.

A is sitting outside the principal's office, scared because he's never been sent down to the principal's office for anything. Eventually he gets called in by the AP, we'll call her Mrs. R.

**Mrs. R:** So what brings you to my office, A?

**A:** My teacher, Mrs. H, sent me down here for dropping my pencil on the ground.

**Mrs. R** *[face of disbelief]*: ...are you serious?

**A:** Yes ma'am.

**Mrs. R:** Just go back to class, A.

A walked back to class and as he walked in, Mrs. H says angrily, "What are you doing here? I didn't want you coming back in here!"

Eventually she was fired because of all the complaints the administration was getting from parents about her. AFAIK she works at another high school now, and every welcome article I've read mentions nothing about her job at the middle school. |-|

I missed out on American History in high school (sophomore year history class for the college prep classes, which were like the mid level classes) because of this guy.

It was nice in some sense.. At least 2/3 of the year was 'free days', which basically means 'hey I'm not going to teach today, so just talk amongst yourselves'. A huge portion of the remainder was movie days. Any movie involving American history. The patriot, American Gangster, Last of the Mohicans, Glory, Amistad, the 1980's Twelve Years a Slave (remember, 40 minute periods means each of these movies was the better part of a week, and these are just the ones I distinctly remember from this class, I'm sure there were more)... Good movies and all, but not a substitute for the class itself...

In the last month of the year before finals he basically tried to gloss over everything for the year. I know I flunked the final, but got like a B or something in the class....

He was basically the dream teacher for people that wanted to goof off, but in the end, he was just some fat loser who didn't do his job and did a huge disservice to everyone who had his classes. |-|

She'd had him two years earlier, and they *hated* each other, so he pushed her buttons like nuts.  Then she had me and decided to take her hatred of him out on me, even though I was an awesome English student.  It was normally my favorite subject, too, and she seemed determined to ruin that for me.

She'd cut me down every chance she got.  She'd give me D's on subjective papers when it was at least B material.  She'd grade me more critically than anyone else.  She'd call me untruthful.  

Oh, and she assumed that if your arms were crossed, you weren't listening.  Ever.  Nevermind it's always been a comfortable position for me to sit in, that it gave me some camouflage when kids were making fun of my early over-development, or that I repeatedly demonstrated I was listening.  Always.

I was her whipping bitch, and I couldn't do shit about it.

See, my mom was great, because she always knew that if I had a problem with a teacher, or if they had a problem with me, there was probably a second side, and she wanted to hear it.  She was good at finding the dividing line, and was usually pretty fair about how she handled it, too.  

There's only been two times I've ever seen my mom get pissed at a teacher in front of me, and one was Mrs. Poff.  I wish I could remember the details--I just remember her taking her to task in conference over an absurdly low grade she gave me (an F, if I recall), that was enough to drop my grade for the semester.  She did such a great job that I leaned back with my arms crossed, and then my mom--my nice, respectful mom--finished and did the same.

My mom is tiny and often didn't get where I was coming from, but that day, she was *fierce* and she nailed it.

I still had to suffer under Mrs. Poff the rest of the year, but she pulled back just a bit, and was forced to rescind the grade and give me a more... Objective one.

The only other time I remember my mom being that pissed was when my my Biology teacher accused me of cheating on a test that my mom had spent days helping me study my ass off for.  (We won that one, too.)

My mom is fucking awesome. |-|

I hope you find someone who can handle constantly being criticized and put down, because I know that's something I could never handle.

|-| cnxvg4z || 4 || I sometimes get this irrational fear that I'm going to swerve into oncoming traffic one day for no apparent reason.

Let me be clear: I in no way desire to do this, I don't have suicidal thoughts, I have never "lost control" of my actions, I never fantasise about it, but for some reason the irrational fear that I might do it occasionally pops up.

I figure I can't be the only person this happens to, though. |-| 
|-| cnxvgen || 42 || You told me I beautiful once. When you were very drunk, and we were already having sex. 

The way you talked about other women in front of me taught me to hate myself in a way not even my own mother's vocal self hatred and snippy remarks managed to do. You calling the fit, curvy gorgeous women in the porn I tried to share with you fat and disgusting and then sneaking out of bed to look at skeletal bodies on thinspo sites before coming back to fuck me was devastating. 

You still wouldn't break up with me or let me break up with you even though I knew I wan't your "type". I began to cry with disgust every time I had to take my clothes off to shower. My eating became disordered, when I wasn't at the gym I was too depressed to do anything but sleep, but never enough weight came off because I'm just not built like that. I'm from hearty peasant stock, tall and strong and with hips meant for hoisting big, healthy babies on while I sling a sack of potatoes over my shoulder. You showed me for the first time how to fear and resent the beauty of other women instead of appreciate it. 

You had no business dating a 19 year old (you were an adult, I was not) and then maintaining a life long grudge against me as the bitch that broke your heart by leaving you (because it was that or kill myself) that drove me away from all of the great relationships I built with your friends. 

I turned 30 and I bought myself a bikini and went to the beach. I stopped fearing that someone might see my arm flab jiggle if I wore a tank top. Or the thigh bulge if I wore shorts. What the fuck do I care? It only took ten years of struggle to climb out of self doubt and self loathing, of thinking I was disgusting or unworthy because I'm not thin or the right kind of pretty, of learning to appreciate being strong, being sturdy and capable and that those things have a beauty of their own, of partners and lovers praising every inch of me and them dearly wanting to punch you in the face because my insecurities hurt our relationships. 

I don't want them to punch you in the face. I know you're still a miserable asshole, well into your 40s and just moldering away on the same couch, in that same shitty, smoke filled studio apartment, being the same wretched drunk you were in your 20s, and still, shockingly, no waifish supermodels want to fuck you. I live in the city of my dreams, surrounded by amazing friends, living off my art, married to the best man I've ever known, who loves my wide hips, my thick thighs and my fat ass like there is no tomorrow, I'm 4 months pregnant with our first child and even though I'm bigger than I've been in years, even if I get stretchmarks that look like I was mauled by a badger, I'll never be afraid to be naked in the light again. That's enough for me. |-|

At a later class he was reading grades out loud and a student asked him not to. He threatened to fail him for being disrespectful, and that FERPA only applied if the professor agreed to it with each student individually.

Thank you for the push. I hope you're well.

|-| cnxvrex || 8 || Oh, ooh, *ooh*. I'm actually in the midst of a bullshitstorm with this loser right now. So, admittedly some of it is on me, I was failing Foods (Sounds impossible right? You don't have Mr. Fucking. Holman.) My guidance counselor, knowing I'm going through personal shit and all, convinced him to let me pass if I completed a packet. So I did. And when I turned it in that bloated shitstain (Did I mention this man, who gets uppity as fuck about nutrition and being healthy, is *shockingly* obese? Like I'm not even exaggerating when I say he is the fattest man I have ever seen. And up until this year the fucker was always carrying around bags of McDonald's and shoveling big macs down his throat at all hours of the day. He was like the Syd Barrett of junk food, except he is not a talented musician, just a scumbag racist (There's a fat black dude in my class who literally can do whatever he pleases. He once barged in, screamed 'I'm not going to school tomorrow!", took some cake out of the fridge and left, and on the way out Holman just laughed and said "Oh, don't get arrested, Dalonta (yeah, and it's pronounced "Dilontey")!". If either me, my lab partner or the guys on the other side of the room did that he'd have a fucking conniption. He goes haywire if we touch our hair while standing in the loosely-defined "kitchen area".))

Anyway, the fucker tells me I've gotta do this OTHER random worksheet he pulled out of his ass or he wouldn't count the packet (which earlier that day he had told me was due the week before, though I pointed out how the counselor had given it to me at the end of the week and said to turn it in when I got back, which shut him up) and by the end of class I was able to complete about a quarter or so of it, and I turned it in so I would get credit for the packet. "Oh, but you have to type your answers up and share it on google plus!" And on TOP of THAT he had the audacity to tell me that the lab my partner and I spent two bloody weeks on, he proceeds to tell me I NEVER FUCKING DID IT!!? YOU FUCKING CUNT I WATCHED YOU EAT THAT CAKE!!! This all happened at the end of what I call a "snowball day", where annoyances, disappointments and unprecedented bullshit (much like this is a perfect example of) builds up over a day until I'm about ready to reel the fuck off. AND BY GOD WAS I PUSHED WAY OVER THE EDGE. I made a goddamn fool of myself when I flew into a blind rage over it minutes after I got outside. I was already cursing to myself on the way out the door. I haven't had a psychotic fucking breakdown like that in years but by god I was NOT in a good state of mind that day, by a long shot.

*Puts out cigarette or checks watch or some ending-of-story shit* And that, everyone, is what makes Mr. Holman the worst teacher ever. |-|

I hope you're doing great, really. I've grown up a lot in these past couple years and part of me wishes you could see that, but I don't think that will ever happen. The woman in my life currently is amazing and I plan on marrying her. I hope you find that somebody too. |-|

This woman chose favorites. If you were two minutes late for class, she'd mark you absent. This was understandable. However, she would literally keep the attendance paper with her, refusing to give it in, when her favorite student was late. She was ten minutes late, and my teacher would say "No no. She'll be here. She's not late."

I once forgot my homework, and she said this, as loud as she could, in front of my class, "Wow WeirdoxPanda, not giving in homework? You've been the talk of all the teachers lately."

We were writing essays. She didn't even read my work, glanced at it, and exclaimed, "This is horrible. You think this is acceptable?" Grabbing my journal, she took it and showed my essay to my classmates, saying; "Look at this!" She proceeded to bash my work, which she hadn't even read.

She had my rewrite everything. Okay. Only for her to yell in class, "WeirdoxPanda! Front of the class, immediately! No talking!" (I wasn't.) A few of my friends defended me, only for her to claim she saw I was.

When I finished my essay. She claimed she couldn't accept it, as I had "missed the assignment completely, and didn't include paragraph three." I pointed to the paragraph, for her to blunty say "Oh." She then rolled her eyes and said, "Still it isn't good enough."

A few months later, we were working on essays again. I got an A+ on one of them, much to my surprise. She even came up to me and said "Wow good job. You're very capable of doing nice work." Later on, she claimed that a lot of people in my class did horrible on the essay, and it wouldn't count as a part of our grade. Checking with a lot of my friends, they all did extremely well on the essay as well.

I wouldn't have minded if I actually just slacked in her class, and she had a genuine reason to dislike me. But I wasn't. I was in honors class, and she just chose favorites, as my classmates also agreed about. She even talked about me to my other teachers, after one of them complimented me. She always talked about pronouncing words correctly, yet she had this thick Brooklyn accent. No one (except her favorite) liked her.

When I walk down to the hall and see a group of people going one way, I make sure they've seen me and then go the other way, walking slowly. As soon as I'm out of sight, I pick up the pace to almost jogging, then go back to a slow walk when I get to the other side. After a while, I noticed nearly everyone now went the way I kept going. 

Then, I did it on the other side, and got to listen to their confused voices behind me.  |-|

I thought of that time where we spent the morning together and later came back to my place in the afternoon and ended up falling asleep with you in my arms on top of the sheets. It was late spring and I had the window open next to the bed and the sunlight came in and woke me up before it got to you. I was barely awake and just looking at you and appreciating everything that you meant to me. I remember smelling your hair, and thinking "I could live in this moment forever." 

It's been almost a year now and it would be a lie to say I'm over it. I know I haven't tried to contact you since but I've wanted to every day. I feel like I've lost the most special person in my life, my lover, and my best friend. It's been really hard... really hard, but I understand it wasn't meant to be. 

I've never loved anyone as much as I loved you and I'm not sure I will ever feel that way about anyone again. I think there are some things you experience in life that just change you forever like that. 

Anyways, I want you to know that I have no regrets about it. If I could do it all over again, even knowing the outcome, I would do it in a heartbeat. Thank you for making me feel the way you did. You deserve the best in life, even if that means its without me. 

Maybe next time though. Maybe in another life. But for this one, I'll have to settle for those brief moments in time when I wake up but I'm not quite awake yet... and I'm still dreaming of you, holding on to feeling that you're still there with me and I'm on top of the sheets, smelling your hair on a warm spring day.  |-|

Presidents get the credit and blame for everything, but I know that they really touch very little that goes on during their terms. All that work is being done by the people under them. So, to me, the most important job of the President is to have a vision--a grand dream--for all those people below him. A vision to inspire American citizens, to give them something to work towards. And I have no idea what your vision is. I have no idea what any politicians vision is. What do you want me to do for my country? What do you want my neighbors to do? Where do you want us to be in 50 years? I've heard the abstractions--"hope", "independent", "free"--but those words don't inspire action. We need concretes. We need to be directed  towards action--specific actions. If I was President I would say: "America, I want us to develop renewable energy technology so humanity becomes self-sufficient and energy eventually becomes a right, not a privilege. America, I want us to *make things* again--cars, computers, chocolate bars, toys, anything--so Americans have jobs, and so we do not send so much money abroad. America, I want us to be on Mars by 2040. America, I want us to fix our bridges and our roads and our schools. America, I want us to strive for good health--from the food we eat, to the medicine we take--so we all can live long lives. And we will begin to do all these things while I am in office." Is my list of actions the best list? I don't know. Probably not. But it's at least *a list*, which is more than you or anyone else has given us. |-| 
|-| cnxwez9 || 7 || I didn't know you were unhappy. I knew things weren't ideal at all in many ways, but I thought that we both knew we at least had each other. I'm at fault for a lot of things, I can't deny that. I just wish I had known I was losing you so quickly. I still think of you. |-|

|-| cnxwhs4 || 6 || You made me the person I am today. I was so shy and quiet and very much an introvert and you brought me out of that shell. Made me more comfortable with myself and I could just be the dorky guy in public just like I am when I'm by myself. 

But, I am sorry that I slowly drifted away I never even knew it was getting worse until the very end. You kept warning me and warning me but I think that it was inevitable. Those last 3 months were hell for both of us. I met someone who actually made me happy in March and I knew I couldn't be with you soon after. I could never make you happy like you were in the beginning and you couldn't do the same for me.  I was a complete ass to you and I wish more than anything I could change the way our relationship ended. 

I am happy now though and I know you will find someone that will make you happy. You are a beautiful smart woman and anyone would be lucky to have you.

I lost a lot of respect for her and I think it ultimately poisoned our relationship because I felt like i couldn't trust her to not fuck whatever cool/exciting person came along.  |-|

Every time we see him and we are stopped i give him money because my son (who is 8 and has autism) thinks he is a pirate and loves him. once we were stopped at a stop sign and the man was hanging out by it and my son rolled him window down and said "ARRRGGG Pirate where's your parrot?" luckily he laughed and didnt think my kid was an asshole haha.  |-|

Yeah, you took everything- the baby books, the ultrasounds, the car, every penny- and left 3 months worth of unpaid bills, but you gave us our freedom. We don't have to be afraid of you anymore. We're safe. I'm struggling trying to pick up the pieces you left behind, pay down the bills, and parent 2 kids under 2 alone while your dodging being served for a divorce and child support.

|-| cnxx9xg || 15 || I miss you every single day still. It still hurts like it did that day. I might move on, but I'll never get over you completely. 
I'm sorry that I didn't let you go when I was supposed to. I'm sorry I dragged it out for way too long-I just know that if I didn't try, it would eat away at me forever. I'm sorry that now there isn't even a chance because of me, although every time I make a wish, you are what I hope for. 
I'm sorry that I pushed you into too many things you weren't ready for. I really hope that one day you will be, and we can be happy. I know this probably won't happen, but there was no way we could have been wrong for each other in the future. I just saw so many  wonderful things in my mind, and I'm sorry that I got carried away. 
I'm not sure what changed, or if anything really did, because I was very happy, and usually I can sense when things are heading south (as a very receptive person). I am just now learning how to accept the fact that I probably won't get a truthful reason from you as to why you decided that we should break up. It literally makes my stomach sick every single day. 

I can't drive anywhere without seeing a jeep. My heart fucking drops and I immediately start hoping that I'll get one last smile and wave from you. 
l would have done anything to keep you close to me. I would have waited any amount of time until you were ready. And it's important for you to understand that it is not considered a concession or lack of conviction on my part. What it is, is it's the way I show that I really loved you. That I was willing to compromise and allow for your own personal growth to take place, while also exercising the virtue of patience. 

With that being said, I'm very upset with you. You are a man of your word and your convictions, mostly. However, when YOU ask ME to be your girlfriend, when YOU are the first to say "I love you" (in that moment it seemed so genuine), when you take me to look at houses with you, when you make space in your closet for me, it really led me to believe that we were making progress, and that I allowed you to make your own choices, and that you wanted a future with me in some way (and I wasn't thinking it'd be an idealized version of what happens). And I don't believe I'm crazy for thinking as such, because I feel most women would agree with me on this. Shame on you for giving me no warning signs, shame on you for not voicing your concerns. You knew I was more than happy to talk about anything! And that, I, least of people, would not judge you. I may have a natural reaction to something you thought offended my pride, but you also knew that I was one not to beat grudges, either. 
I just want to let you know that I hurt. Mentally, emotionally, and even physically I hurt. Spiritually, it feels like I have some earthly magnetic force that is just drawn towards you. And it hurts because I have the overwhelming feeling that something is missing from my life, and that the farther away you are from me the more my life force takes a hit. 
And I know how you used to be in relationship(s). I saw all the posts on reddit that you thought you had deleted but didn't clear the comments so I see how you used to be. The letter that you had read aloud was too real and too a part of you to just vanish the second you moved to my state. I just wanted to know where that person is when I talk to you. Or how hurt are you from that disaster of a relationship really, if you have completely lost any affectionate or romantic bones in your body? Like, what really happened to you? And why didn't you feel comfortable enough to tell me? 
I want to say that I hope you're happy with what you're doing right now, but let's be real here. I hope you're not. I hope you're miserable and lonely, and I hope you cry sometimes when you miss me, all alone in your apartment. I hope you hurt as much as I do. But you would never admit it, in keeping with your tightly buttoned thoughts and emotions. 
Lastly, I just wanted to say that even though it's only Thursday, I love you. My whole being loves you, and will never stop loving you, even after death when all that's left is my teeth, my teeth (and nice gums) will have love for you. You are my most favorite person that I have yet to meet, and it sucks not to be best friends anymore.

|-| cnxxjns || 3 || Okay so a few years ago my girlfriend had some pretty shitty pair of roommates. Like, not bad in the sense that they didn't pick up after themselves or anything, but very catty and bitchy towards my girlfriend and the other roommate. It was disheartening especially since we liked one of them (Let's call her "Little K") who was easily manipulated by the other (Big K).

The year after that we were still living in the dorms and I had a genius idea. The two of them were still roommates but my girlfriend got new ones, and I realized that they would have to walk by my dorm every day to get to class and vice versa. So I started leaving subtle little messages on my chalkboard (we all had them on our doors) that were directed straight at them, but not enough so that they could have evidence that I was harassing them. [Here is a picture of one of them](http://imgur.com/41aR04s). The messages slowly turned nastier and nastier (I believe at one point I said "You have the most perfect face...for radio) over the months, and besides from "someone" smudging them they never made an issue.

Fast forward another year. Still in the dorms and hanging out with my roommate. This guy had been dating Big K and friends with Little K for about a year now and he knew about the whole issue and we'd talk about it. We were friends, and he didn't care really. I asked him if they had ever commented on the signs. He said that there was one day when apparently it started to really get to Little K and he and Big K had to spend a significant amount of time convincing her that the signs were not about her. After she calmed down, they decided to go for dinner and they walked past my door. The gods were on my side that day, because I had just changed the sign earlier to [this](http://imgur.com/mHNzJIb).

I finally thought about it in my teens and realized that she singled me out and loudly called out my mistakes, kept giving me disciplinary actions (oddly enough always *right* before the level where they contact parents) and always failed me in following directions because I would always try to skip ahead in work.

I talked with my mom about it after remembering this teacher and found out that she tried to get me put on Ritalin and a few other drugs, as well as attempted to transition me to the "Special learning conditions" classroom. She had apparently done this before, as the other teachers had warned my parents about her. The next year my teacher threw me into some enhanced learning and, big shocker, my grades skyrocketed and suddenly my disciplinary actions plummeted. Fuck you, Mrs. Pavy you bullying gremlin.  |-|

So even though they're saying it right, I'm acting like there's something subtly different about the way I said it, and just have them repeat it a few times, and since it's a loud social gathering they can't really tell whether I'm fucking with them or not.

Sometimes when the person seems really uncomfortable, I'll just leave the party. I know in the back of my mind that person will be thinking to themself, "Did I make him leave? Was that my fault?"

I don't even see the end result of my prank, just knowing I caused a little chaos is good enough for me. |-|

Back in my college days I was good friends with someone that was caught in one of their sting operations.  We drifted apart after we graduated though.   Well,  actually,  we drifted apart and then he dropped off the face of the planet.  I only found out about it in like 2013 when I was watching To Catch a Predator on Youtube.   It was really shocking because it was completely unexpected.  He had never indicated to me that he liked young girls,  hell,  I remember him being into cougars/MILFS.  I even fixed his laptop a few times for extra money,  and I never found any pictures of underaged girls.  In all the years I knew him he seemed completely normal,  he had a girlfriend that was his own age too.  His social life was pretty good,  definitely not an outcast.  I remember one Haloween,  me,  him and some other friends dressed up as [The Clash from their Rock the Casbah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ9r8LMU9bQ) music video.   Then he got really drunk and started to sing it,  even though he was dressed up as Paul Simonon ,  not Joe Strummer.  

  
He's probably out of prison now,  but I haven't bothered to re-establish contact.  I mean,  it would just be so bizarre,  the topic would be brought up eventually. .

First one is one that has done a lot of time, and is easy going, who we can trust to work in medical around the nurses with no issues. He has been up there off and on for ten years. It's a hassle trying to find any one else to help up there.


The second is really a group of people. If you have been to a higher security prison, gangs run a lot of things. My favorites are the higher ups who work with me to get things done. Sometimes is certain individuals I have to bring up to them to fix an issue, someone's they know the issue, and cure it beforei have to bring it up. They know if things get bad, lockdown is bad for us(short handed), and bad for their business. So is nice to have a common goal, although maybe for not common reasons.

|-| cnxysqf || 3 || That opinions cannot be wrong.

First off, an opinion is just a statement of personal belief. Thus 'the moon is made of cheese' is an opinion, though it refers to real world objects and can be disproven.

Second, when it comes to subjective perception your opinion can also be wrong. 'That movie is shit' can be a wrong opinion when applied to a good movie. Taxi Driver is a good movie. It is critically acclaimed and considered a classic. It has excellent cinematography, writing and acting. By all objective measures it is good, yet some people still think that just because they didn't enjoy it, that it isn't a good film.

These people have mistaken their colloquial statement 'that movie is shit' (which in fact and effect means "I didn't like that movie") for a statement that affects the objective quality of the movie.

Your subjective perception is accurate only for you, it does not alter real world qualities.

Also your opinion sucks. |-|

I went to overnight camp for seven weeks this past summer. Somewhere around week two, while he was outside, I went to my friend's laundry bag hanging from the corner of his bunk and tied it in a knot. It was small, simple, easy to undo, but he would notice it. I went to my bed and waited for him to come back inside. Sure enough, he walked up to his bunk, made a face at it, and quietly undid it.

A week or two later I did it again. Then again about four days after that. Then again two days after that. Then again. The next day, I tied three knots in his laundry bag. By now, I'm tying a knot every single day, and he barely finds it odd anymore.

Then I started to pick it up. I started doing it multiple times a day. He would untie it and walk away, and I'd tie it right away after. I started to tie other things. I tied a towel of his sitting outside on the clothesline. I tied his pillowcase and sheets. I tied his sleeping bag. Once, while he was asleep and five feet away, I tied every single one of his t-shirts, and returned to the pile over the course of the summer to re-tie any he'd worn since then. All while still tying the laundry bag.

At one point he went storming around. *"Who the FUCK is tying all my shit in KNOTS? If I EVER find out I SWEAR..."*

I still haven't told him. |-|

|-| cny01dg || 12 || Hey.

I know we haven’t seen each other, or even talked to each other, in a long time.But I’ve been doing a lot of thinking lately, probably more than I should have, and I want you to know that I miss you. Not like a “I regret what happened” or “I want to see you again”. Not even like a “maybe we should catch up sometime”. It’s just… I miss you. Full stop. Nothing further. It’s strange to think that someone I knew so well has become a total stranger. Someone I used to not go a day without talking to hasn’t heard from me in months, nor I from you. It’s strange to think that I can go entire days without thinking about you even a little. Most of the time I let myself forget because it is easier. But then I find something; an old letter, a little note tucked away in the sleeve of my binder, a coffee cup you teased me about because of how nerdy it was… and the full weight of what’s been lost comes crashing down on me.

But this isn’t regret. We had reasons for ending it, very good and valid reasons. But, back at the start, we didn’t need a reason for anything. It all just happened so effortlessly. We were miles apart with almost no hope for a future. But we didn’t need a reason to fall in love. We just did. The reasons came at the end, and everything since then has been about reasons. And that’s good. That means one day I might find someoneI won’t have to say goodbye to. Some day I might find someone, and we won’t ever need reasons for anything. We just will be. But part of me misses loving someone, and knowing that someone loves you back just as much. That’s all.

I guess what I’m saying is I hope things are good with you. I hope you are doing great. I hope you found a love that is all the things our love couldn’t be. And I hope I find that too, one day. But a small part of me hopes that you still remember what it was like before all of the reasons…. and that you miss me, too. |-|

Of course we had inmates that we could not stand as they couldn't manage to keep from masturbating in mine and other female officer's direction.

Last night, after a group of friends and I left a club at about 3am, we were passing by a closing McDonalds store and lying on the ground in front of the store was a homeless man. He had a sign saying he was hungry and would appreciate money for food, but only had what looked about maybe a dollar in many silver coins. I didn't have any cash in hand on me, since I spent it all in the club, but I had my credit card. Found an ATM, took out $20, and gave it to him.

You should've seen his his face light up. He got up, shook my hand, said he hoped I had a great night and that he was really thankful. Went straight into the McDonalds and bought himself some food, practically inhaled it he was so hungry, and then started to get ready to sleep.

He literally waited out the front of that McDonalds hoping for food, and the only one to help him was me. 

I understand how some people have a fear of being scammed, or people using it for drugs and other things, but last night, making that one man so happy was really worth it for me. And I always try to give them money if I can. |-|

|-| cny1ku3 || 24 || The radio joke, it always has been and always will be the funniest joke ever told. Here's how it goes.

Two elephants are in a bathtub. Two pink elephants. (At this point the teller will always begin to laugh because the joke is so dam funny) and the girl elephant asks the boy elephant to pass the radio. And the boy elephant looks at the girl elephant and says, RADIOOOO? and everybody breaks into hysterical laughter. 

Get it? Getit? No okay. I'll explain. 

You do it while in a large group of people. Part of the group can never have heard the joke. The other part must know it. The reason it is so funny is because the words used just aren't that funny. 

So anyways group A knows the joke, group B does not. So somebody in group A yells for somebody to tell the elephant joke. The joke is told and group A is snickering the whole time and then bursts into uproarious laughter at the "punchline" group B has no idea what the hell is going on, but wants to fit in so they begin to laugh, so for group A what began as fake laughter becomes real because all these folks are laughing at a joke that isn't a joke. Anyways, it's still funny to me.  |-|

|-| cny1mbt || 115 || I wasn't his friend, but I was friends with his son. Idk if that's still relevant enough. His son went to middle school with me and everyone in our whole community knew exactly what happened way before the episode actually aired. ( I've actually never seen the episode myself ). 

The guy (let's call him Ryan) was so embarrassed by what his dad did and was getting teased so relentlessly he stopped coming to school for a couple years and the re-emerged in ninth grade and by that time people were more mature and even though people would occasionally mention it nobody gave him too hard of a time about it.
He was dating a girl in my P.E class and she said he has no relationship with his dad at all and his family has considered changing their last name, which is kind of sad that they were that haunted by this situation.

Also, people have said that his mom tried to commit suicide but idk if that's true. Overall, from being a friend to someone in that situation I'd say that while it probably has lowered the amount of people booking up with kids, it also puts a huge burden of family members of these people when they are innocent. 

I mean yeah, Ryan turned out okay but he missed like all of middle school and can never get those experiences back and if it's true his mom tried to off herself I'm sure that's somethingg that weighed heavy on their family. It probably would have been way easier to cope if the whole world hasn't witnessed their tragedy. |-|

I've done this long enough not to expect honesty but I do appreciate humanity. If you're going to continue to be a dirtbag, okay then, give me a heads up on that shit and we will be fine. I would rather work with 30 guys that are showing minor improvements in their people skills while owning up to the fact that they are institutionalized and really don't think they're going to stay out of the pen rather than five guys lying to my face about how THIS time they are going to make it and end up failing a UA the next day. I've seen hard core murders break down and cry while talking to their grandmother for the first time in years and that goes a long way in helping me work with them the next time we meet and they call me a bitch.
Working in corrections, especially in the different areas (CO, counselor, case manager, probation, parole) is not for everyone. You have to either totally humanize the offenders or shut yourself off completely. Either way it takes a toll on you and it is never easy. Every day is an emotional rollercoaster when you open yourself up to caring, but no matter which route you go, cold or friendly, you are bound to connect with at least on inmate you work with (hopefully not TOO much, those investigations suck.) I have seen people taken into custody and then gone in my office and cried, other times I stood there and watched and did an internal happy dance. Either way I cared enough about them to have a reaction. |-|

|-| cny2d2n || 17 || I manage a network consisting of thousands of systems, some of which run in our clients office. These systems are not accessible to the client, they just serve a background purpose for certain important tasks. We have a call center that has to go into this system to fix certain things that affect other systems in the clients problem. 

Every time I do remote maintenance on a system I create a background with an icon. When the call center technicians log into the system to work on something they will see the usual icons on the desktop but also this one random on they can't select. It's always named to be something important or something they frequently use. I move the location of this icon on the background image every time I do maintenance on any of the systems. 

The amount of emails I get of people complaining about how there is this one icon that they can't select on the system is hilarious.  Some go through great lengths to try and delete it. Others just report it and expect me to fix it - which I always reply that there was nothing wrong and it worked fine for me. 

They don't have access to changing the background image or opening the desktop properties to see that it's just part of the background image. It's glorious.  |-|

Some backstory, I was hanging out with another of my best friends, and she had just switched from pads to tampons. So she had like 6 full boxes of pads she was gunna throw away, and this gave me an idea. I asked her for the boxes instead, she was a little off put by this. But then I explained what I was going to do with them and she was totally on board.

I'm over at my other best friends house, well call him T, quite a bit. And T is a massive stoner. Like, a quarter a day stoner. So this made it even better. Now everytime I visit him, I take one of the pads and put them somewhere in his room. After about a week of finding pads in his room he started blaming his 3 sisters, and they got into a huge argument. Even better.

I've been doing this for a little over a year now and am down to 3 or 4, he gets so fuckin pissed whenever he finds one of them now I'm considering going and buying more packs. It's absolutely hilarious. I even went an extra step with a couple and put some buffalo sauce mixed with bar b que to give it that really good old period blood look.

Alternatively the classic offer everything but repeat certain questions a few questions later works too. Or repeat the first and the last question.
Putting in a slight pause in every sentence is always fun.
Saying certain words slightly louder. Or just skipping actually saying the words and just mouth one or two in your conversation. Inserting superfluous words or overly describing irrelevant options.

As a 10 year veteran chairlift operator, if you piss me off enough, on a really slow day I might have to stop the chair for a good 30 seconds or so while you're hanging right in the middle of that dense snowmaking cloud from the deafeningly loud tower gun only about 20 feet away.  Since you usually can't see the top of the lift from the bottom and vice versa, people riding the lift have no real way of knowing who stopped it or why.  Because of this, you really can't go complain about me to the office and expect to be taken seriously. |-|

One of the guards felt bad for him I guess, because of how bad he was messed up. That kind of violence seldom happens I suppose?

|-| cny3lpv || 11 || I went to prison in 2011.  I made friends with a few CO's while I was in there. 

You can't be too openly friendly with them or is going to cause problems for you with the cop hating inmates that aren't smart enough to realize the CO's had nothing to do with their arrest or imprisonment. 

I regularly talked books with one of the morning CO's, he was actually a hugely condescending prick to the dorm, but we talked about our books after people went back to bed after breakfast. He brought me some books from another dorm after I told him I had read most of what we had and the rest were being held by people that take 3 months to finish one book. 

Another was named Kramer, he was the one all the other inmates dreaded. He was religious about the inmate handbook and followed it to the letter. He had a laugh at the amount of books I had sent in one time... Was about 15 books in one delivery. Him and I built a small amount of respect for eachother because I never violated any rules, and there was a time he accused me of breaking one, to which I cited the section of the rulebook. He had to admit the wording was loose enough to allow for whatever it was I did. 

Another CO was a chess player and eventually after watching me and another guy play for ~~days~~ weeks he got in on a game, he was a really cool guy that didn't fuss over stupid shit like drying socks on your bunk or melting things in the coffee pot. He actually let me have a fair amount of panda express one time. Which was amazing. 

Another CO I got along with started talking one day while we were stuck in holding for 8 hours for court. He told me about how a lot of the CO's are self righteous and look down on the people in here even though they regularly drove home drunk from the bar, which in Arizona is a bigger offense then what most of the people were in there for. I liked him immediately. 

Basically, if you're a normal, well mannered, semi-intelligent person that has the opportunity to actually talk with a CO, they are likely to be just as friendly as you might expect anybody to be out in the real world. There are definitely a few that are fucking scum bags and they probably got that way from letting the job get to them. I even had a co flat out lie one time to get me thrown out of a dorm I was comfortable in, when he was the one breaking the rules, not me. |-| 
|-| cny3mww || 10 || My biggest pleasure is swapping HDMIs. Doesn't matters whose house it is, friends, family, friends of friends. Once I'm alone in the room. I'll go up to their TV and change the inputs on their devices. I grab all the HDMIs cords in the back of their TV pull them out and plug them back in randomly. Next time I visit I'll do it again. 

One of my friends I go to their house about once a week. So every time I swap them. One day he got an Xbox One and wanted me to come over and game with him. I sit down on the couch and fire up his TV and ask; 'what input?' He said "I don't know man this TV is fucking weird. I've resorted to clicking around until it displays what I'm looking for. So just click input until we see something." That was the best day of my life ever!  

Also when I visit friends, I change the way the toilet paper roll is placed. If the put it on the holder with an under roll. I change it to the over the top and vise versa.

Theres this guy who sits opposite me who is a salesman and a bit of a tough talker. Think of a mix of Hank Schrader from Breaking Bad and Dwight Shrute from the Office, toned down a bit.

One day, after a great series of sales, he notices that whenever he makes a sale this 50 cent coin he has on his desk is standing on it's side (Australian 50c coins have 12 flat sides). Whenever he loses a sale the coin is sitting face down. This becomes his lucky coin and he is very protective of it - it must be standing on its side at all times.

For whatever reason I decide to subtly fuck with his coin. Everyday for about 3 weeks I get to work early and add another identical 50c coin to his desk, right next to his lucky coin - I get to about 15 coins all up. What made this funny for me is that he just had no way of dealing wit it.

This big tough guy would come in everyday and and see this small army of coins standing to attention on the side of his desk. He would stare at them perplexed for a few moments not knowing what to do. He wouldnt ever talk about it and just go to work awkwardly surrounded by coins. I don't know why but I found this really funny.

Eventually I got bored so started adding googly eyes to them and making them into little tableaus. Heres a small one I found on my phone. http://i.imgur.com/MClImoO.png |-|

You had the opportunity; the bully pulpit, momentum, and most importantly the mandate to fix so many critical problems. The people were [are] thirsty for solutions.  
And you squandered this opportunity. 
From prosecuting whistleblowers, to not closing Guantanamo, backing down on the public option, not letting tax cuts for the wealthy expire, pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, ruling out any prosecution/investigation of Bush-era war crimes, massively expanding the drone war and extrajudicial killings, looking weak on Syria and Ukraine, not addressing major problems with fraud and corruption in defense procurement...the point is, you have come to embody everything that is wrong and disappointing in my country's leadership.
You had a chance, and you failed, and continue to fail not simply because the Republicans are ignorant, obstructionist, racist, xenophobic, chickenhawk, homophobic, anti-intellectual religious zealots, but more because you alienated your true base by driving toward an illusionary middle of the road; this notional non-destination marked by goalposts that were ever being moved by the opposition, highlighting the ludicrous nature of this course. 
Remember that the real obstacle to progress is not the radical, but the moderate. The radical, left wing, European-flavored policies with which your political opposition likes to slander you, are the very substance of your success and support. Polls and political advisors be damned, we were ready for REAL change, and your failure to capitalize on that is unforgivable.

him: Yeah they're nice right?! She let me see them the other night after she got out of the shower. They look so hot, I swear when I jerked off yesterday I only lasted like 30 seconds.

me: no way you saw them? I would kill to see your moms tits.

him: yeah she's super chill about that kind of thing. Even, more the other night when we were sleeping I totally pretended to be tossing and turning and put my head on her chest and just slept there the whole night, It was awesome!

Then he grabbed a kid and threw him over a table and onto a chair when he wouldn't go to his seat. I'm guessing there was more, because there were plenty of rumors around him about gross, disgusting habits of his.

About a year later, he was terminated, and a few after that, got into a really bad car accident. Brought his mindset back to a kid's, basically. |-| 
|-| cny3xsr || 3 || My fourth grade teacher was a bully. She was 60+ years old, at the time I would have guessed 80+. You know, one of those old women whose faces is just a mash of creased skin and the way over saturated make up is there to tell you where her features are assumed to be.

Once our homework was to write down a metaphor. I used the dictionary to get an example and brought in: "All the world's a stage." I got an F back along with the big red words: "This is not a metaphor." Another time I was first in line at the door to leave and go to our next period and she yelled at me for leaning against the door. I hadn't, but that didn't stop her. She made me write 200 sentences, "I will not lean against doors.".

In Texas in the fourth grade there is a writing exam and she spent way too much time trying to prepare us for writing essays. I had been yelled at enough that I had developed severe anxiety and couldn't ever think of a first sentence. Everything sounded dumb to me and I was overly critical. She check in through out the period on how people were doing and when she realized three quarters of the period had gone by and I didn't have anything written down she started yelling at me. I broke down in tears and she told me crying wasn't allowed in her class and yelled some more. Any idiot could have seen that I was suffering from severe anxiety. I hadn't been playing or disturbing anyone else, I was just staring at my blank paper for over an hour straight leading up to this.

All of the teachers and administration admired her for consistently having the most well behaved classroom. And even as an 8 year old I would think, "Don't any of you fucking idiots have enough critical thinking skills to question why that is or whether it's a good thing?"

One day she accidentally got her foot caught in an open cardboard box as she was pulling away from her podium and nearly tripped. I had locked eyes with her from before it started until after it ended and my dead expression never changed. It spooked her and she said, "Laugh Jah_Ith_Ber". I really really wished she would die. She gave me my first homicidal thoughts. I dreamed about bringing scissors up to her, walking around her backside and just wailing on her until there was nothing left. An eight year old shouldn't have to have thoughts like that. |-|

|-| cny3zc2 || 5 || While I worked in a bar there was an old customer, Ivan, who came in semi regularly. He would just spend his gambling vouchers then chew the fat with me for a while. After several encounters, he came to tell me about his American pen pal &amp; how their unlikely friendship came to pass...

Ivan and his wife were one of these couples who were together forever. I never asked his age but he must've been 70 at least. One night, Ivan and Elise are watching a documentary. It's about the corruption, racism and injustice in the American justice system. The documentary focused on the life and misfortune Natalie Santa-Maria. A young biracial girl who at the tender age of 14 was at the wrong place at the wrong time. A child was murdered. Natalie was associated with the killer, but she had left their company some time before the offence was committed. Her and 4 other youths were arrested and charged with the murder of the other child. 

Natalie could not afford a lawyer and despite her provable innocence, the public defence attorney recommended that she plead guilty to a lesser charge. The judge handed down the maximum sentence possible. 25 years to life, for a 14 year old girl. 

Elise was profoundly moved by the documentary. As she and Ivan tucked themselves into bed that night she spoke of writing to Natalie in prison. She and Ivan slipped off to sleep that night, and come morning, only Ivan woke up. 

Ivan was shattered at the loss of his wife. He held on dearly to that last conversation, that of writing to a wretched girl in a far off prison. He wrote to Natalie and told her of the circumstances that brought her to his attention. They came to exchange letters. Ivan works towards hiring an attorney with the hope of getting a retrial, but with a guilty plea, there is little hope. Natalie writes of how she has educated herself while incarcerated. She is 26 now. Her entire adult life so far has been in jail. They exchange photos and Ivan is saving to take a second trip over to the states and visit with the woman who was in his wife's final thoughts. 

I've since left that job &amp; I don't see Ivan anymore. I often wonder how Natalie is doing. But to answer your question. Had I the ear of Barack Obama I would ask him if he received the petition for a presidential pardon from an old Australian on behalf of one of his must unfortunate citizens. 


And could he please look into it.

She also did a lot of touring.  She would fly me to some of the places where she had a show and then a couple of days off about once a month.  First class treatment all the way.  The sex was fun.  She kept me under wraps because she was afraid of rumors.  So when I went to see her I would basically stay away from her unless we were in our room.  We only communicated via email.  Even then it was just “Hey, I doing some shows in Vegas!”  I would look up her tour dates and if I was off work I would reply with something along the lines of “Sounds cool!”  Then in a day or two I would get flight and hotel information on my regular email and off I went.  I really liked her and looked forward to seeing her.  I hated not being able to talk to her or even text her.  It sort of withered away after about 6 months.

|-| cny4ijr || 32 || I work in telecom, so it's easy for me:

* Cell service means a nearby tower
* Towers in a low-traffic area with low impedence usually have a range of around 10 miles, 2 bars means I'm probably 7-8 miles away.

I send a coworker who's also a friend a text saying, "Stranded, dropping traffic".  I proceed to find the cell tower (which will be easy once it's night since they have lights on them), force my way inside the base station, and disconnect a couple network cables.

Within hours, a site tech will be on-site to investigate the problem and make repairs.  I'm found and get to go back to civilization. |-|

|-| cny4k9a || 42 || A couple of months ago I came upon a collection of what I could only describe as "a crates worth" of AOL free trials from the 90s

I've started leaving them everywhere. DVD Players, CD Players, Car Radios, Underneath couch cushions, inside wells, behind family portraits, books, as cupholders. All of these include inside my house, other people's houses, and stores.

If you ever go to disneyland and look inside any body of water and see a disc. Chances are that both I've been there, and it's AOL. "What's that shiny thing on top of space mountain's roof" you may be asking yourself. It's AOL.

Prison is more often than not, indirect supervision, where as the jail I work at is direct supervision.  I am by myself with around 130ish inmates.  There are so many controlling rules that if they were all followed, the "flow" of inmates into the SHU would be insane.  So I let the little things slide like trading food on trays or letting the inmates have prays services with each other.  They know that I let them do things like that, but they also know I will bust them if they try things like smoking, or gambling. 

It takes a while to get them to test your boundaries, but when it happens, most of them will respect you and not cause you many issues.  My Sgt. always tell me, "If you can get the majority to do what you say, and to respect you, then you're doing alright."  

The one who are my favorites are actually the "pod bosses."  Because they know I know that if something is going down like a fight, or tobacco, they are behind it.  If you can get them to respect you, then you can talk to them and get things settled down.  If there is tension in the pod, I'll go to the "bosses" and say that things need to cool off, or I am going to start "randomly" searching cells to see who I can send to the SHU.  It works 70% of the time.  |-|

|-| cny4r4o || 68 || Late to the party, but it's something I do all the time. 

When I first meet someone whose name I either overheard, or I'm introduced to them by name, I'll say "Oh hey, (their name... Let's say it's Bill), so good to see you again!" Usually I'll get a confused look and then a "You too!" And that's that. But every now and then, when they are like "Oh yeah. You too! Where did we meet again?" Or something like, "We've met?" It's on.

I'll launch into a long story using very common names and scenarios..."Yeah. Don't you remember that time we were at John's place for that big house party? You came in with that friend of yours or your girlfriend or whatever... who is the girl you were dating at the time? It was, maybe, two years ago..." They'll say, "Sarah?" "Yeah... Maybe. Yeah... I think it was Sarah!" 

At this point they've corroborated a detail, so they're hooked. "Anyway, I was there and you guys walked in right around the time John got way too drunk and he started talking about his ex... And you and Sarah were kind of freaking out so we all went out back to grab a beer and avoid the situation." 

At this point I'll pause briefly and say something to make sure they're on the same page... "You remember what I'm talking about?" "Yeah? Sort of." Then I'll confound with another variable... "I had much shorter hair then." "Yeah. Alright... Yeah... I think I know what you're talking about. John Smith's place, right?" "Exactly!"

Now they're starting to remember their actual memory, instead of my false one... So at this point, I stop telling the story to them and address the group so Bill has a minute to try and install my false memory into his real one.

"Anyway, Bill and Sarah and I went out back to grab a beer or smoke or something... Just to get away from John's terrible story... We haven't really met yet, but no one wants to hear John ramble... And Sarah is wearing this flowery dress... I'm wearing a plaid shirt... I remember, because I had just gotten it. Anyway we get back there and there's this old lawnmower just sitting there propped up on bricks... Like the tires had been stolen. I think they were probably just fixing it in reality, but it struck me as funny to see this thing like a car in the ghetto. And Sarah says something like, 'Does anyone have a watch?' So Bill says... What did you say again, Bill?"

Now Bill is very confused. He has one of two options... Make something up and keep the story going... Or say "I have no idea." What he chooses has little consequence, because I'll say something like, "Whatever it was... We all started busting out laughing."

Then I'll go on with some rambling details, very vague stuff that has happened to everyone at some point... Probably at a house party... Possibly with some dude named John, but I'll gradually start the descent into the surreal... 

"So we're laughing... And I'm a little drunk and probably a little high already, and I look over at Sarah's dress and I swear the flowers are dancing... So I say something about it... And Bill looks over and is like staring at her dress... And she looks down at her dress...  And we're all standing here out back, three strangers, staring at this girl's dress, and I'm about to say something, when there's this FLASH! and this shooting star goes by... Like... A big one. Lasted for a few seconds... And we all kind of dart our eyes to it and then... Then we just kind of stand there... Totally in awe... And Bill puts out his hand to me..."

And at this point I'll reach my hand out to Bill... Who 99 times out of a hundred is now standing there... Mind swirling... Jaw agape... Like he just re-witnessed this vapor of a moment. Hand now extended in pantomime of a phantom memory... And I'll take his hand in mine and hold it and say, "And he says 'Hi. I'm Bill. Nice to meet you.' And I said, 'Hi. I'm Justin. Nice to meet you.' And we just hold hands for what felt like a really long time." And I'll hold Bill's hand... Pause a bit... Draw it out...

Then still holding his hand I'll say, "And Sarah took my other hand..." 

And usually at this point I'll take someone else's hand who is listening. 

"...and she said, 'I'm Sarah.' And the three of us stood there locked in wonder at the universe... All connected and just blown away by this cosmic event... The tracers of this shooting star still painted on the night sky... The broken lawnmower on blocks... John reliving his past inside... Strangers just a few feet away... Sarah, Bill, and me... And I don't even remember who said it... Hell, I'm not even certain it was spoken aloud... But there was this feeling like everything was right in the world, and even though we'd just witnessed an explosion miles away, and we were made aware of how tiny we are as individuals, how vast everything was, there was this feeling like anything was possible together... And we were all a million miles tall... and I think... Yeah, actually, I think it was you, Bill, that said ------- 'I'll never forget this moment. This is what it feels like to be invincible.' And here we are now, years later... Together again. And you know what man? You were right."

Then I'll pull him in by his hand, which I haven't let go of, and hug him. Not the double back tap bro hug... But a hug like a man meeting his long lost brother would hug.

It's never exactly that same story, and sometimes I opt to throw in the "Nah, I'm just kidding. We've never met before." But the range of emotions that comes from everyone that got sucked into the fantasy is always delightful.

TL;DR: Often times, an elaborate fantasy is the quickest route to a new lifelong friend. |-| 
|-| cny4rnt || 36 || I'm a server, over half the people I wait on use credit cards for payment. 99% of the time (literally) their bill is a dollar amount and then some change, for instance $33.73. When they leave a tip about 25% of the time people won't leave an even dollar amount. Instead, they'll leave something like $6.27 which makes it a nice even amount of $47.00. This is a decent tip and I'll put it in as they wrote it. Assuming I know for sure my service was good, if they leave me something like $3.27, which is a shitty tip, I'll only claim 3.26 on the computer so that when they read there bank statement it will read $36.99. I dream of the day for a phone call of a pissed off OCD customer who wants his penny put back on the bill.

**Tl;DR If your an asshole I claim a penny less on your tip so that your bill doesn't come to an even amount.**

|-| cny4ss4 || 41 || When I was 16, I read Mineko Iwasaki's memoir. She was the top-bitch in the Geisha World (*Memoirs of a Geisha* was very, very loosely based on her life) for a hot minute and there was one part in the book that blew my mind and has since stuck with me forever:  
She talks about one evening, during her apprenticeship when she's out at some party and some older, bitchy geisha begins to insult her in front of the party, taking digs at her, laughing at her and, in general just horrible. At the climax of this event, the older geisha demands that Mineko, her subordinate, put her hand out and she drops a hot teapot (I think) in her palm, instructing her to hold it as long as possible.  
During this event, Mineko's palm is completely scalded, and she ends up dropping the teapot and leaving the tea house for home.  
The next morning, she puts some ointment on her hand, wraps it up, makes a fucking gift basket and goes to call on her "older sister" (the cruel geisha from the night before).  
Older Sister opens the door to see Mineko, prepared for a confrontation.  
"Oh, older sister. I just dropped by to thank you for your kindness and instruction last night. I was very delighted to see that such an established and experienced Geisha was there, and it's clear I still have much to learn. I very much appreciate your guidance and hope for the chance to work together again soon."  
Mineko smiles, bows, and walks back home, leaving Old Bitch with a horrified expression on her face. Allegedly, after this encounter the two never crossed paths again since Old Bitch would purposely switch her engagements and became terrified of this young up-and-comer.  
So, with that story in mind...  
I've had a coworker who I've been at odds with for a while. Some old lady who says rude things and tries to embarrass me at work. We had a very long, long fight one evening before x-mas and when I went home, I thought *I didn't handle that correctly*. Mineko's story came to mind and I resolved to be super, super, super nice to her from that day forward, thanking her for all her hard work (she does none), for her kindness (she's a bitch)  and for being helpful (she's useless).  
She now avoids me like the plague and I get to see her squirm under my supremacy, which delights me more than words can describe.  
**Tl;DR**: It takes a lot of mental conviction, but blatantly taking the high road and going out of your way to be kind and respectable to people who you hate / who hate you will drive them absolutely insane.  |-|

It's to make a liaison, it just flows better. So when you talk to someone, make all liaisons by using the wrong ending letter of the first word. Like "ils le son z'encore". 

It requires practice, but when you can do it subtly many people don't realize what you do and just progressively become disturbed by something they can't identify. Inspire from this sketch from "les nuls": http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xf6vpa_les-nuls-les-liaisons-dangereuses-h_fun |-|

Kevin thought that he was smart as fuck and he constantly bragged about his deadlift-qualitys etc pp. So yeah on sunday I wanted to go to university by bus (the faculty is up on a hill) and was waiting on the bus stop. Kevin was also there. We had some forced small-talk and the bus wouldn't come. Turns out we probably missed it. To come to the course in time we decided to go there by bike so we both ran home and got our bikes. So he thought... I ran home, remembered that a friends was going to the course by car, I phoned her, she picked me up and I was in class 5 minutes before the start. 1 minute before the class started Kevin busts into the room. Heavy breathing and sweating and says "the guy with the glasses [me] will be late, we missed the bus". I was just sitting relaxed in my chair, a coffee in my hand and said smugly "no I will not".

Dudebro - Man, this game is so gay. 

Me - Yes, this game is totally two men kissing. 

They usually go gross or something ignorant. 

Now if they keep using the word gay wrongly around me, I keep scalling it up to more descriptive sex acts. 

Me - That is totally two consenting adult muscular men doing butt stuff with their penises.

|-| cny50ez || 7 || Not me, but a girl I knew.

When One Direction first came to Australia, I was a fan. A couple of friends and I couldn't get tickets to the concert in Brisbane, but a girl I knew off tumblr thought she 'knew' what hotel the guys were staying in so we booked a room for the night and hoped.

Turns out it wasn't the right hotel, so later that night we decided to walk to the hotel and go looking for them. It was 2am. I was 17 so was another of my friends, the other was 18, the two girls from tumblr were 16 and my friends friend, lets call her "A", was like 21. 

We walked around the hotel, and couldn't see them, so we started to walk back to our hotel, but took the long way. The 16 year olds were so upset. Then all of a sudden, we see a guy walking around having a smoke, with two guys walking about 1 metre behind him.

It was Zayn Malik, from One Direction. We RAN over to him. The older girls and I were just yelling out can they please get a photo or a hug or to say hi.

They agreed. We all got photos with him. He bummed a smoke of one of my friends. The oldest girl was flirting with him, and he asked for her number. She gave it to him.

Later that night, at about 3am, she got a call from one of the bodyguards. They were sending a car over to get her and so she could hang out with him. They had sexy time. She said it was pretty good, and we were all relatively famous for a few weeks as the girls who were friends with "A" and who met Zayn at 2am and got photos/hugs/bummed smokes off etc. |-|

|-| cny5e4s || 22 || Not from the show, but one of my middle school teachers was arrested for child pornography on a school computer and sex with a minor (the age of whom was not released). The clues were obvious. He walked around the classroom with his hands furiously moving in his pockets. We all knew what he was doing, but no actions were taken against him. There were rumors that one student borrowed a pair of pants from him that had the pockets cut out. He went on to teach and coach for ten years after I was his student before he was finally caught. He had a wife, children, and his sister was my family's friend. When the news of his apprehension was released, the students and parents were so relieved to finally know he was out of the school system and in prison. 

A few years later, another female teacher from my high school went to jail for sex with a male student who was a minor. She had just obtained her teaching degree and had a child with her husband. I knew her as a substitute teacher and shared mutual friends with her family, but there were no signs leading up to this. The track records for the schools I attended are terribly ridden with sexual violence against minors, as well as providing drugs/alcohol to students.

When you're faced with a meeting with your supervisor, especially one where they feel like they're in a power position, take a notepad with you and take notes of EVERYTHING they say. Instantly ruins their power trip by making them question everything they say.

|-| cny5hwa || 3 || An old friend of mine worked as a CO for 9 years. He told me about a guy that was sent to prison for embezzlement or some other white collar crime. He was in his 40's, bespectacled, soft spoken, overweight accountant who wouldn't hurt a fly thrown into prison, minimum security but still, with real criminals. Anyway my friend knows this fella is in over his head and scared to death so he tries to look out for him as much as he can. They end up having a decent relationship making small talk about whatever makes the day go by faster. One time my friend even found out that this guy got his hands on some kind of shiv, but supposedly turned a blind eye because he was so sure he'd only ever use it to defend himself. |-|

TL;DR: In a document/post/message produced by myself, I would sometimes add a footnote or 'P.S.' or anything alone those lines at the end of it that would actually be longer than the main body.

|-| cny69xk || 6 || I travel a lot, and I happen to be Swedish. The best thing about being Swedish is that most people haven't met or talked to another Swede and they don't know a lot about Sweden either, this is the root of how I fuck with people.

Everyone knows Sweden is a "good" country where equality matters and we care about the environment. I use this to casually tell people when having pizza abroad that "Wow you guys still have round pizzas? We banned those in Sweden over 20 years ago"

I then explain we realized the square pizzaboxes left unused room in the corners which was considered wasteful and environmentally bad. so in Sweden pizza must be square so no room is wasted.

Let's see, what else is there...

I have a party trick where I can exhale smoke from nothing at all, i do not know how it works but it does.

The other day I was taking a train from Bournemouth to London to catch a plane back to Sweden (protip, don't go to Bournemouth in January). As the social butterfly I am I talked to some other people my age (19-23ish) and we sat down by a table in the train and talked.

At one point one of the girls complains her hands are cold, I tell her to put them in mine, which she does, and she says something like "Your hands are really warm!". It's just one of those things that run in the family, some people become bald, in my family we're oddly warm. Luckily for me this was the expected response, I quickly reply 

"Oh, you don't know Swedes are naturally the warmest people on Earth? It has to do with surviving in a cold climate".

They look at me not knowing what to believe and I add

"Sometimes it can lead to some weird side effects, I can show you if you want"

At this point they really don't look convinced, but they tell me to go on, before I do I ask to borrow the guys waterbottle for a sip of water.
He hands me the waterbottle and I have a sip, I then proceed to inhale and some 5 seconds later I breathe out smoke.

They were fucking blown away, not knowing what to think, I have another sip and say "It can really hurt your airways doing that" and as they ask me to show them again I tell them I can't because my lungs are still really hot and bothered.

This is how I convince people Swedes are so warm we turn water into smoke. |-|

She used to have pic of him for a wallpaper. Something like this http://www.desktoplounge.com/wp-content/uploads/wallpapers/Tablet/Andy-Garcia-Tablet-Wallpaper.jpg


So I downloaded the same jpeg, changed it just so slightly she wouldn't notice at first and replaced her wallpaper. I kept doing this for a week until he was smirking and winking at her. 

That's when she started to look over her shoulder every time she turned the PC on :)  |-|

|-| cny6kjg || 31 || I got a phonecall from a good friend of mine late at night and knew right away something was really wrong. She said that her fiancé had been arrested and while I was shocked, I assumed it was for some sort of minor drug possession or something. I'd never seen him do anything remotely illegal and we are are all pretty big nerds, so that was the only thing I could think of.

It turned out that he was actually arrested for soliciting a minor through Craigslist. I think he made contact and went to meet her, didn't actually get out of his car, but was arrested anyway. It was all set up by a local police department.

I was incredibly shocked. We are all in our thirties and while he was not someone I personally would have dated, I never had an inkling that there was anything off with him. I had just hung out with them the weekend before. It was horrible to watch my friend go through all the stages of dealing with it. She tried to support him as a friend for awhile because she was worried about his emotional state. I watched her go from minimizing his actions to distancing herself from him.

It was a long process and I'm sure still affects her to this day, because something like that makes you question your judgment about everything. You don't realize how much you rely on that until it's gone.

Even as someone more removed from the situation, I felt weirdly conflicted. This was a guy I had known and liked and I didn't want to turn on him, but he was willing to engage in, well, child abuse. It's really made me think about what it must be like for people who feel this way. My brain fucked me over with depression in the past, but I can't imagine dealing with the guilt and shame that many of these people must feel just for the thoughts they have.

On a very basic level, he's also a guy who was willing to cheat (?) on his fiancée and probably did in the past, so I don't want to sound super sympathetic here. It's just difficult to wrap my head around and I can't help but think that if we had more ways to help these people, it would be better for all of us. |-|

He actually grew up in my home town and was a student at that high school. He later grew up to teach there. He was part of community events, high school events. Like.... he wasnt just some teacher he seemed to love the community, the school, other teachers and students. 

I laughed it off at first, we used to make gay jokes about him. He was like Kevin Kline in "In &amp; Out" so it was hard not to. I wasnt able to talk to teachers about it when it happened, I had graduated years ago. There were no clues. I mean, he was a nice guy like many teachers, he was single. No rumors of him looking at the girls. I had teachers in my time known to be perverts. Maybe his complete aversion to young girls was a sign. That he kept his distance so much was because he was interested.  |-|

We got there pre-dawn, they put him in costume, make-up, we sat around in a trailer. He read the paper, we watched TV, he studied his lines. I was bored out of my freaking mind. I got to meet my stars (OMG!) we had lunch. Finally, he shot his scenes at about 3:30 and we left at about 5.

|-| co0dm4q || 51 || I work in a pretty successful retro video game store and it's amazing. I see and learn new things every day about something I'm passionate about. I see awesome and rare things like Nintendo's Virtual Boy, R.O.B and Power Glove, up to rare 3DS consoles that came out. I see awesome custom work that people do to their systems and we even take collectibles like transformers, figurines, power ranger memorabilia, hero clix, and even Skylanders and Amiibos. We also have Magic the Gathering tournaments every week, a lounge in the back to play your games, a disc resurfacer in case you scratch up your games and we do repairs on consoles. I get to converse with awesome people every day who share the same passion that I do, met my girlfriend who won our most recent Smash Bros tournament and taught me how to be good at the game. I made best friends and am pretty happy being there. 

Sounds awesome right? There's a downside. I have to frequently deal with close minded fan-boys who love to shit on everything they don't like, PC master racists who have no business coming to my store, kids who sit on YouTube all day and come in asking for "the worst game on the NES." People automatically assume I know everything about every video game ever made and if I don't they get mad at me. Mom's who hate video games assume I'm a loser and don't want their kids talking about their passions. We have well over 100,000 discs in the store and sometimes organization can be very difficult.  Worst of all though is that EVERYONE wants my job and they don't realize that it's not GameStop. You have to know what your talking about or you lose money. 

Even so, I love my job and I'm good at it. 

TL;DR retro game stores are awesome but you have to deal with a lot of shitty people who don't know what they're talking about.

I work at one, and it's fucking great. My responsibilities - ring people up, count the money, restock drinks, clean four coffee pots, and mop the floor (only when I need to). Other extremely minor, 2 minute jobs like counting newspapers. Not counting customers,  I literally do four hours of "work" every week and get paid for 30, at a bit more than minimun wage.

Work at a convenience store. The biggest downfalls - My bosses suck (but I only see them for a few minutes a week) and I'm not paid great. As much as I'd like to make more money elsewhere, the job's so nice that I'd hate to leave. |-|

National Park Ranger- you get to live and work in amazingly beautiful locations, and you spend most of your time working outside!

Yes, it is beautiful. Yes, it is fun. However, be prepared to only work 6 months of the year, with the possibility of picking up a shitty 3-month temp job in the winter to make ends meet. Also, you'll only spend an hour or so outside every day. More than most places, sure. Most of your time will be on visitor center desk duty. You'll be living in park housing, which means you could be living with awesome folks or shitheads looking for an easy ride. From my experience you have a 75% chance of getting someone decent.

You have to have a good sense of humor to work the front desk. You'll hear the same 4-5 questions all day long, and people will challenge the answers you give them whenever they can. 

It is a fun job. I miss it at times. I loved the scenery and, yes, even the visitors. But I enjoy the fact that my current work has a bit more diversity to it now and that I can buy new things once in a while without obsessively checking my bank account. |-|

Reality: Half the companies offering the lunch make you go to a "lunch and learn". So you don't have that extra hour to yourself, you're still doing training basically while getting a free lunch.

As for the free breakfasts and dinners. They usually schedule these in such a way that you're either coming in earlier than you normally would, or that you're staying later like free breakfast until 9:30, or free dinner at 6pm. I know that Google actually has it setup so that their shuttle bus times going home line up so that you can't get free dinner and still be out of there not too late.

As far as the free snacks go, you are pretty much tired of them within a year. |-|

At least at my place, great company discount on parts and whatnot, like, a little over cost. 

Downside is if you scratch one of those you're life is going to suck. Also a lot of those supercars are terrible vehicles. They're hard to get into and out of, they're finicky, they don't want to start if they have been sitting a while, they don't want to start if you literally just had it running five minutes agoseriouslywhatthefuckiswrongwithyouyoustupidsaleenpieceofcrap, nothing says 'paranoid driving' like being in a car worth more than you will make in the next 10 years on a road filled with people driving cars they have a $100 a month lease on and are driving like rental cars.

|-| co0r8c3 || 3 || I used to think being a PA to someone famous would be totally amazing....travel, free stuff (taking care of unwanted gifts), meeting famous people, getting paid loads, and having a glimpse of glamourous life in the shadows.

I worked hard, got well skilled, highly recommended by previous employers, and landed that dream job.

12 months in, I had many at 'glamourous version' of what I did, my friends and family were envious and proud of me.  The truth of this job was:  long hours, no social life, exhaustion (emotionally from the effort to make the impossible possible with high and sometimes ridiculous demands, physically from the lack of sleep and worry), and the 'costs' of working... My cleaner, babysitter, dry cleaning and general incidentals.... I needed a PA of my own is how it felt.

In saying this, I loved it, it was a challenging job and the rewards were guilt free as I earned them, well and truly.  

And, the best part was simply the candid moments.  Moments when a celebrity is just a normal, insecure dude who's chatting about normal everyday stuff, or confiding in you, or asking you if you have something they can take 'for perculation' (diarreah) because they get nervous, and that sort of thing.  They were all awesome, nice, often insecure, but amazingly talented people. |-|

If anyone's wondering about concert photography, I've been running a small side business doing precisely that, coupled with graphic design, and it is brutal to be taken seriously. You work on your portfolio for YEARS before people say, "Hey, you're good, can you shoot X or Y for me?" and then shaking them down for money, because they think they don't need to pay you. Because "you need exposure". People die of exposure. I'm female and generally, the booking agents, promoters, managers, and sometimes the artists are twice my age. It's been an uphill battle. 

And managing artists/musicians? LORD. Friends of mine are musicians. Once in a while, I end up running backstage, or while I'm with my people, I see how it is done. I am also good friends with staff at several major events, and trust me when I say all the rigmarole and stereotypes apply in one way or another, and this is regardless of genre. 

If not for the fact that I love my photo work and the people I get to work with, I would not touch the music industry.  |-|

I have multiple "backup" alarms, in the rare event that I accidentally hit snooze on the first one. these each have different alarms. they panic me if I snoozed through the first and prompt me to jump up. alternatively, if I got up in time, they serve as reminders.

first alarm is 5:30. I take time to veg out, daydream, and cuddle my wife and kid. this way I enjoy a little bit of "me time", so I don't make excuses later. first "real" alarm goes off at 6am. I should be out of the shower and dressed by 6:30. I should have the dog walked, sandwich made, and ready to head out the door by 6:45. This gets me to work usually by 7, but in the rare event I keep sleeping in gets me to work by our team's 7:55 morning huddle.

|-| co10a7j || 610 || I think I actually saw this on reddit years ago, but I don't see it here now.

This requires setup for a few days, but once it works, you're good so long as you don't run it. First, get a new alarm sound. Doesn't matter what it is, just something you don't wake up to now. Next, set your alarm to go off in one minute. Now, get into bed, covers up, eyes closed as if you were asleep. *As soon* as that alarm goes off, throw off the covers, get out of bed, and go do *something*. Doesn't matter what do long as it's something that takes a minute or two. Do push ups, brush your teeth, feed the dog, whatever. When you finish that thing, kill the alarm. Then reset it for another minute out and repeat the whole process five to ten times. Do this every night before bed for a week.

What you're doing is giving yourself Pavlovian training for how to react to that sound. When you hear it in the morning you'll be up and out of bed literally before your conscious.

Here's the kicker though. You can only have that alarm go off when you actually want to get up. Don't set it for an hour before you need to be up and then snooze. Don't get back into bed for five more minutes after you've done your thing. Pick a different alarm for weekends. If you hear that alarm and don't get up, you'll weaken the conditioning.

Most people don't realize that they do this to themselves already. We just do it in a way that makes it hard to get out of bed in the morning. We hit snooze 5 times, or look at our phones for half an hour, or click on the TV and then roll over for a while. If you instead condition yourself to pop out of bed at that sound, and then reinforce that conditioning every morning, you'll never have trouble getting up ever again. |-|

I can't actually wake up early. I'll always sleep in, no matter what the consequences. Last semester, especially around finals, I started to go to sleep deep into the early morning, and never wake up before noon. At the very end of the semester I pulled a few all-nighters, and ate breakfast and turned in my final papers before going to sleep at around 11:00 A.M.


Since I didn't have much to do between semesters, I repeated the pattern, and even took it further, since that's what I was used to by this point. I'd wake up usually when it was already dark outside, and say goodnight to my family as they ate breakfast. 


I continued sleeping in later and later, first to four P.M., then five, until I was waking up at midnight. My schedule got so out of control that I began waking up sometimes at two or three in the morning. 


Most people would have recognized the problem by this point, but instead, I continued my descent into nocturnality. I slept in so late one day that I woke up a bit before the sunrise, at five or six in the morning.


Ever since then, people have been wondering how I wake up early. But the truth is that I'm actually sleeping in, by about 24 hours. |-|

The thread is too long and not many people will see this but I commented anyway because this method works so damn well for me |-| 
|-| co0ss02 || 908 || I go to the gym at 4 am 4 days a week. It's a bitch. 

I sleep in my sports bra. Seriously,  some mornings the idea of getting it on is too much and enough for me to reset the alarm until 5:30. But then if I'm in the bra, I'm not going to take it off... and sleeping until 5:30 means I have to wake up and strip it off, walk past my unused gym clothes... it's like a sad little walk of shame. 

I feel better going and doing it. Working out late isn't an option so I'm going to miss a work out. When I get home from the gym I drink my protein and surf reddit until it's time to shower.

It's all about what I'm going to miss out on for the day. It's "my" time. I try to remind myself it can be spent either sleeping or working out. But I'll be prouder of the working out.  |-| 
|-| co0vo03 || 2355 || I enjoy having breakfast in bed. I like waking up to the smell of bacon. Sue me. And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself. So most nights before I go to bed I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill. Then I go to sleep. When I wake up, I plug in the grill. I go back to sleep again. Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon. It is delicious. It's good for me. It's the perfect way to start the day. Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot. That's it. I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.

**|O___/\,**

(Headboard ---&gt; Feet)

In this position it's mostly impossible to fall back asleep for some reason. Give-or-take 5 or 10 minutes of listening to the radio and I'm ready to get up.  I usually relax for an additional 10-15 minutes and gently stimulate my clitoris.  It feels really nice in the morning for some reason.  I can climax quite often this way and at that point I usually remember that I am currently unemployed and I don't have to wake up anyways.

|-| co0w9fu || 154 || I pay a vagrant child to junkpunch me if I hit the snooze more than once. After two or three of those I'm usually bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and ready to rassle.

Edit: for those of you worried about how I can afford several crotchshots a day, I pay him on commission: he gets a percentage of my earnings that day based on the following equation: 0.4% * (my daily income * how effective the punch was). 

The punch's effectiveness is based off of a logarithmic table where I spin a twister board where each color is given a number. Little Turbinado (named thus because he is a real sweetie) is colorblind, so the equation pretty much solves itself once you understand that they all equal one. Sorry Turbinado, papa's gotta eat!

Once that is all figured out, I run it up the ladder, have my accountant doublecheck that shit, then give the kid two options: either take the dough, or bet it all on a game of chance that involves a one-minute timer, a video camera, and lil Turby bobbing for apples in a party-sized chip bowl of cold urine that I try to add to daily. If he picks the apple-bobbin', the money is guaranteed  to return to my pocket seeing as the kid has no teeth. Do I feel bad? Hell naw, that's Vegas, baby! |-| 
|-| co0ta0h || 32 || I try my hardest to stay on the same schedule. When I start straying to wild 3am nights and boozy hangovers I get totally derailed.

But if during the week I'm getting up between 6-7AM, on the weekends I make sure I'm up and at 'em by 8 at the latest. Sleeping in leads to staying up later and staying up later makes it harder to get out of bed.

Consistency is key!! |-|

|-| co0r6ec || 103 || Make a habit of going to bed early. It's sounds easy and boring at the same time, but it works. If you have a hard time waking up in the morning, it's because your body is still tired and wants sleep. If you know that you have to wake up in the morning, go to bed early the night before--even if you don't feel tired. Eventually, your body will adapt and you will find yourself with a new sleep pattern. |-| 
|-| co0zbka || 32 || I set five different alarms for different times. 6:10. 6:20. 6:30. 6:40. 6:50.

And then he smashes me in the face with a pillow and asks me to get the fuck out of bed so he can go back to sleep.

Yep. |-| 
|-| co0z8so || 14 || I used to have a cat that would take the cue, right when my alarm rang, to hop onto my bed and incessantly demand that I pet her. If I stopped petting her, she'd punch my nose, except for really cold days when she was perfectly fine sleeping in. 

So I'd set my alarm for half an hour before I needed to get up, and spend a half hour waking up while petting my cat, who loved every second of it. 

She died, so I don't have any tricks anymore.  |-|

|-| co113se || 4 || When I was in school and I had an important test in the morning, I'd fall asleep with the lights on with a shirt over my eyes and my alarm clock across the room. With the lights off, I'm sometimes able to groggily go across the room, turn my alarm off, and go back to sleep. But my groggy self is not yet smart enough to deal with the lights being on, so it forces me to wake up.

Nowadays, I just use Alarm Clock Xtreme on Android, which forces me to do math problems to prove that I'm awake. Sometimes, for extra redundancy, I'll use my laptop as an alarm clock as well. On Mac, you can type this line of bash into the terminal to set an alarm for 6 hours (21600 seconds):

    sleep 21600 &amp;&amp; while [ 1 ] ; do say wake up ; done |-| 
|-| co11eeu || 4 || I would say I'm a night person, but my job is flexible with my work hours. Essentially, the earlier I start, the earlier I can finish. And having most of the afternoon off is personally satisfying. 

I wake up at 5:00am every day, and I'm out the door by 5:20am, which includes having a shower and general bathroom hygiene. Some pretty basic tips here:

* Have everything ready the night before. Your outfit pressed and ready, your bag packed, lunch already made, etc. 

* Really understand your body and how much sleep you need to feel great. For me, anywhere between 8-9 hours of sleep is perfect. So I go to bed around 8:30pm usually.

* Understand that when you wake up feeling extremely tired, your brain is probably in the middle of a REM cycle. For a proper night's sleep, your body will go through two cycles, but if you wake up between the first and second (usually about 4-5 hours sleep), you can generally go through the day not feeling tired.

* Cut out stimulants from the early afternoon. No caffeine and limit sugar intake. Replacing drinks with plain ol' water helps. 

* Don't go to bed hungry. You won't sleep well with stomach pains. Have a good solid meal a few hours before bedtime.

* Good bedding! It's surprising how many people sleep uncomfortably. Find a nice, supportive mattress and good pillow type for your sleeping needs.

* The more activity - mental and physical - you get into a day, the easier you'll fall asleep in the evening due to exhaustion. Exercise, reading and mind problems help, as does a proactive, stimulating work environment.

* Stick to the routine. The first day or two is going to be rough, but bear it out. Once you have a routine down, it becomes very easy to get up early.

If you don't know the song, look it up. It starts out with a whispered "let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the --" ... then three hits of a high hat (tish-tish-tish), then the singer screams "FLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOR!"

The first few times, I slept until the FLOOOOOOOOOR part, by which part the volume was a full blast. It would scare the shit out of me, and I'd jump through the ceiling, then scramble to kill the music before it exploded my brain.

Eventually, I'd subconsciously hear the whispering in the beginning, then would jump out of bed to kill the sound at the high hats, before the screaming started.

|-| co12iqb || 3 || Don't set an alarm. Look at the clock before you go to sleep, make a note of the time, think about it and think about how many hours it'll be til you wake up, and about when you're going to wake up. Go to sleep thinking about the time.

You'll wake up naturally, meaning your alarm won't screw up your mornings with a jolt of adrenaline (or any other hormone). And your brain will make sure to gracefully end whatever phase of sleep it's doing by the time you need to wake up.

It may not be for everyone, but it sure works for me. I don't understand coffee or alarm clocks. |-|

|-| co0wijb || 3 || Don't set your alarm earlier than you would honestly wake up. Hitting snooze 5 times is just stupid.  |-| 
|-| co12ei1 || 3 || Probably too late to the thread, but ***I have actual advice***, so here goes:

* Go to bed the same way. And only use your bed for sex and sleeping. Don't watch TV or sit on your phone or play video games from your bed if you can help it, and if you do, get up and wash your face/brush your teeth/use the restroom in general after using electronics before turning off the night and going to bed. The key here is to set up a routine that you follow roughly 5 minutes before going to bed. Do it every night for a week and even if you have a hard time falling asleep initially, after a week it will pay off. 

* When you get up. DO NOT SNOOZE. This is imperative. You don't actually gain anything when you snooze. You're tricking your brain into thinking you're getting sleep. You aren't. Deep sleep is all that's valuable, so snoozing is just a waste of time. Get up.

* Once your alarm goes off, don't lay in bed and get on your phone. Don't sit down and use electronics or anything. Get up, and go turn on a light / open blinds. Simulate a sunrise if you don't have one. This will force your body to be like, okay damnit time to start my day. 

* Try to avoid caffeine to wake up. Go cold turkey for a week, and then use caffeine sparingly. The long term dividends far outweigh your laziness. 

* When you wake up, do something within 15 minutes of getting up to get your heart rate up. Do jumping jacks until you fall over, do as many pushups as you can, etc. Simple exercises, 5 minutes or so. Then shower or whatever. Not enough to really work up a sweat. Just do it for a week and make a habit of it. 

If you read these things and thought you don't want to do it or can't do it for one reason or another, you're wrong. You can do it, it's pretty fucking easy. And if you don't want to, the feeling of never being tired in the morning - and I mean never - is amazing. Everyone around you is like a zombie and you're kicking ass. 

tl;dr set a routine, use bed for only sleeping/sex, don't use electronics while in bed, don't snooze |-|

|-| co08bjx || 2734 || Give a stranger a sincere compliment. I've told a housekeeper at a hotel I was staying at that I appreciated how hard she worked and gave her a $3 tip. She broke down in tears and gave me the hardest hug of my life. We've all got the ability to make or break someone's day- let's use it for good!

Edit: I seem to have not made myself clear in what I was trying to convey. I simply wanted to give an example of how verbally acknowledging someone can mean so much. Obviously a shitty $3 tip wasn't nearly enough, but it was all I had at the time. My point was that if I had only given her $3 she probably would have been like, "oh, well that's nice." However, I actually told her that I recognized and valued her hard work which I imagine is what meant the most to her. Telling someone something nice can mean the world to them, especially when it comes unexpectedly.  |-|

Edit 2: Thanks for the gold! 
 |-| 
|-| co07qav || 877 || Understand that people are allowed opinions and opinions do not neccessarily mean "I am right and this is fact." Stop asking me for sources and citations when I express a personal opinion.  

Edit: seems a few people aren't getting my point exactly.  

I'm not saying I won't change an opinion when I'm faced with a lot of facts that say otherwise (no idea where that has come from).  

I'm saying redditors take it too far with even the most trivial opinions. For example: "I have my steak medium-rare because I get more flavour from it than if it's well-done, so medium-rare steak is better!"  

"Source and evidence that medium-rare is better? Here's some evidence stating that well-done steak is better."  

What are you trying to achieve here? That's not going to alter my taste buds and make me think well-done steak is better. I'll always like it medium-rare. Even more annoying replies are "Medium-rare is better? Well that's just your opinion." Well done, Captain Obvious.   

Stupid example, but I hope you see my point.  

Now, if I have the opinion that ADHD isn't real, and someone links me a lot of scientific facts and evidence that it is real, it's just overly-diagnosed, then yes, obviously I will change my mind and think "Okay, ADHD is real then, thanks for showing me."  

There's a difference between a personal opinion and an opinion represented as fact. My issue is with redditors who always think it's the latter. |-|

|-| co08w8x || 30 || Keep several cases of bottled water on hand, a few oil lamps and oil, at least a weeks worth of non perishable food, an envelope of emergency cash, and dont wait til your gas tank is on E before you fill up.  Most of the comments I saw were for this site but this is just common sense for life.  If your ever in a natural disaster situation having enough water, food, and light sources could keep you out of trouble until relief efforts can get things straight.  Having the cash on hand and a full tank of gas could keep you from being stranded if you have to evacuate quickly.

|-| co0982a || 66 || Stop downvoting because you disagree. According to Reddiquette, you should only downvote if a comment doesn't add to the conversation.

Downvoting because you disagree discourages people from offering unpopular opinions because they'll be buried, and sometimes unpopular opinions are crucial to conversation. |-|

|-| co0amsv || 39 || **Don’t waste your life wishing other people harm**

I never had to deal with bullying in school but I had friends who did.  And I remember them telling themselves, “You just wait until I’m the boss in 20 years and you’re flipping burgers”.

I saw the same guys in engineering classes talking about women, “Sure she sleeps around now.  You just wait until she’s 30 and nobody wants to date her”.

Let me explain something: **life is not fair and there’s no such thing as karma**. 

That girl that you know banged 3 guys at that party? She’s going to get her wedding, with $30,000 flowers at the ripe age of 30 to a virgin that she has sex with twice a year.

He’s going to laugh because, “in the end he got the girl”.

She can cheat on him, divorce him, then make him pay child support.  There won’t be any consequences for her.

That girl in your Computer Science class? She’s going to get guys falling over themselves to do her work for her and a fast track career at a major tech company.

So let it go. Accept that she got lucky by being born as a women in the first world.  Accept that you got lucky being born as a man in the first world. We do not choose who we are born as.

You could be a starving African child who’s never drunk clean water.

You could be a child soldier.

You could've been born in North Korea.

You could’ve been Princess Diana’s eldest son.

**Appreciate the fact that despite this being an unfair world, you got a pretty good deal**. Appreciate that we have no control over our birthright, but control over our lives.

There are people above, and people below. Realize that this is not just between men and women, but those of all social classes, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and every other metric you can think up.

The sooner you accept some people have it much better for much less work, the sooner you will decide to improve instead of complain.

*If you see yourself as a victim, you’ve lost.*

Outrage will not help. Anger only makes you seem bitter to others. And nothing is a bigger turnoff than bitterness. |-|

When people start crying and scrambling to shake off one or a few downvotes they've noticed they've gotten, and even delete their post, it's just nuts. Whole conversations about the points themselves, and then conversations about the conversations about points. It's a colossal waste of time and doesn't deserve all that energy. And a given community's reaction to the exact same thing can be so variable. Sometimes it gets a bunch of downvotes and people pile on, sometimes it just gathers dust, and sometimes it happens to hit an artery and get voted way up. And you never know why somebody voted or in most cases who voted, and none of your whining or crying will make any difference other than to make you crabby and sad. Just let go and have conversations. Focus on the words, not the points. Your life will be better. It really, seriously, seriously doesn't matter.  |-|

DOWNVOTING IS NOT A FUCKING DISAGREEMENT BUTTON. Downvoting is for posts that are not relevant. Jokes sometimes can get a pass, but if someone is arguing don't be a prick and downvote every comment by one redditor, and upvote all the others. It is a huge bias especially when the downvoted person is adding to conversation and may in fact be right but preceived wrong due to the upvote/downvote ratio. |-|

Many accounts on reddit are not just a guy or a girl posting on reddit for fun.

|-| co0elzd || 5 || Have a little intellectual humility. I don't care if you're liberal, conservative, libertarian or fascist, none of us are omniscient and the only way we approach anything resembling truth is by recognizing that we might be wrong and hearing other people out. |-|

|-| co0cmx1 || 12 || Stop being a judgmental asshole about overweight people (disclaimer - I am skeletal myself, but that's because I have an eating disorder).  Try to be empathetic.  Nobody *wants* to be overweight, ridiculed and undesired.  And it's quite possible that even the most vehement fat acceptance evangelists are motivated by internal shame.  Weight is a much more complex issue than the standard reddit catchall of "calories in/calories out".  We hardly know anything about how weight is related to the microbiome.  And even if that were a non-issue there are still a multitude of other factors such as environment, income, upbringing, education, appetite levels, willpower, self-control, self-esteem, depression, despair etc. that all play a part in weight.  I love reddit, but it saddens me when I see so many judgmental "calories in/calories out" posts - human bodies occur in an infinite variety of appearances, and blaming and shaming people for their weight is as logical as blaming and shaming people for their height or their facial attractiveness.  I kind of expect a better level of rationalisism from redditors.   |-|

|-| co0almj || 5 || Ask real questions about things. We are all so quick to jump on band wagons and pick sides. 

When Eric Garner got killed we never asked why there were tanks in the streets, why two FBI agents got shot and killed but no news organization picked it up and ran with it, why a small ass town captivated the world, why that boy lay on the ground for 4 hours before they got his dead body, why the video showing him "robbing" the store had the date of June 6th on it? (may not be the exact date but it was not the day he got shot. It was months off)

When Bill Cosby was being accused of rape did you know that Netflix had to pay him ~$70 million, and I can't remember the network that ran his show but they had to give him ~$60 million? He was also getting ready to buy NBC. They can't be trying to get money cause the statue of limitations has long since run out. They couldn't get a black man arrested for rape back in the 60s and 70s? Really?

Ask real questions. Take race out and ask real questions. We know America is racist and misogynistic but damn, don't let that cloud your critical thinking skills. We know justice system is biased. We know that after all these years we are still fighting against bad voter laws that our parents and grand parents had to fight against. Now that you know it's the same fight they had, you realize that someone is playing a game with your lives. You can now ask real questions. |-|

|-| co0cqie || 2964 || My first job - at the age of 16 - was as a paper runner at a local print factory.  My responsibilities essentially entailed walking up and down a huge row of printers to check that everything was running smoothly and to refill the paper stacks as and when required. I did my job faithfully, but would often hide in the discarded cardboard stack and read the newspaper. 

The lady who dealt with my induction was a sweet old dear called Gladys - she was the mother of the factory owner, as well as actually being retired, but she spent most of her days doing administrative work, picking up the odd phone call, and making pots of tea for the staff. Gladys was 85, and basically an older, wrinklier version of Hyacinth Bucket. Everytime I saw her, in her cute little floral-print dresses, I just wanted to hug the shit out of her. She was lovely. 

In my second week at the factory, a full-on brawl broke out between four people (two were twin brothers) because a cheese and pickle sandwich had gone missing from the fridge. Punches were thrown, printers were overturned and one of the ladies from the administration office who tried to intervene was called a cunt. The fight only stopped when Gladys launched a kettle at one of the twins - it was one of those old, hefty AGA kettles made of anodised steel. It knocked the twin out cold, and Gladys promptly turned on her heel and returned to her office. I recall everyone being in awe of the fact that this sweet old lady, the one who'd mothered some of the older members of staff since youth, had the temerity to wage battle with a kettle.  

P.S. I never admitted that I was the one who actually ate the sandwich and the guilt lives with me to this very day.  |-|

I think someone heard about *the Terminator* and played Telephone with it, is the only explanation I've got.  |-|

|-| co0vacu || 148 || Teaching in a small Ugandan village, my students asked me if hot dogs were actually made of dog.

|-| co0mdzv || 2582 || I'm an American in Europe who TAs, and most things are from movies- super unsafe, callous people, everyone has a gun, women sleep with anything that moves, etc. 

When I ask, say, a German if I should then base my opinions on how THEY are shown in movies, I get a look of horror followed by one of understanding my point. |-| 
|-| co0txko || 113 || When I was teaching English in Japan, I had a 15 year old girl ask me if I saw everything in blue because my eyes are blue.  I almost laughed, but she was dead serious and everyone else looked at me expectantly while waiting for the answer.

Not a specifically American stereotype, but similarly indicative of an insulated culture.

Which actually reminds me, I also had an ethnically Japanese co-worker who had grown up in Las Vegas (but who also spoke Japanese).  His students often refused to believe he was American.  They thought it was some elaborate ruse. |-| 
|-| co0qggp || 511 || I taught English in China for a while back when I was in highschool. They thought all white guys could surf, shoot a gun, and walked around without a shirt. All white girls had huge boobs and were very stupid. All black people were drug users.  |-| 
|-| co0r9h1 || 505 || I taught high school English in France. Some sample questions from students:

* "How many donuts do you eat per week?"
* "How many celebrities have you met?" (They were under the impression that celebrities were just walking around all over the place... And around every corner... In a country of 300+ million)
* "How many guns do you own?"
* "Do you really only drink from red cups at parties?"
* "Does everyone drive a big car, like a Hummer?"
* "How many times a day do you eat McDonald's?"
* "Why does everyone in America go to church?"
* "How many gangs are there in your city?"
 |-| 
|-| co0v1wt || 222 || I'm super late to this party, but I taught English in France for a year. One day one of the kids made a comment about seeing me out running over the weekend. The kid sitting next to him goes, "how did you see her if she lives in America?" the teacher was like WAIT, WHAT... turns out this one kid thought I flew home to the US every day. 

This was a 4th grader. |-| 
|-| co0q8dc || 820 || Besides being asked if Americans shower with their shoes on in order to keep them clean enough to wear in the house, I've had to keep a straight face when a barely 5-foot skinny Japanese girl asked me if she seriously had a chance to be a big black rapper's ho upon graduation if she went to college in the US.

Other noteworthy ones were an adult student whose mind was blown when I told her that we have sewing needles (she thought they were a Japanese-only thing) and a kindergarten teacher who didn't know that cat's cradle string games were known outside of Japan. |-| 
|-| co0sihv || 107 || I was teaching in the public schools in Shanghai. My students didn't believe me when I told them I was American because A) I was not huge, B) I didn't bring a cheese sandwich with me for lunch, and C) I don't own any guns. |-| 
|-| co0nbak || 681 || I'm in a small town in northern Italy, and my students are baffled by the fact that I don't go to church. |-| 
|-| co0mtzd || 558 || Not just an American thing, but one of my teachers was in the Peace Corps back in the day and went to the Philippines. She said that all the kids thought that snow grew on trees because the only snow they'd ever seen was in pictures.    |-| 
|-| co0t174 || 84 || I was presenting at an exhibition in Shanghai of about 95% Chinese people, and a young woman came up asked me where I was from. I am white with brown hair and eyes. When I said I was American, she looked baffled and responded, "But don't all Americans have blue eyes?"

A lot of people also think all Americans are fat and tall. It is a bit more understandable when the person is old. An old man in a Shanghai park asked where I was from and when I said the US, he hollered "Then how are you so short???" (I'm just over 5'2) |-| 
|-| co0sqzt || 74 || At my high school I was the immigrant mediator who would teach newly arrived Russian and Ukrainian immigrants (and sometimes Jamaican and Haitian immigrants) English and assimilate them into American society. This was in southern Brooklyn, where there were thousands of Russian immigrants coming in during the early 2000s every year. I was picked for the Russians mostly because I was from Chechnya and knew Russian. 

The biggest thing they would ask is how do they start with dealing drugs, joining gangs, and where is the nearest gun store. They came from places with atrocious crime, and often they were criminals, and they probably heard about Americas drug and gang problems and thought they could make a better living doing that in America. They had watched movies like the Godfather or even stuff like Menace II society and thought America was this badass outlaw land, when in reality their countries were a ton worse. 

Many of them came during the 2000s during the early Putin era when crime was dropping fast and it became harder to be a criminal in Russia. But many were shocked that NYC was not the crime filled nation it was back in the 1980s and 1990s.  |-| 
|-| co0v905 || 58 || My mother lived abroad in Europe and thougt the movie Grease was literally just another day for Americans. 100% serious, she thought we all drove muscle cars, and danced and sang in the hallways (of course not in sync, THAT would be ridiculous). She was a bit disappointed finding out we weren't all that musical.

Edit: This is my favorite thread ever. |-| 
|-| co0mmp3 || 775 || I taught English in South America and was asked if it's true that all foreign exchange students from America and Europe got one of those year long birth control shots before they came over, just in case they were raped.

|-| co0qwn4 || 271 || When I was teaching English in Spain I was very earnestly asked if Notre Dame was a school or a minor league sports team. |-| 
|-| co0oxkl || 383 || My brother teaches English in Japan, one of the other teachers once said "thanks Obama".  That teacher was Japanese. |-| 
|-| co0roas || 100 || English teacher in Japan here. I was once asked by an elementary school boy if there are police officers in America. Yes, I said. He then asked if I'd ever been arrested by one. I think my answer disappointed him. |-| 
|-| co0xc8f || 95 || Late but here it goes:

I work in what we would consider an inner city school in Bangkok, Thailand. These kids got kicked out of public school for behavioral issues so now they are at my school. Naturally, these kids aren't the best academically. They are 17 or 18 years old but have the English ability of a preschool- kindergarten level. So when they ask me questions they tend to mime every thing out. The two most common questions I get are,

"Teacher! *mimics hitting a bong* smoke weed every day?" 

Then the other most popular one is the boys will come up to me, put their fists about chest high bringing it down to their hips while thrusting their pelvis forward.
"Teacher! Boom boom many lady?!" 
The best part is they look at me wide eyed filled with excitement like I'm going to respond 
"Yes I smoke blunts the size of beer cans and then bang hookers."  |-| 
|-| co0su9j || 142 || Ethiopian children didn't believe I was American because I'm not blond |-| 
|-| co0titx || 51 || Not a teacher but I had a friend in Germany while I took German. We exchanged papers and edited them for each other for our foreign language class. Apparently her English teacher said that all American schools started at 9 in the morning. I lived in a rural area at the time where we started at 7:30. It took her a while to believe me. |-| 
|-| co0luv8 || 581 || I'm Canadian, and my ESL students keep thinking I'm American. |-| 
|-| co0r9lo || 416 || I am not a teacher however my brother is over in Germany. He told me that he went to a skate park and got thirsty so walked to the snack bar area to get a water. 

My brother:" Hey could I get a water please."

Snack guy: hands him the water " No here its free "

My brother: " I appreciate that but I would like to pay"

Snack guy: "No its free, see im not a Nazi"

My brother: " Oh no no I wasn't implying that you were "

Long story short apparently some German people think we think that they are all Nazi's still.

|-| co0th7p || 1180 || Teacher in Japan here. Man, where to start?

1) All Americans are fat (tried to convince them this wasn't true, to no avail), and everyone is Christian (squashed that pretty quick)

2) We only eat hamburgers

3) All Americans keep their shoes on in their homes (only half true. Lots of gasps when I explained this), and all homes are huge mansions (they were surprised to see pictures of my one-story ranch-style home).

4) Everyone carries a gun - related, America is very dangerous and you could get killed walking down the street (again, only half true)

5) We don't work as hard as Japanese people 

6) Cowboys still exist. Edit: So, cowboys still exist? Now I have learned something today lol. I guess I was talking about Native American-killing, saloon-entering, dueling cowboys, and not so much the kind we have today. But I stand corrected, they exist!

7) Everyone is beautiful (contradicts number 1, but this is based on the Hollywood image)

Teaching is fun. They were surprised to learn how many dairy products we eat on a daily basis (I'm from Wisconsin and showed them pictures of a lot of cheese, ice cream, etc...). I probably accidentally reinforced their beliefs when I showed them a hamburger, fries, and ice cream meal that was around 2000 calories...They've also been very surprised that...

8) We don't take baths every night (we shower) and we don't have any public hot springs. Edit: As it's been pointed out a few times, we DO have hot springs in America. However, they are few and far between when compared to Japan. Also, Japanese hot springs work in such a way that you walk in, shower and bathe in front of a mirror in front of others, rinse off, and go completely naked into the hot water. I'm not sure about American hot springs, but I would find it hard to believe that this was also the case in the West. Many old people and children and everyone in between love hot springs, and they are usually (in very rare cases, not) separated by gender.

9) We don't often eat fish or rice, and when we eat fish it's usually fresh water (for those not near an ocean)

10) We own many cars (every member of my family has one to get to work), with wide yards, wide roads and driveways, often have garages, and basements. I explained we need basements in the Midwest in case of tornadoes but also for storage.

11) The size of our refrigerators is ridiculously big to them, as are our Christmas trees, our food and drink sizes.

12) People decorate their houses with lights for Christmas (in Japan, mainly shops, companies, and parks etc are where you can see "illumination."

13) They are always surprised to hear how much it costs to see a doctor and pay for medicine. In Japan, they have national healthcare. I'm covered by it and when I have to see a doctor and get medicine it costs in total around 35 dollars. The only exception is the morning after pill, which costs closer to 300 dollars (versus about 40 in the US). However, over the counter meds in Japan SUCK. They're weak and expensive and have no effect on me whatsoever.

There's more, but on account of I don't think many people are going to see this, I'll stop here for now.

Edit: Woah, people care! I've posted more [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2tna3x/american_teachers_abroad_what_is_the_craziest/co0v0ne). You can also [check out my blog](http://haleyraeinjapan.blogspot.jp/) if you want. I haven't updated so much recently, I'm trying my best to do better on that, but I've lived in Japan for almost three total years so I've seen and done a lot. Enjoy. :)

Edit SOME MOAR!! - Answering your comments has made me remember a few more things. Like...

--Japanese people really don't drink that much milk. Many of my students detest the stuff. It makes me weep milky tears. Also, cheese. Not many kinds in Japan and definitely not great quality overall, unless you go to a special shop where you can buy more expensive kinds of imported cheese. All kids, however, agree that ice cream is the bomb.

--In place of this, many Japanese people drink lots of cold and hot teas instead. I rarely see a Japanese person drinking water, even when working out. This always baffles me, even three years later.

--I don't know if it's because my students are young, but many of them think that America is older than it is. This is probably because Japan has a history that goes thousands of years back, while the America we know today is still fairly young, less than 300 years old. 

--There's a present culture (omiyage) in Japan where if you travel somewhere you're expected to bring gifts back to your coworkers and friends (I brought back a bunch of Reese's peanut butter cups for my teachers, lots of comments about how sweet and salty they were compared to Japanese chocolate). Very fun but gets very expensive. I once went to Disneyland in Tokyo with a friend and she was being really stingy with her money all day, until it was night and we were about to leave, and she bought about a million omiyage for her family and friends. A very sweet gesture from a girl who really didn't have that much money to spend.

--On Japanese work ethics: Their contract will say 8:15 to 4:45, for example. But they will often work extra hours without extra pay. This will be because teachers (or public office workers, or salary men, or whomever), have to come in early to prepare their work for the day, and stay late to impress the boss. Some people fall asleep at their desks and aren't chastised because it's a sign they were working very hard. Teachers are also coaches of clubs and often work weekends and go to practices after class. On top of grading and writing tests and lessons. They are very, very busy and I do my best to support my English teachers all that I can.

--In Japan, there's something called PuriKura, which comes from the words "Print Club," or a photography club in Japan. It's a fancified photo booth where you take a bunch of pictures and can personalize them and edit them to look just as you want them to. Many of them automatically widen your eyes and brighten the colors. Here's an example [on my blog.](http://haleyraeinjapan.blogspot.jp/2012/05/life-has-been-busy.html)

--Also, Japanese teachers and business men etc do not often have tattoos or piercings. Especially teachers. They do not have dyed hair or painted fingernails or anything of the like. This is because if it's not allowed for the students, it's not allowed for the teachers. They are also not allowed to have long hair unless it is pulled back in a ponytail. (I'm an exception with long hair and a tragus and forward-helix piercing. My kids like to ask about them but my teachers generally ignore them.)

--The anti-tattoo culture is so strong that I've even heard it said you might not get a job if you have a tattoo. And since health checks are mandatory every year in Japan, doctors may make a note if they find a tattoo on your body even where you can hide it. Your employers and potential employers can see this and make a decision based off of such information.

|-| co0qnlv || 288 || I work in the middle east and get a lot of casual N word dropping I think because students hear it in gangster movies and pop culture and think it's just common place. They have no idea that it's even slightly taboo.I tried to argue one day and a student pointed out that Snoop Dogg said it about someone else, so why can't he. Says something about our culture,I guess. |-|

- I was not fat or stupid (Germany)
- I could speak Spanish (Spain and Chile)

|-| co0rhnm || 155 || Canadian in Japan. When I worked at a junior high school, one of my coworkers thought all North Americans just don't eat fish. Or rice. Ever. At all. He was shocked when I told him I ate fish and rice all the time as a kid. I'm pretty sure he thought it was just an Asian thing.  |-|

"Where are you from?"

"But you're not fat?" |-| 
|-| co0pni1 || 382 || My mother taught in Australia from 1979 to 1986.  Her students found the way she pronounced things strange at times, but other than that nothing weird.  The students just accepted she was American like a lot of the people they saw on TV.  

She said the adults were worse.  My mother is African-American, so she had to deal with racists.  My uncle called her a "negro" until my father told him to stop.  She also dealt with some guy on the street who called her a "bloody negro" when he bumped her car with his car.  My father was with her and instructed her on how to insult him, so she pokes her head out of the car window and calls the guy a "fucking wog".  Having an African-American woman yell that at him caught him off guard, so he shut up and drove away.

Also, a lot of the Australians my mother interacted with found her natural hair very, very interesting. |-| 
|-| co0r27h || 204 || I taught in rural Japan for three years, after a long line of westerners, including mostly Americans. They thought the usual stuff: all Americans own guns, Americans eat cake for Christmas (like Japanese), Americans eat hamburgers every single day, America doesn't have 4 seasons (because only Japan had four seasons, apparently), Americans cannot learn Japanese (I spoke almost fluently while I was there and could read and write), etc. |-|

|-| co0spmx || 107 || I wasn't teaching, but while traveling I was asked by some schoolkids from London to confirm that it's illegal to talk in elevators in the States, especially New York City. |-| 
|-| co0u0bx || 30 || "You're American?! But you aren't white!" |-| 
|-| co0v0gb || 32 || English Teacher in Thailand. Pretty much what you'd expect, though I think it's more of a stereotype than legitimate beliefs -  Surprised not everyone is rich, all people own a gun, we love hamburgers, etc. (but so do they!) One legit one is that when I told them I had an oven in my home back in America. Home ovens are virtually unheard of in Asia, so they thought it was amazing I could bake bread every day. Like I would ever bother to do that. |-| 
|-| co0np02 || 673 || I taught in Mexico for a brief period of time. Here were a few of the odd misconceptions:

* My students couldn't believe that I grew up without a maid and that I had to work through high school and college
* They thought that even the poorest people lived in nice houses and owned laptops, smart phones, nice cars. etc. They didn't seem to believe that food insecurity and extreme poverty existed in the U.S.
* Thanks to Hollywood's racist portrayal of black Americans, my students seemed to share the idea that most black Americans were "gun toting thugs". Some of them even said they would "run the other way if they saw a black person walking down the street". None of them had ever seen or met a black person in their life; I did my best to convey that this was in no way true. 

Another weird thing was that my Mexican roommates would yell at me if I walked around our apartment barefoot. They told me that I would "catch a cold" by walking around without socks or shoes on. Apparently my American friends were also told this by their host families/roommates. 

EDIT: a word |-| 
|-| co0sq29 || 33 || While working in South Korea, one kid assumed I ate hamburgers everyday. I was like, "No, there's lots of different kinds of foods...like past and pizza." |-| 
|-| co0uo6x || 32 || Kind of cheating since this was a teacher, but I think it's too good not to share. You be the judge.


Was teaching in a Japanese elementary school a few years ago. This particular day I was covering a very international-themed lesson with my 6th grade classes and covered some simple topics on China, the US, France, and other countries. Just as I began to finish up the last class before lunch, the homeroom teacher walks over to me, and this conversation occurs in Japanese just loud enough for our impressionable students to hear.

*Homeroom Teacher: So, about Obama... he is... not American, right?*

*isitatomic: Uhhhhhh.... well no, he is certainly American... he's the president of America after all.*

*Homeroom Teacher: Right, right. But, he is Asian ("Asia-kei").*

*isitatomic: ........*


The bell rings as I stand there dumbfounded. This teacher had to be 40 or 50 years old, and I didn't even want to think about what other nonsense she had been teaching kids about the world for decades. 


Tried to explain Obama's ethnicity, nationality, and parentage to her and a few nearby kids as quickly as I could before the dash to lunch. Only partially succeeded and she gave me one of those quizzical "Ahhh, hmmm...." responses.




**TL;DR    Ethnonationalism + whatever my former Japanese colleague was smoking = Asian non-American Obama.**

Co-teacher, "You have guns in America, right?"  
Me, "Yes"  
Co-teacher, "They're to protect you from the black people, right?"  
Me, "Ummm, no. I'm not sure where to begin with this."  
  
The kindergarten students also think I go back to America to sleep every night, and I live with my parents. |-| 
|-| co0q1d5 || 193 || In high school we had an exchange student from Austria. She tried out to be a cheerleader because she thought it would be like the movies. She later realized it was a lot of work, commitment, and exercise lol |-| 
|-| co0tmwt || 188 || Not American, but Australian. While I was teaching in Romania, I was asked very seriously on multiple occasions:

 - How many times I'd been attacked by a crocodile
 - What it was like having a kangaroo for a pet
 - If I knew anyone who had been killed by spiders
 - If we had internet in Australia

The answers were 0, it's pretty okay, no, and kinda. |-| 
|-| co0x195 || 23 || Not a teacher, but I'm from tornado alley and a group of students in New Zealand asked me, "How do you get to school? Aren't there just tornadoes everywhere? It must be so scary." Apparently they thought that there are tornadoes everywhere all the time, and you just drive by on the road like "oh look, there's three tornadoes out today." |-| 
|-| co0uidd || 23 || *'Why is most of the world 'America'"?*

me: huh? what do you mean?

*"ya know, North America,  South America, Central America, Latin America, United States of America"*

He was from a very small place in South America, so we scrounged up a world map and talked about it for a couple hours. |-| 
|-| co0vmoq || 42 || 
I taught at a junior high school and elementary school in Japan. One of the ES students and I had this conversation:

"Sensei, how do you get to school?"
"I walk" (my house was actually right next to the school)
"HOW??? It's so far"
"What do you mean?"
"You walk from Canada *everyday*?"

lol and that was the day I realized my students thought I teleported back and forth between Canada/Japan every day, which sparked numerous exchanges along the lines of:

"You live here?"
"Yes, next to the school"
"In Japan?"
"yes"
"But you're not Japanese?"
"No"
"...But Japanese people live in Japan"
"Yes"
"...*but you're not Japanese*"

 |-| 
|-| co0t3qg || 76 || Some students in South America repeatedly insisted that Spanish is a much dirtier language than English, filled with double meaning and all that. I tried to convince them that English is too, but that not all of the jokes in movies translate well so they don't get it. I think most still don't believe me.

Of course, some students did get me once introducing a girl to me as Rosa Melano, which I later found out Rosa sounds like "roza" which means "rub", and Melano sounds like "me el ano" which when combined with the Rosa sounds like "rub my anus". They got me to go around saying that name a few times. |-| 
|-| co0uggl || 21 || Americans can't ride bikes because we are fat.  FROM GERMANY  |-| 
|-| co0vrbr || 21 || I'm Asian American and when I went abroad people refused to believe that I'm from the US.  |-| 
|-| co0s8k3 || 42 || As an American teaching in Japan right now..  Their favorite American music is Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, and One direction. I assistant teach high school and university students. 

 I honestly feel like they would never directly talk about a stereotype to a foreigner but if I do something that a foreigner would do then they would probably notice and talk to their friends about it. For example if I were to eat food outside in public they would probably notice and call me fat (I weigh 170 pounds). |-| 
|-| co0uf35 || 19 || I'm not American, but when I was in China I was mistaken for one (because apparently Westerner=American) and I was asked if you could get hamburgers for free at any store. |-| 
|-| co0u8l6 || 108 || I am not a teacher but I did basically help out with the foreign exchange students at my school for my senior year. 

A student from Germany thought that all American classes were beyond stereotypically easy. Imagine his horror when he went from regular physics in Germany straight into Calculus based physics and it beat him bad enough within the first 2 weeks that he had to transfer out of it. 

A student from Italy thought it was insane how Americans could be fat. After half of a semester and the wonders of chocolate chip cookies, she was wondering how she could stand eating such bland food again after she went back. Let's just say she apparently said when she first tried them she ate almost 3 dozen since they were so great. Also, she said that American schools were by far better and that after she completed her final year in Italy (they go for 13th grade), she was going to move here for the better schools and the better area.  |-| 
|-| co0uzmk || 57 || When exchanging in China, the first question always was why Americans like McDonalds so much... which was a real head-scratcher for me.  I have never seen an American McDonalds as jam packed as an Asian (or, for that matter, a European) McDonalds.  I mean Chinese kids would go there every single day, eat, do their homework in the seating area, then eat again.  It's like it was "the hangout."

One Chinese kid said his dad actually believed that the streets of San Francisco were made of gold.  Kid was smarter than that, though.

There was also always general confusion (as China is essentially a homogeneous country) about how someone that is not white could be American.  To them, Americans must be white.  There's no such thing as a black American.

Also spent some time working in tourist destinations in the US. Visiting Australians would *always* make mention of the huge portion sizes, then of course completely clean the plate.  I always found this odd, until I went to Australia and discovered that generally most places won't box up your eat-in food to go.  Apparently it's a health code issue -- which also seems odd, as after working for a short while in Australian restaurants, I found that they never wash their hands or use any type of sanitizer.  Anyway, so while many Americans would either not finish their plate or take the leftovers to go for later; Australians just finish it all in one sitting, then complain about it.

edit: also, the Australian portion sizes that I have seen are pretty much the same as you'd find in America, on average. |-| 
|-| co0tepe || 16 || When I was teaching in Cameroon and Obama was just elected President, they were all convinced it meant they could go to America then. They got almost as excited as they did during the games leading up to the world cup. |-| 
|-| co0rdqn || 31 || I was in Canada and got asked by a girl if I was afraid to walk down the street because of all the people with guns.  |-| 
|-| co0wdbx || 14 || Working in Japan here! 
My students have the weirdest assumptions. 

-all Americans have blonde hair and blue eyes
-all Americans eat hamburgers
-all foreigners can't use chopsticks
-America is dangerous and everyone carries guns

Also little kids will try to poke at your butt. The "games" called "kancho". 
Japanese kids are fucking weird. 

I will edit and post more if I think of them.  |-| 
|-| co0yqji || 14 || I taught English in China for a summer. One of the Chinese teachers, a college graduate, told me that China is vastly more ethnically diverse than America because " in America, you only have white people and black people" |-| 
|-| co0zp1w || 16 || I'm teaching in China and a lot of the students/people here believe that their pollution problem is America's fault. That we have brought giant ships of garbage across the ocean and dumped it in china.  |-| 
|-| co0xlom || 30 || I taught in a city in Northern China.  
-All Americans are rich, own multiple houses, cars, etc.  This was actually really difficult for me, because a lot of time people would tell me it was fair that I paid a higher price, because after all I was rich and the merchant was poor.  
-Shoot outs!  Shoot outs every day.  All the shoot outs.  
-All we eat is hamburgers, hot dogs and pizza.  
-We all hate black people.  Yeah this one was weird.  
-This one was kind of funny:  A girl told me she thought that all Americans deeply admired/looked up to Europeans (she spent her childhood in Europe).  I tried to explain to her that this wasn't the case, but she wouldn't take no for an answer.  I think she's in for the shock of her life if she ever turns on Fox News lol.  
-This is kind of weird, but we do not love our families, because we put grandparents in nursing homes, children move away for college and usually don't move back, etc.  
-We were doing a class on different beauty standards, and I showed them a picture of Kim Kardashian to point out traits Americans thought were beautiful.  So obviously Kim K has a small nose, big lips, high cheek bones, tan skin, slanted cats eyes, and a big butt.  I have none of those traits.  One of my students turned to me and said, "Oh!  is that why you came to China?  Because you're ugly in America?"  
-Also kind of funny, but for context:  
I'm a pretty normal size, 5'7 and ~135.  People in China asked if I was considered a freak back home because I wasn't obese.  Direct quote:  "Maybe the people think you are very very strange in your home, because you are not fat."  Uh, no?  
-Americans are smart.  I didn't expect this one, but a lot of people think that Americans are smart because we invent stuff.  I was actually really surprised by this. 

-Our houses are very dirty because we don't take off shoes. 

ETA: Ooh other stuff:
-Americans are very trusting.  After a few months, I could sort of see why, though: American culture is far less dependent on interpersonal relationships than Chinese are.  For instance, an American would have no problem renting an apartment from a landlord they only met once, as long as the lease and other docs were in order. In China, the contract has a LOT less power than in America, and enforcement of the lease terms (such as length of time you'll be permitted in the house and amount of rent paid) pretty much depends 100%on your relationship with the landlord.     
-In addition to being fat, Americans are also really tall.  One of my students introduced me to his mother, and she said (paraphrasing), "If she's an American...why is she so short?"  Again, I'm 5'7...not short by any means for a woman.  And my student replied, "Oh my god, mom, you can't just ask people why they're short!"  it was hilarious. 
-American people can't speak Chinese.  |-| 
|-| co0tfzc || 14 || One of my friends in Japan had an american teacher for english and the first question that was asked every single lesson was "why aren't you fat like the other americans" |-| 
|-| co0p7l2 || 266 || Damn you reply button! |-|

|-| co0tkqs || 41 || ITT: South Koreans don't know shit about America, and are kind of racist. |-| 
|-| co0utu0 || 12 || My kids here in Korea were shocked when I told them I couldn't remember my blood type, because pretty much everyone here knows theirs and it's supposedly related to personality traits. I told them that blood type isn't really that important to Americans, and they didn't seem to believe it.

While teaching fourth graders how to tell time, they told me that they go to bed anywhere between 11pm and 1am (!!), and they definitely didn't believe me when I said that 4th graders in America go to bed earlier than that. To them, I guess kids everywhere are sleep-deprived.

Also, a third grader once asked me why I'm so dark (I'm mixed black and white). |-| 
|-| co0xtl9 || 13 || teach economics in China.  

How many hamburgers do you eat a day in America?
Why is America full of gay people?
America is so dangerous! guns and tornadoes  (this was after a huge tornado hit Oklahoma and killed like 4 people, while an inch of rain in Beijing just killed 70) |-| 
|-| co0va2a || 24 || I would love to see a reverse thread from the rest of the world: what is the craziest thing Americans have said about your country?  |-| 
|-| co0xoxi || 11 || One of my favorite moments in Japan was when some colleagues asked where I was from and were puzzled when I told them Montana.

"What's your MLB team?" they asked, because that's apparently a good way to locate things in America. I laughed and told them we didn't have one.

"Well, what's the closest one?"

"Seattle, I guess," I told them, since it's, you know, only a twelve hour drive.

"Seattle! Ichiro!" they said enthusiastically. One guy always called me Ichiro after that. |-| 
|-| co0usog || 11 || Many foreigners in non-western countries, kids or adults, seem to think that America is only what they see in movies. They don't believe that there are poor people or homeless people. They think everyone is rich. |-| 
|-| co0wh7q || 11 || One of my students in Colombia thought because the US was such a rich country you could find a car on the side of the road and just hop in and start driving. He said Americans like new things, so once a car got old they would just leave it for a new one. |-| 
|-| co0y0tm || 11 || Being from California, students in Ireland would often ask what famous people I know, do I surf, do I live on the beach, was I a cheerleader. Also the shock when I explained to them how far apart states and major cities are- the look on their faces when I would tell them that Ireland is just about as close to NY as California is!  |-| 
|-| co0ocp8 || 270 || Fuck. I can not find that reply button. I am on the reddit app on my phone. |-| 
|-| co0q2dq || 121 || That every American believes 9/11 was an inside job from the government. 

Spent time in South Africa and after finding out I was American, they immediately wanted to know if I thought the US government did it. Got asked that same questions more times than I can count. It was amazing actually, and incredibly frustrating explaining "No, not everyone believes it, we find those people pretty crazy and delusional." Goddamn Truthers... |-| 
|-| co0wi50 || 34 || I KNOW this will very buried and no one will ever see it, but I have to tell it. I taught high school in China and a whole class of students thought that A) Martin Luther King Jr died about ten years ago, and B) that white people still to this day refuse to sit next to black people on the bus. -__- |-| 
|-| co0v1t9 || 11 || I didnt teach but I wound up moving to Chile when I was 12 (sort of a foreign exchange thing I did/do speak Spanish)
Many of the girls wanted to know if I knew all these famous people and were disappointed when I said no. I also was asked if all American rode horses to school, and the final question, my favorite, was why wasn't I cold. Because it was summer here in the states it was winter down there, and I was also in the northern part of the country, which is mostly desert. The coldest it ever got was around the low 60s (I'm from Texas) 

Edit: there was one more, and that was, "can I touch your hair?" Because I'm blond and they thought my hair would feel different.  |-| 
|-| co0w1hz || 10 || While in China I had coworkers who thought all Americans loved to travel, were adventurous, loved learning new languages, and we're wealthy enough to travel the world. I had to explain to them they had only met Americans who choose to travel to China (a not-touristy part) so their sample was not accurate. 
There was also the fun conversation about why they should not use the N word.  |-| 
|-| co0xnil || 11 || I am from Florida, and I spent a summer in England teaching in a summer school type deal. A lot of kids believed that since 1) I was from FL and 2) Disney World is in FL that I should personally know the famous actors from Disney TV shows. IDK how many times I was asked what Hannah Montana was like in person (that's right, not How Miley Cirus is, but literally Hannah Montana)

On a side note, they also thought I was was a redneck because I owned a small sized pickup, which I can't blame them for. Rednecks are 'known' to have huge trucks and compared to most European cars a 90s Toyota Tacoma is as big as a Ford F350 King Ranch.  |-| 
|-| co0xztd || 9 || On the first day of my study abroad adventure, I convinced my classmates that Americans still rode horses everywhere and that we had to survive attacks from Native Americans everyday. Being from Arizona really helped the story. |-| 
|-| co0y5k3 || 11 || Not teaching abroad, but my parents are Pakistani and we went to Pakistan for the first time in 13 years. 

I was asked quite a few times if all Pakistani people are treated as terrorists since 9/11. People were surprised when I said it's mainly the really old or dumb people that think so, as I've personally only had to deal with it like once or twice ever. 

But it really says a lot that I was asked this from so many people.  |-| 
|-| co0y8oe || 9 || In France I was asked if we bleached our eggs. It  was their best guess as to why we have white eggs as there are only brown ones in Europe. |-| 
|-| co0ydi4 || 9 || I'm teaching in China. They say I can't be from America because I don't have blonde hair and blue eyes. |-| 
|-| co11eox || 9 || Oh! Oh crap! I'm finally relevant for an askreddit thread! Ok don't blow it faxy.

I'm an American guy (25) teaching English in Japan. I used to teach at one of their English conversation schools, which was mostly made up of bored housewives. Now I teach junior high.

Nothing on my list may shock you, but these are the stereotypes of America I hear the most: 

1. Most people, if not everyone, has guns.
2. America started WW2 with the Japanese. (Ironically we teach the same thing reversed in America, the timetable of Japanese-American tension in WW2 doesn't start on December 7th, 1941.
3. Americans don't know how to use chopsticks. 
4. Black people are usually gangsters or criminals (racism in Japan is....complicated. Their perspective on black culture in America lacks the context of slavery and is more influenced by MTV from the 1980s.)
5. Americans are fat. (Not all stereotypes are wrong...)
6. American guys all have big dicks, and for some reason Japanese guys REALLY like to talk about how their dicks are smaller than American guys' dicks. Funnily enough, there's no major scientific evidence linking penis size to ethnicity. This is a stereotype that just keeps living on and no one really questions it. 
7. All American guys are playboys who cheat. (To be fair, a LOT of American guys over here turn into dicks.) |-| 
|-| co0ty9p || 26 || What I learned in this thread, Asian students are SUPER raciest against blacks. |-| 
|-| co0s4o3 || 25 || Canadian here. When teaching in China, I was asked earnestly if there are vampires in North America.  |-| 
|-| co0o071 || 173 || Yup probably did. |-| 
|-| co0vgv3 || 9 || Somewhat related. There's a video on YouTube, a Scot that moved to the US talking about some of the questions that he gets. 

One of the more ridiculous of them was if there was pollen in Scotland. His response was justifiably hysterical. You see, pollen is required for flowers and other plants to grow. 

The difference is that it that, apparently, the pollen doesn't cake their cars in the Spring like it does here in the US.  |-| 
|-| co0wmi4 || 10 || Everyone has guns. And this is not so much about America specifically, but when talking about the difference between their home country (Japan) and other countries, students often write about how safe Japan is. Which, in many respects, is certainly true, but you'd think they expect to be robbed and stabbed the moment they set foot in foreign soil.

Also apparently the only food we eat is hamburger, and everyone is shocked that I can use chopsticks (even though I'm Chinese-American) and don't mind eating raw fish (tell that to all the sushi-devouring college kids back home).

Also many don't have a perspective on just how big America is. I'm really happy and proud that y'all are going to San Francisco but I'm sorry, you won't have time to swing by Disney Land. |-| 
|-| co0y5w6 || 9 || Read this it's awesome if you haven't seen it yet, it's about a black guy who teaches English in Japan:

|-| co1104z || 9 || I taught a few English lessons in China while I was working there, and was surprised that only a few minutes into my first lesson there was a widespread gasp when I began writing basic phrases on the board. Several hands shot up into the air immediately, and I quickly realized that everyone's question was how long it took me to train myself to write with my left hand. 

The average age in the class was probably 35, and all had thus come from a generation where they were forcibly taught to write with their right hands even if they were natural lefties like myself. 

Not quite to the point of this thread, but it sure was interesting.  |-|

It was crazy. I showed them a video on my Android and their faces lit up. They thought that we paid people to get inside of our phones and act out plays, because Americans were so rich. I then showed them Reddit, and they were even more astounded at this public forum where everybody could speak freely. One of the students said "Wow, I bet all OPs in America tag their AskReddit threads as [Serious], right?" They were so stupid for thinking that. |-|

I wish.  |-| 
|-| co117hi || 6 || I'm in Japan.  Had an educated middle-aged guy tell me he thought it was strange that we traditionally used pumpkins during Halloween.  I asked him why he thought that. He goes, "it must be very expensive."  I'm like, "Uhhh, why?"  "Because it must be expensive importing all those pumpkins from Japan."  Dude thought all the worlds pumpkins came from Japan.  When I tried to convince him otherwise, he didn't believe me, until I asked him where he got his pumpkins.  When he told me he got his from Yamanaka (grocery store), I was like, "We pick ours from the ground."  He was still skeptical. |-|

|-| co0x45w || 6 || Had a friend from France my first year in college. He was genuinely surprised that a) Americans ate at restaurants other than McDonald's. He and all of his friends assumed that all Americans ate there, and was surprised that so many people he talked to hated it. And b) that people here exercised in gyms. Apparently in France, people under 18 aren't allowed gym memberships? He thought running on a treadmill was the weirdest thing ever. |-| 
|-| co0ytwv || 6 || When I was in China teaching, I got asked if I knew how to pole dance multiple times. I didn't think that I look like a stripper :(

|-| co0z703 || 5 || A close friend had a French exchange student stay with his family in HS. While gstting ready for prom, he asked if my buddy had any condoms assuming EVERYONE got laid.  Also when he went to a Taco Bell for the first time, and looked at the menu thoughtfully for a bit before saying "I would like a cheeseburger". |-| 
|-| co10dod || 5 || A little bit of background: I moved overseas to South Korea teach English two weeks after September 11. I had traveled overseas before, but I'd never lived overseas so the many eye openers combined with the background of the terror attacks in my home made for quite the experience.

Some of my older students thought it was common for Americans to know each other. They also did not quite grasp American sarcasm. So when I met a guy in a bar and he asked me if I knew "Dan from Chicago," I assumed he was joking and said something along the lines of: "Dan?! Course I know Dan! Who doesn't?! What a guy! Remember that time he did that thing…"

This poor man got so excited that I knew Dan. Turns out he lived in my town, and every time I saw him he'd ask me if I had spoken with or emailed Dan. I just didn't have the heart (or the nerve) to try to explain then I didn't actually know Dan. But Dan did sound like a really great guy, so there's that.

Some of my teenage students were shocked that I didn't how to use chopsticks. I was in a small town, but they watched a lot of movies and figured it was a "movie device," for dramatic effect. Nothing more thrilling than a fork and a knife I suppose.

Car seats weren't used for infants much to my shock and horror. When I explained that it was illegal in the United States to travel with the baby in the car (as I held my friends' kid on my lap for a 2 hour drive), I was told that it was because Americans are such poor drivers (no argument here!), and that they "wouldn't get into an accident." They just knew somehow. I didn't bother mentioning that South Korea had some of the highest amount of vehicular accidents anywhere in the world, and that on average there was one every 60 seconds in their country.

Anyways most people from the US just eat with a fork in one hand - the old lady said that she thought the reason americans only ate with one hand was because they needed to keep one hand free to use their gun.  
Can anyone confirm this is an actual belief?   |-| 
|-| co10xk5 || 4 || A friend of my father is from an atoll (I forget which one). So remote that they got two supply shipments a year from the U.S. government and there were so few people there that if you wanted to get married, you were going to at the very least marry a cousin.

They had one film projector and a white sheet they would put up to watch old western films. They LOVED John Wayne movies - so much so that when he died in a movie, the whole atoll went into mourning because they thought he was a real-life hero.

When my dad's friend decided to move to the U.S. for college, his grandmother warned him to be very careful of all the indians and to avoid getting into gunfights. |-| 
|-| co10xnu || 4 || I teach English in Cambodia (1 year volunteer program), and I told one of the older students that I was from California.

|-| co134na || 4 || I'm not a teacher, but after visiting Russia, my Russian friends thought every American loved peanut butter.  They figured this out by watching out tv and movies.  Apparently they scrutinize everything in the kitchens on tv and they said in every american show and movie they've seen, there is always peanut butter in the fridge or cupboard.   |-| 
|-| co0xhow || 10 || I'm late to the party, but I was a TA in Spain for a year in rural Galicia (aka the middle of nowhere). My students had some really strange conceptions of the United States, but the worst thing I heard came from the principal of my school.

I was working the day after the shooting at [Sandy Hook](http://nypost.com/2012/12/14/at-least-27-people-including-20-children-shot-dead-at-elementary-school-in-connecticut/), all of the teachers, myself included, were shocked and horrified at what happened. When I arrived to school that morning the principal made a beeline towards me, looked me in the face and asked how *I*, personally, could have let that happen. He proceeded to passionately rant about how it was my personal responsibility to vote against the right to bear arms, how it was literally my fault that things like this happened, and how terrible was the nation from which I came. After he stopped his diatribe, I was hurt and seriously taken aback; he knew little about me, and nothing of my politics or opinions of gun rights (which are very far left). I looked around the room and all the teachers looked embarrassed and angry at what he had said, and some of them came to my defense. 

To say the least, the rest of the year was tense and awkward when he was in the vicinity. 

tl;dr: the principal of my school blamed me for all gun violence in the United States. |-| 
|-| co0w4wd || 8 || To flip this round. When I was in America I was asked whether we have trees in Europe, how did we survive the Winter (I guess because we're the same latitude as Canada), someone tried to explain to me Mexican food as if I'd never seen it. There are dumb people all over. |-| 
|-| co0yrlc || 6 || Not a teacher but my cousin thought calling someone "noodle" was a legitimate insult. |-| 
|-| co0wj19 || 3 || Went to Africa for a bit with a group of Americans. Groups of kids would come up to me on the street and grab and feel my hair (I'm blonde); a lot of people expected us all to be blonde-haired, blue-eyed. |-| 
|-| co0wvse || 4 || Did some teaching in China. 

I was asked if I lived near the beach. No, I explained that I grew in Arizona. Even though this was a nearly decade after his retirement, the class started talking about Charles Barkley and doing free throw motions. I was shocked, because I had prepared myself to talk about how there are no longer "cowboys and indians," in the cinematic sense. |-|

|-| co0zvnm || 4 || I am not a teacher. I am white guy retired in the Philippines. A kid about 10 was asking me all these legit questions about the U.S. Then, just as serious as he could be, he asks, " are there a lot of niggers there?"
I cracked up laughing, because I know he did not understand it to be derogatory. I told him, yes, there are a lot of black people, then explained that using the word to blacks was not a nice thing to do. He seemed cool with it. |-|

 |-| 
|-| co10ken || 3 || I am not a teacher but I am American. While in Switzerland and Germany, kids saw America as the world's greatest country and a country they have to visit before they're 30. A mundane Chrysler Grand Voyager was an object of desire to some, there was literally 2 teen girls in Germany taking selfies in front of one. america is nowhere nearly as good as those two country to me.

EDIT: they also only know about american celebs, barack obama, and think all of america is like NYC/LA/Miami/etc. |-| 
|-| co10lt8 || 4 || Not a teacher, but I visited a boyfriend in Paris and he wanted me to come to his English class. I was bombarded with questions, but my favorite was the importance of solo cups. What about the red cups?! Do you only have them at parties?! when i told them that they came in other colors it was as if i had dropped a bomb.  |-| 
|-| co10o3u || 4 || Dang it! I'm late for one of my favorite stories! Last year my student (in China) asked me if I had ever seen a vampire. I said no, of course not. They said they had hoped I had met one because they only live in America, China has no vampires. They were very sad to find out vampires are not real.  |-|

|-| co1150k || 3 || I'm not a teacher, but an American student in the Middle East. A lot of the locals here think everyone in America is rich/famous and has just sooooo much money to spend on anything. They think anyone living in America has the high life and it's the absolute epitome of greatness and enjoyment. They don't like Americans that walk around that much bc they're annoyed at them just from sheer jealousy. They also always taunt new American tourists by saying stupid things in their (mostly) broken accent "Hey! Justin Beiber, Lebron James, Rihanna! I went to highschool with those people!" And other ridiculous comments about how they invented Facebook and own the Yankees.   |-| 
|-| co11cfy || 3 || American teaching English in a small town in southern Italy.  They can't believe I travel alone, and not with husband, a friend or family.  Italians rarely go anywhere alone, and I mean anywhere.  They are also astounded that I live alone here, and ask me "Aren't you afraid?"  When I've asked, "Afraid of what?", nobody has had an answer.

Also, I'm kind of surprised at people's reactions and what they *don't* say when they find out where I'm from.  People usually think I'm English, German, Russian or something else at first, then when they find out I'm from the US, they clam up.  Maybe afraid I'll shoot them?  Have to find out. |-| 
|-| co125jq || 3 || I went to camp with a kid from Hong Kong once. He would always use the phrase "blue brain". One time we asked him what it meant and he said "you know, when a person always think things about girls? Like sex think." When we tried to tell him that the phrase is dirty mind, he got really upset and insisted that blue brain was what we called it here in the US. |-| 
|-| co12hzl || 3 || Not a teacher, but. Once I was in a taxi in Paris and the driver asked me where I was from, in broken English. I told him, America. He immediately asked me if I knew Obama and if he was a good president. I said he was okay, and the guy starts quizzing me on how good certain presidents were/are. "What about Reagan? Was he good?" "Roosevelt? He good guy?" "Do you remember Clinton? Was he ok?" 

I was born when Bush Sr. was president so I could not accurately answer. I just said yes and kinda asked him about his favorite presidents. He says he likes Roosevelt, never specified which though. Kind of a funny experience.   |-| 
|-| co13bjc || 4 || Student living in Germany here. It is the common belief that all American girls are extremely hot.
They have been dissapointed on multiple occasions.  |-| 
|-| co13ccq || 3 || I wasn't a teacher but I lived in Burkina Faso in west Africa for two years. There was a large number of my employees that not only didn't know what American slavery was, but were baffled when black American workers start coming to the job site. It was the hardest thing to explain, what's more with language barriers. This was the year Obama was elected, so soon after all the commotion I stirred up with my history lesson, everyone's head spun off when news reached us about our first black president. 

Also, this is off topic, but I had to break my employees on the habit of calling me "master" - easily the most mortified I've ever been in my entire life. It was as natural to them as me saying sir or ma'am, so it took a ridiculous amount of time. It was awful.  |-| 
|-| co0t1wf || 5 || I had a student ask me if we eat humans because we don't have enough meat to eat

|-| co0x0g1 || 5 || we had some exchange students come in a few years ago. A couple from around the U.K., one from France and one from the Holland. It was a lot of the same stuff everyone keeps saying. We had to explain to them we dont have a mcdonalds on every corner, we dont sleep with our shoes on, we did take them to a gun range though. Then,we took them to see the Book Of Mormon Musical. It was really tough having to explain the satire of it, after having explained america wasnt every sterotype they thought it was. They were so confused by the end, we had to spend two hours on google showing the jokes to them, and ended up seeing it a second time before they got it. They did enjoy it the second time |-| 
|-| co0sva9 || 4 || I'm from Canada and I was teaching in Tanzania. Everyone thought we lived in mansions. I pointed to a house across the street and said my house back in Canada was that exact size, which was a small, single floor house. They also thought we all had our own cars.  |-|

|-| co0y52z || 5 || I taught English in Myanmar/Burma, and something I encountered every day were students asking me to describe my perfect American life in perfect America. It's not crazy in a "whoa, that's bananas" kinda way, but it was crazy how insistent they were about the flawlessness of the US. I had multiple conversations with my students attempting to explain that there is no perfect country...we're all a little fucked up. These conversations were pointless-- they'd all shrug and maintain their 
"America is perfect" mindset. It blew my mind in a way, because, when I'm here, a lot seems so wrong. Yet, there's a huge population of people a world away thinking that this wrong place is flawless. |-|

|-| co0zu7y || 3 || I was an American English teacher in Vietnam for two years. I got into a bit of an awkward conversation with another teacher about the meaning of the word chocolate chip. He was Vietnamese and had been taught British English and thought it was far more superior than American English. He couldn't imagine what a chocolate chip tasted like and asked me one day over lunch. I told him that it was just a small piece of chocolate and that it tasted just like chocolate. He informed me that I was wrong and that a chip was a fried potato and therefore a chocolate chip was a fried potato with chocolate and I must have never had one in America and didn't understand what it was. I let it go and just ate my lunch. I really didn't know how I could prove my point since neither thing existed in Vietnam. This was before smartphones btw. |-|

In Baseball, each team should get an additional player called a "rover."  The rover would be free to roam the stands, disguised as a casual fan, and if they catch another team's foul ball/homerun it would be an automatic out. Now since they're in disguise, they would be subject to all the normal conditions of the average fan, i.e. someone could pick a fight with them, they could get ejected, etc., so you would have to choose your rover carefully, taking the skills needed to navigate such conditions into account.  

It would also add another strategic element to the game in the form of where you place your rover. In foul territory where their more likely to get a ball? First base or third base line?  Or in the outfield for the less likely but more enticing possibility of catching a homerun? And since catching a ball as a fan is so rare, anytime a rover did make a catch people would lose their shit. And as certain rovers got more and more famous they'd have to come up with increasingly elaborate disguises, making it all the more dramatic when they finally reveal themselves after a catch.

Just imagine.  Bottom of the ninth, two outs, the home team hits what appears to be a game tying home run.  The stadium erupts, until a fan stands up with the caught homerun ball held high, removes his hat and fake moustache, and OH SHIT ITS THE ROVER.  I REPEAT THE ROVER CAUGHT THE HOMERUN.  Security guards rush over and validate his rover identification card, and thats it folks game over.   |-|

Some of the corruption is blatant payoffs, but most is more discrete.  What I mean by corruption is the use of power within a game to distort the rules of that game for personal gain.  Power in this context is generally money, but it can also be political clout or even just connections with someone who has money or clout.  Personal gain can also be that I personally favor people so to me a gain for them is in a way a gain for me.  This means it covers everything from bribes and nepotism to superpacs, lobbies, and think-tanks.  

The problem is we're too busy playing this power game to set aside our differences and deal with a number of impending crises that have the potential to ruin any gains which might be made in the game.  While we all stand to lose like this, most don't have much of a say and those who do are too busy bickering over which of them gets more say to notice the clock running out. |-|

Over the past 30 years, Iran has very carefully cultivated a Shiite ring from Lebanon (Hizbollah), Syria (Assad) and Eastern/Southern Iraq (Iraqi national gov't). Net result? Saudi Arabia, the seat of the Sunni empire and bitter rivals to Iran, is encircled.

The countries have been dueling in the shadows for years, but a few things have changed for the worse recently. First, ISIS/ISIL/Daesh. Sunni monsters (and monsters is really all you can call them), have threatened everyone in the area. They pose a threat to the Shiites as they view them as heretics fit to be executed on sight. And they pose a threat to Sunni nations as they encourage a citizen uprising against the monarchies/dictatorships in those countries. Second, Yemen's capitol has just fallen to Iranian-backed Shiite rebels, further encircling Saudi Arabia. Third, Saudi's king has died and the only clear succession goes through a series of 70+ year olds. Oh, and for good measure, Iranian generals were recently killed by Israel...while they were scouting the Lebanon/Israeli border for what was feared to be an attack on Israel.

Things seem normal now. But this is a cauldron of greater instability that could easily lead to an all-out regional war, one that could quickly drag in the US if Israel is seriously beaten. |-|

|-| co06b5q || 393 || The fact that we have already passed the point of no return with the global warming thing. Even if every country in the world, every person, just suddenly stopped everything that increases the problem, it's too late; there is no stopping the events. |-|

The US$ has strength because other countries need it to buy oil. The petrodollars pay for the US military and the US military keeps oil producing countries in line by having them accept US$ for their oil.

Imagine a world where the USA cannot afford to have a large military. Some good will come of that and some BAD will come of it, especially for Americans. |-|

We've reached the point where no amount of effort will reverse climate change, and we don't currently have the motivation to stop it. There are people who've been telling us for years about the implications, governments have pledged to take action, and yet they back out of their promises, leaving the situation worse than before. There's barely any coverage in mainstream media and most people don't even want to think about it.  |-|

|-| co07xh2 || 217 || Russian descent into fascism. Western people do not realize just how brainwashed average Russians are. The TV is a Putin propaganda machine blaming 'the west' for all their suffering. And their suffering is getting worse very quickly. They have already shot down a civilian airliner. Now they have bombarded a city with rockets. Putin has gone mad. He is starting a war. They are bristling with nuclear weapons. That is scary as fuck. |-| 
|-| co0j8fx || 84 || Everything. All of it. the world is so fucked right now *you don't even know*. The top 1% of humans owning over 50% of global wealth by 2016. The blue collar working class devolving to slavery. Extremists from all walks of life rampaging on eachother, civilians too. Suicide nets in chinese sweatshops. Violent opression to peaceful protests. The fact that *nobody* seems to understand if we don't make the time to get out of our own planet and colonize off planet where we can, the bombs we waste efforts and resources on are a foreshadow of what will happen to humanity. Straight across the board our planet is going through hard climate change. Im aware thats what planets do but i'll be damned if we haven't sped the everloving hell out of it. In the meantime, lets just sit back in our cozy rented living rooms and say "gee, I sure am glad I live here and not *there*. " Eventually you'll realize that from the time you were born somebody **owned** you. not your parents, but your government. you need to pay for a place to live, pay *them* for land to live on. you're not allowed to farm your own food or build anywheres you want. none of it is yours. And you. can't. leave. If you refuse the system you were born into you might face incarceration or slow, wretched, nomadic existence and a sickly, painful death .  |-|

|-| co0epyy || 18 || Money is losing its value.
When you watch the experts talk about the stock market, bonds or business valuations there is a hidden truth.

They have no idea what these things are actually worth. Over the last 8 years trillions of dollars have been created out of thin air. There hasn't been rampant inflation yet because many theoretical economists believe they have it under control. (They being central banks.).
The truth is that printing money alone will not cause inflation. It must have velocity. It must circulate. When all of that money moves from the balance sheets of the banks and out into circulation disaster may strike quickly. Then the speculators will jump in and inflation across the globe will reach triple and quadruple digit levels if not more.
When this happens there will be no easy fix as there will be no stable reserve currency anywhere in the world.
What will you be able to do to barter for food, gasoline and shelter?

Throughout history when these events unfold they lead to large regional wars. What will happen when it is world wide catastrophe?

Global warming, gay rights income inequality and other problems will disappear over night. The problem will be survival.

Most politicians, bankers and even the Federal Reserve Board members know that this is a problem. No one has any solution. They are waiting patiently and there only friend is hope. The hope that it won't happen. But not one of them can sketch a scenario where it does not. The only question is how long the smoke and mirrors can hold civilized society together.
That is the single scariest thing happening in the world right now. And the average person has no idea. |-|

Farming cattle represents 30-50% of greenhouse gas emissions, whereas all transportation (trains, planes, cars, and boats) accounts for only 13%.

Farming cattle represents 91% of global deforestation.

Farming cattle is the reason there is hundreds of square miles of dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico from chemical and other waste.

One hamburger takes 2,000-2,500 gallons of water to produce, or the equivalent of a two month long shower.

For starters, the American education and news channels are so terrible that it wouldn't be an exaggeration to label a large American population as idiots and ignorant.  It wouldn't be a long time before the US loses its position as a global leader. In fact many other countries have a higher literacy rate with the general population being able to think more critically and more aware of international affairs than their American peers (Japan, South Korea, UK to name a few).  American influence is on the decline with China setting up an Asian equivalent of the World Bank, not that it's really a bad thing since China doesn't fuck with other countries as much as the U.S.  Hell the US isn't even the best place to live in anymore. You guys pay $50 a month for shitty Internet while people in Seoul and Hong Kong pay less than half of that for a 100 Mbps connection with zero downtime. 

Global warming. Even though countries have recently decided to step up and finally admit that this is actually a pressing issue, all the agreements to cut back emissions are really just for show. We are really headed for doomsday.   China is polluting the earth like fuck and our supply of fresh water is declining at an alarming rate.

Privatization of the space industry. Although this is regarded as a good thing, it's really a double edge sword. With NASA budget being cut and space exploration being delegated more and more to the private sector it will now be more about earning profits for shareholders than for the betterment of mankind. If earth were to be inhabitable in the next 2 centuries and we have to resort to living in space colonies, only the rich will get to go (Elysium, anyone?) Privatization will also mean companies will focus more on the tourism aspects of space rather than to really further our knowledge of the Galaxy. Just like we've been using the same technology for automobiles for the past 100 years, we'll be probably using the same shit for launching shuttles to space one century from now. 

And no I don't think the Ukraine crisis and Russia are really are as big of a problem as American media likes to portray. Stop watching Fox and CNN.

Also ISIS isn't that big of a problem since we can technically kill them all with a flick of a finger if all countries really stepped up to put troops on the ground  

EDIT: I just finished reading most of the comments here and as a non American, it's really sad to see how ignorant many of the commenters are. For the love of God stop eating the bullshit CNN and Fox are feeding you.  |-|

|-| co0blry || -3 || There's a lot of shit going on in the world and I'm going to say a few of them. 

1) Racist Tensions in the United States-- Racism has gotten to a point that when a white police officer shoots and kills a thug that was threatening him, whole cities erupt in protest fighting for "justice" when really they're using it as an opportunity to pillage and terrorize. Racism has reached a point where basically anything a white person is racist. What politicians and civilians don't understand is the best way to end racism is to stop talking about racism, because these racism debates only fuel more racism. 

2) The Threat Posed to Catholicism-- It's kinda of the same deal with racism. People seem to hate Catholics for no reason. In public places Jewish menorahs can stand but when people set up a nativity scene, others are offended and demand that it be taken down. At a college campus the Islamic sound of prayer can be played across the campus but a pro-life rally is cancelled. They say this is fair, but really it's the exact opposite of fair..

3) Terrorism-- Honestly, there isn't much that needs to be said. Al Qaeda/ISIS are the biggest threats to the people of the world today. 

I have lots more to say but I'm going to spare you all from having to read a long post.  |-|

I mean, I don't know if I really do, but I like you a lot so I could see it going that direction."

|-| co0ai7p || 212 || "ok" |-| 
|-| co0bqfg || 141 || He laughed and said "Oh BabyfacedLoneWolf..." After that, I vowed not to say I love you first to anyone again. 

But I love that guy and couldn't help it. Quite some time later, I reached a point when I realized I didn't care if he didn't love me. I just had to express it. So I said it again. Funnily enough, that's when he said it back. It's all good.  |-|

|-| co0opeq || 181 || Ok so here's the story but I'm going to skip a lot of the better parts in order for it to stay relevant to the question. senior year of highschool my ex is upset that I dumped her so she decides to confess her love to my best friend and hero who we will call "Paul". After a long and awkward confession of how she has loved him for the past three months, Paul responds "I don't know what to do with this information".  Before he can leave her with her dignity ex asks him "what would you say if I asked you out right now?" To which Paul gives a simple "No". AND THEN PROCEEDS TO TURN AROUND AND GLIDE AWAY ON HIS HEELY'S leaving her in a cloud of dust and humiliation. |-| 
|-| co0mpuf || 59 || My ex and I used to do the "I love you more" thing.  He'd say I love you and I'd say I you more and then he'd say no, I love YOU more.  I know, disgusting.  Anyway the last new year's eve we celebrated together, at midnight he said I love you and I said I love you more, and he said, "you're probably right."   He ended up cheating on me.  I guess that was his way of warning me of what was to come lol. |-|

|-| co0ahta || 11 || I think I love you a little. |-| 
|-| co0b8t3 || 10 || Left, no response to calls or texts for almost as week. We broke up after that. |-| 
|-| co0g3qd || 9 || She said it back but added "like you're my brother. " |-| 
|-| co0bgnp || 24 || I like cake. |-| 
|-| co0g3ab || 22 || ...... SEE YA IN CHEMISTRY |-| 
|-| co0bbns || 18 || Never said it but, been told it wayyyy to early in the relationship and over text message. I honestly just didn't answer for like 10 minutes and then when he finally asked "why are you not replying," I honestly just said sorry but, I don't love you I like you but not love you. Come to find out later that he pretty much does that to every single girl he dates. |-| 
|-| co0bqj2 || 8 || "I'm sorry"  |-| 
|-| co0bpop || 15 || "I love you"

"And you know that I can't say the same back to you."

 |-| 
|-| co0c4k1 || 5 || It was a lack of response when I almost always got an emphatic response back to having said the words. I did it about three times over the course of two days and never received acknowledgement. She instead started talking about other things. How did I feel, some art or music, anything but what I had just said. 

I knew something was wrong. The relationship ended at the end of that second day.  |-| 
|-| co0f10d || 7 || *click* Phone hangs up. |-| 
|-| co0f3fl || 7 || "Oh" |-| 
|-| co0g9w0 || 15 || "...I know. I know you do. You're my best friend, and I want to be able to love you with no doubts, but I can't. Is it possible to be in love with two people? I don't know. I do know that I care about you very much and I don't want to hurt you anymore. So I need time alone for a while so I can think and figure it all out."

It happened years ago and I can still remember how I felt. We've both moved on since then, but damn if that didn't feel like the worst possible response at the time. |-| 
|-| co0c4lz || 48 || "can we meet up for some kisses now?" |-| 
|-| co0aj05 || 15 || Go fuck yourself. |-| 
|-| co0c6k1 || 12 || "You look Asian" |-| 
|-| co0zjig || 11 || Oh shit, I have a real one this time!

The first time I told my (now wife) girlfriend I thought I loved her was after a party, in college.  She hesitated and said, "Would you be offended if i go throw up right now?"

And she did.  Then I wifed that bitch like five years later. |-| 
|-| co0ajsi || 6 || Belly laugh... |-| 
|-| co0e3yf || 5 || "I love me too" we ended up together so it was all ok in the end. |-| 
|-| co0ht0g || 5 || DH said, "I know Wilma (dog's name), I know..."  

Turns out, he was asleep already when I told him, but he usually says it back, asleep or awake, just that night, I got the dog treatment... |-| 
|-| co0ajt2 || 4 || "Yea you too bud!" Like what? We don't talk much anymore. |-| 
|-| co0q48h || 4 || Shut up!  That is awesome sauce! |-| 
|-| co0wgh0 || 4 || Well this is technically answering the question: back when I first started dating my wife, we had *just* finished a bedroom session... She said "I love you", and I said "I love you too Jenn". I think this was the first time I said the magic words. 

All in all, a beautiful moment. Except one little detail: my wife's name is not Jenn. That is my *ex's* name. That whole situation was definitely awkward...  |-| 
|-| co10jt5 || 4 || First he tried to ignore me, which I didn't realize right away and then he said "uhm... thanks?"  Then he turned over and went to sleep :/
about a week later he was having a house party and I got really drunk.  I was crying and complaining to our friends about how it was the first time I ever told a guy I love you first and he made me feel like crap and blah blah blah. He walked over and yelled at me about how the entire house hears me whining.  Then we went into his room and had a huge argument about it where he then yelled at me that he loves me too.... 10 years later and we are happily married with a kid and a mortgage lol   |-| 
|-| co0aujk || 3 || Thanks... |-| 
|-| co0aznd || 3 || "Thanks!" =.= |-| 
|-| co0b476 || 3 || Saying nothing at all. |-| 
|-| co0b9am || 3 || Silence. I hid my head in shame.

Never again.  |-| 
|-| co0bahb || 3 || "yeah!"

*really awkward silence where she looks at you expecting to say something more, but you're staring at her expecting her to say it back* |-| 
|-| co0ete8 || 3 || "I know."

Ugh, that was a quiet ride home. |-| 
|-| co0f4tu || 3 || no response at all... that hurts... |-| 
|-| co0i8f9 || 3 || "Dude! That's totally awesomesauce!" |-| 
|-| co0ijpi || 3 || "I'm pregnant." followed by uncontrollable sobs |-| 
|-| co0ko16 || 3 || I was talking to my crush who was my best friend at the time and I let "I love you" slip when I was talking to her, she paused with a weird look on her face then said "er, were in 8th grade, it may be a bit early for that..."
We started dating a couple weeks later.
She broke up with me a couple weeks ago.
We're still good friends. |-| 
|-| co0lofa || 3 || They texted me back with: ... |-| 
|-| co0o07s || 3 || I had a boyfriend uncomfortably tell me they loved me. We were talking about how much we enjoyed each other's families and he said: "I love your mom, and I love you!" After staring at the ground for minute while we walked I said, "I love you too, I mean I wouldn't want anything to happen to you." We dated another 12 months or so, I guess my response was appropriate.  |-| 
|-| co0srqd || 3 || Me: "I love you.."
Her: "OMG I love you too, and I have for a long time, I just didn't know how to say it"

And that's when I realized I fucked up, royally. |-| 
|-| co0sxlm || 3 || "So it's come to this." |-| 
|-| co10xpv || 3 || Yknow that sound that Tina from bob's burgers makes when she's asked a question or keeping a secret?

That.  |-| 
|-| co1124v || 3 || My boyfriend at the time (now my husband) first said it to me late one night before we went to bed, and I said it back. I woke up the next morning, and he was asleep on the couch. When I asked him why he was on the couch, he said he was super drunk the night before and blacked out, and couldn't remember anything. I assume that either A) he regrets saying it so he's pretending to have blacked out, or B) honestly doesn't remember saying it. So a couple weeks go by and neither of us have said it again, and he finally says "Hey, remember what I told you a couple weeks ago? How come you haven't said it since?" And then I had to explain how the situation seemed from my POV. All in all, it was very indicative of the weirdness we share. :) |-| 
|-| co0h4t6 || 3 || "I like you a lot but... I can't say I feel the same about you" |-| 
|-| co0lp4h || 3 || I said it to a friend, in a friendly familial way. He replied "Can you please stop saying that because I really don't care about you that much." He is very blunt and has a weird sense of humour, so he may have been joking...but it still hurt to hear.  |-| 
|-| co0cquw || 4 || "I love you, too" |-| 
|-| co0ggyu || 4 || Say it again, I double dog dare you, motherfucker. |-| 
|-| co0f3vm || 3 || I'm surprised there's no "see ya in chemistry" jokes yet. |-| 
|-| co0om4t || 743 || I used to work the nightshift at a nursing home. The entire experience in and of itself was terrifying. I'd be sitting at the nurse's station between bed checks and someone's call light would go off. It's pitch black in this nursing home except a few lights on here and there for you to see. You get up, pager in hand, and head to the room, only to be ambushed by the old man with Alzheimer's who thinks it's time for breakfast. And during the lull, you're constantly checking the hallways, flipping lights on and off, swearing you're always hearing Mr. Old Man's breathing, even though you just put him back to bed. 

You know how people think Five Nights at Freddy's isn't real? Ha. Bullshit.  |-| 
|-| co0vc3k || 323 || Worked at a 24 hours college minimart on the edge of campus right next to a river. On saturdays I would work 9-2 and again from 9-4 that night. 

One cold winter, snowy, night, I see someone climb out of the river and walk over to the store. He was beat and cut to hell and was limping as well as dripping wet. He picked out a pack of cigarettes, a lighter, a small bottle of coke, and a college jacket. He started patting down for his wallet, but he didn't have any. I told him it was OK and that I'll take care of it (it seems like he was having a bad day, I just put in "student athlete" in our computer as they got anything for free under $100). He gave me this look like I just gave him a million dollars.

He then went outside, put the jacket, lit a cigarette up and walked down the road.


He never said a word. 

 |-| 
|-| co0v226 || 397 || I was a janitor when I was younger. This was a huge building with several different companies in it. I was vacuuming the 10th floor when I see a computer turned on. I had passed it no more than half an hour earlier and all the screens were off. I figured I had bumped the desk or something earlier and woke it up. A few minutes later I get a call from my friend/coworker blaming me for trying to spook him. He was running a floor polisher in the lobby and apparently one of the elevators showed up with no one in it. Later that night we closed up the building and after trying to activate the security system, it warned us that a door by the loading dock was open. Sure as hell, it was held open with a rolled up magazine. Neither of us would have done this, it was a secure building, requiring key cards for almost every door. Chills kind of go down my spine. We piece everything together and come to the conclusion that someone who should not have been up there was up there. With me. Alone. On the way down, we assumed they accidentally hit the lobby button, so they got off at another floor, then went down to the level B and snuck out the back. We immediately call the building manager. He hauls ass over and asses the situation. Some higher-ups who were renting the office space show up freakishly fast. As I'm laying in bed, thoughts about who the fuck that was and what they were doing raced through my head. Someone stealing data? CIA? Did we catch a spook? The very next night, there were several security guards watching us like hawks. The entire situation was very odd, and very hushed.  |-| 
|-| co0n5im || 339 || Then there's the lady who roller skates in our parking lot at like 2 or 3 in the morning every once in awhile. 
 
She looks like she came straight out of the seventies, giving it all she's got, dancing to her own tune, although she might have headphones on as well. It's been awhile since I've seen her.  |-| 
|-| co0s7ho || 312 || i used to do graveyard shifts at a suicide hotline.  we covered only a small city, so unless it the holidays (the busy season) there was only one person on at night to man the phones.  the organization that ran the hotline wasn't based out of some office building, instead it was an old house that had been converted; the phone room was in the basement.

we had a person who was a repeat caller, and interestingly enough, used to actually work at the hotline.  anyway, he used to call only during the graveyard shifts, and the calls would start off "normal", but then he would start to ask personal questions.  then he would tell whoever was on the phone that he was in the building.  he would say how he got in (climbed through a window), and he would say that he was in the top level of the building, and about to make his way downstairs.

imagine the movie "Scream"... however this was in the early 90's before that movie even came out.  it was terrifying when he would call.   |-| 
|-| co0v5f2 || 291 || This happened a while ago in a hospital setting. A girl and her father had consensually had sex and had a baby. Their daughter was a patient on our unit. Mom and dad were at bedside with the child, and the two would sleep together on a pull out couch in the hospital room at night. Sparing major details, it was a strange situation. Anyways, I was working night shift one night and caring for this family. Somewhere around 3 am, I was sitting alone at the main desk. The lights were dimmed, everyone was asleep, and everything was absolutely silent. The grandfather/father quietly emerges from the room and surprises me at the front desk with a small, plastic, toy car. He places it on my desk, pushes it back and forth, and says "Come on baby, can I take you for a ride?"  |-| 
|-| co0n6pg || 270 || My mate worked night shifts at a petrol station, I often gave him a lift on my way home as I worked lates. One night dropped him off and went in the shop with him as I wanted some snacks, the late shift guy was nowhere to be seen. My mate went in the back to check if he was there and after a few seconds shouted me. The guy was lying on the floor with his trousers half down, belt tied round his ankle, no shoes or socks on with a needle stuck in his foot which had ballooned to the size of a football.

We think the dipshit was trying to inject heroin into a vein in his foot and either missed, been sold something else or cut off the blood flow with the belt. He survived but was fired. |-| 
|-| co0q7qg || 202 || Boyfriend used to do overnights at a gas station. He would always tell me about this one guy who would come in barefoot, buy lots of whipped cream cans and go straight into the bathroom with them.

One time after doing this, he walked out of the bathroom and into the cooler in the back. When my boyfriend went and asked what he was doing, the man replies "looking for the bathroom." |-| 
|-| co0woki || 121 || I work 3rd at a prison. It sometimes get creepy being locked in a room with 150 inmates sleeping in the pitch black. But then they normally break the silence by farting. |-| 
|-| co0tj0d || 160 || Sweeping the floor alone in the firehouse at 2am and found a middle-aged man laying under the truck. He ran out the door when I spotted him. Our guess it was a suicide to run him over when we got a call but who knows. This is a few weeks after another incident when I heard screaming outside the station. I get up about midnight to look outside the door when somebody covered in blood smashes into the glass door screaming. Said he was being stabbed. It was him stabbing himself because of drugs.  |-| 
|-| co0v8cy || 157 || Worked at a group home for severely emotionally disturbed kids. I worked the graveyard shift and we were in the middle of the country. One night I was sitting at my desk, looked out the window and thought I saw something moving around. I went up to the window and I was face to face with a bear. It was on it's hind legs and it just kind of sauntered off. Not that creepy, but definitely startling.  |-| 
|-| co0umk5 || 157 || I was Working at night in a mental hospital replacing the hospitals electrical service. Went down in a 20 ft deep man hole and the walls were covered in muddy handprints like someone was trying to crawl there way out. I had to work in there for a few hours and they creeped me out every time I looked at them  |-| 
|-| co0v7zs || 227 || I had a male customer who would come in the store to buy a can of Dr Pepper and a pack of menthol cigarettes every night. He would tell me about his night at work. He worked at a porn theatre. 

He would sigh and say "Busy night tonight. Lots of napkins. But what can I say..." Then grin at me and say, "I *love* my job."

I'd awkwardly say, "Um, that's cool I guess."

Then he'd say, "Well, I'll be thinking about you when I go to sleep tonight."

EVERY. NIGHT. 

SAME CONVERSATION, SAME DR PEPPER, SAME MENTHOL CIGARETTES.

EVERY. DAMN. NIGHT.

And not that it matters, but I'm a 6'3" 240 lb dude.

Tl;dr:  a jizzmopper was in love with me and visited me every night for over a year. |-| 
|-| co0xoef || 203 || Was working at an alternate assignment on night shift. I was not at my office, but at a shared station inside a secure facility. The company has a voice operated 'receptionist' that will direct outside callers to the appropriate extension. This extension is *not* part of that system as nobody 'owns' it. Anyone calling for me would have been directed to my empty office. 

About 1-2 am, my phone rings. The call display is....very strange. The number is not a valid internal number. It is not a valid external number. It, along with the name, is a series of broken characters and bits of illuminated seven-segment display. Complete nonsense. Whatever.  Phone system probably shit the bed and sent corrupted caller ID data. 

So I answered the phone. 

Nothing.  Silence.  Until it began. 

The Ghostbusters theme. In its entirety.

Then silence. 

I have absolutely no idea.  |-| 
|-| co0wnpj || 77 || I work in a busy ER and the one night we had an elderly man (in his 80s) come in with a confirmed MI (heart attack). He died in the room but we revived him, he went to the cath lab and got stented, died again during the procedure but was resuscitated yet again. Then on the way up to his room he died a third time - he didn't make it back after that. The room he started in in the ER was empty and the call bell went off right before they announced the code blue. Nobody had been in that room since him - we reserve it for traumas and urgent cardiac situations. The call bell went off three times that night when nobody else was in there. The same number of times he died. It was just.. creepy.  |-| 
|-| co0ne13 || 107 || I don't work with customers during my shift so I don't have any exciting late night encounters. My bf used to work a drive through at night and he had a woman try to run down the building with her car when he told her that she had ordered more sugar for her coffee than would fit in the cup when the coffee was added. She wanted a small coffee with something like 20 sugars. 19 sugars filled the cup to the top. |-| 
|-| co0y89s || 132 || Used to take smoke breaks on the graveyard shift. I'd smell something really good and get hungry. 

Found out later there was a crematorium nearby and I'm a closet cannibal. |-| 
|-| co0yxq9 || 37 || I'm late but whatever.  A few years ago I worked the overnight shift at a lowbudget hotel in the middle of know where. I grew up in a busy city so this country setting was already super creepy to me, the thought of being alone in the middle of nowhere is very unnerving. Anyway,  one night I get a caller wanting to book several tooms and inevitably asked a bunch of questions about the hotel and amenities.  Every other question he would drop a random "you sound very attractive" or "I can't believe they have you working the graveyard" ect ect. Finally I was like, as nice as possible, "are you going to book the room or what" to which he scoffed and hung up.

Whatever.

The guy ends up calling every night I work for a week, each time trying to pretend to be someone else be he knew I knew and he had some weird excitment in his voice. After the third time I tell my boss, he gets the police involved and they set up some elaborate call tracking system. 

Suddenly creepmaster 5000 stops calling for a few weeks and everything is back to its normal boring self. Train engineers and prostitutes. Suddenly one night I get the call. The guy doesn't even do his regular "oh I'd like to book some rooms" bit but instead tells me he's going to be seeing me really fucking soon. I'm mildly bitchy, so I was simply was like "yeah dude, sure." confident that the patrolling police officer would be nearby. 

About two hours later I'm dicking around on the internet and look up at see a leering short guy about my age just eye fucking me from the otherside of the counter.

I didn't hear him come in and I jusy yelled "oh shit!" before he snickered and bolted out of the lobby and back to his car. He was so creepy looking, akin to Elijah Wood's character from Sin City.

It was a small town and I had never seen the guy before. I called the cops amd they reviewed the tape and couldn't get his plate. I stopped working graveyard after that and never had a call from him again.

Creepmaster 5000 still rides. |-| 
|-| co0xqbv || 71 || I used to work over night shifts at 7-11 ironically from (11-7) One night I was putting things away in the walk in Fridge (smoking a bowl) and this drunk guy comes in. It's passed 2am so I can't sell him booze. I walk out of the fridge and watch him grab a 12 pack of beer. "I can't sell that to you sir, its illegal. (He laughed) (showed me the gun on his waist band) I put my hands up immediately. " Calm down kid. I'm on the job " (motions to his police badge) (Puts 20 on the counter) "Ring it up tomorrow" (leaves) The next day I put in my two weeks. |-| 
|-| co0uz0j || 64 || I was working as a nightwatchman at an apartment building in Melbourne when a police car chase ended right outside my building at 0530. The cops were busting out the drivers side window when the passenger got out and made a run for it ... in my direction. Arrested her and handed her over to the cops.

I found out later she was 15. This was her first car chase. They grow up so fast! |-| 
|-| co0y94h || 64 || Overnights shift here at an IBM datacenter. Our Server rooms are above an old police station. There are access tunnels underneath those for the water company. Our server rooms and the adjoining ones are locked with 2-way keycard access on the 2cnd floor. The Police station was abandoned and sold about 15 years ago when we began construction on the datacenter at the time. We had a thing for freaking out the new guys and taking them down into there. Totally empty open spaces where rows of cubicles and desks used to be. We always created rumors about the homeless staying in there and using it as a drug haven. We hired a new guy, took him downstairs after a few weeks of getting to know him and what not. Exploring, with our phones and having a creepy time. Until I opened an office door and locked eyes with a doped up hobo. I slammed the door and bolted grabbing the new guy by the arm. We rounded a corner and hid in an open door office where they had stashed all the remaining shit i guess. We watched the hobo run past with a crowbar before heading to the fire escape doors we took to get down. That was the scariest shit for me. 0/10 will not ever do again... also it was trespassing...  |-| 
|-| co0qhl8 || 118 || Lol, ok, me again. 
   I've worked a lot of graveyard shifts in my life. 

I used to clean a large city hall, with a group of friends (there were 3 of us). 

I was young, and still overly afraid of stuff, but certain offices in that building just scared the shit out of me. 
   When upstairs, I had to walk right by these offices, to get to the stairs and elevator, and the hair on my neck always stood up, and goose bumps all over. 

Anyhow, what led us to quit...one night, whenever we would enter a different section / office, ( every set of offices had its own keys, locked doors, phones, etc. 
   
We'd unlock the doors, turn on the lights, and the phone closest to us would start ringing. 
   
The phones looked similar to this one https://img1.etsystatic.com/017/0/8591570/il_fullxfull.556122617_i0pd.jpg 

Each phone had its own line, and several other extensions. 
When the phone rang, it showed a blinking light...its own number...and a solid light...a nearby extension. 

One phone in the office, nearby, was calling the phone closest to us. 
   It happened the rest of that night, and for a couple more nights before we quit. 
   It happened in every single office or office section we went into, whether it was room full of cubicles and desks, or a single office. 
   
When I would pick up the phone, It would hang up...go to dial tone. 

If we were braver, we would've looked for which phone was calling the phone closest to us, but it scared the hell out of us, and our nerves were on end while we were there, and then we quit.

|-| co0xh4f || 33 || I use to clean 2 teir passenger trains. My coworker once told me while cleaning the top level of a car, she heard a child whimpering down the hall from her. She thought that a child was left behind and was crying in-between the seats. She slowly walked towards the child trying to comfort him/her. Saying stuff like "its gonna be ok wee one we'll get you home"...By the time she got to the end of the hallway there was no one there and she could no longer hear the whimpering... |-| 
|-| co0t7aq || 63 || I used to deliver the morning paper in a troublesome area of town. One night, as I entered one of the apartment complexes, this dude ran up to me with a hockey stick in his hands, demanding to know what the fuck I thought I was doing. After telling him that I was just delivering the paper he apologized and left. 

Another time I heard someone break into a storage unit by one apartment complex. Whoever it was apparently heard me as well because he stopped what he was doing. I noped the fuck out of there. 

Edit : Words |-| 
|-| co0w0tz || 86 || I'm a firefighter. 
One day we got a call at 3am for a CO alarm by an old woman who was a frequent flyer. 
We get there and she's just sitting up on the couch watching TV (apparently this is normal for her to be up this late.) So my two partners decide to look at the CO alarm and replace the batteries while I go outside and start up the Air monitor. I get it set up and walk in the house and my lt. Walks with me as we monitor the air. As we walk around we see a bunch of pictures  of her deceased husband (he wasn't there, so I'm guessing, I went in every room.) and we get to the kitchen. In the kitchen the stairs to the basement started there, and across from that opening was a door to the back yard. Now she lived in the country, so not many people were around her. So I continue monitoring and I go to the door to the backyard thinking it may be another room to check and I look in the doors window when it just makes this loud slamming noise (like someone punched it) but no one was there. Just an empty field. My Lt. Heard this and was like what the fuck, did the door just slam at you? I said yeah, so being the rookie, he said I can go in the basement by myself to check the air, and he'll meet up with my other partner talking to the lady. The basement was a Michigan basement and it was creepy as shit. Only had one light and a ton of antiques. So I zoomer through cause I was creeped out and went up to report there was no CO and we advised her to buy new alarms. I then asked if she had any dogs (maybe I didn't see it jump on the door) and she said no,  why? I told her and she just calmly said "oh, that's Eugene, he's a ghost and moves stuff around and does things like that. I'm use to it." 
Never figured out anything else. Haven't been back, but that certainly was interesting. 
Sorry I'm on mobile and my phone is being a piece of shit, so sorry for spelling errors or grammar.  |-|

|-| co0vkej || 52 || I worked night shift for a while at a precast concrete manufacturing plant and we would leave the bay doors open during the summer to help get a cross breeze. There was a horse ranch across the street with no security lights so you couldn't see anything on the property but we could hear the horses freaking out as coyotes were sneaking around the property at night. The noises the coyotes made to startle the horses in an attempt to get them to jump the fences were pretty creepy.  |-| 
|-| co0n1gp || 144 || The grocery store I work at used to be open 24 hours. 
 
We had this one guy who would shop at night, he seemed like he was ocd, and other kinds of crazy. 
 
He would straighten out and organize the greetings cards and kool-aid packets while shopping. 
 
One time I found him on the chip aisle, rolling around on the floor and crying. 
 
Another time he was picking out a bar of cheese, he had most of the bars of cheese lined up next to each other on the floor whilst choosing the one he wanted. 
 
While going through line, he had to scan each item himself, so the cashier wouldn't touch them.  |-| 
|-| co0s0jr || 69 || I worked the night shift on an ambulance for a while. 

One night we got a call to take a mental patient from the ER back to her facility. She had thought she was having a heart attack or something. She was fine as far as I could tell. But a patient we ran into when we dropped her off freaked my the fuck out.

We were at the nurses' station getting some paperwork done when out of the corner of my eye I see someone walk up and squeeze my partner's arm. He said "Hello" very casually so I figured it was a nurse he knew or something. It was 4 or 5 am and I was too tired to care or even really look up. Then she walked around the stretcher and squeezed my arm. Her face still haunts me to this day. 

When I saw "blank stare," I mean there was *not* a person behind it. Imagine the most intense "uncanny valley" feeling you've ever had and it will still pale in comparison to the feeling she gave me. There just wasn't anyone there. Fucking terrifying.

|-| co0zcfu || 23 || Worked night shift at a gym. Walked into the pool area to start scrubbing the pool deck and I see 2 drunk people having sex in the shallow end. Woman was on her back with her legs up in the air and her big ol titties hanging out. The guy was ramming it to her pretty good. They didn't notice me so I stood there for a few minutes watching. Thinking to myself, my god, I have always dreamed of this moment! I grabbed the pool stick and tap the guy on the shoulder. He stops what he is doing and turns his head to look at me. I tell them they need to leave. He asks if he can finish. I say hell no, I don't want to clean floating jizz out of the water.  I almost had to call the cops but thankfully they left without too much of a fight. |-| 
|-| co0px4m || 84 || Obligatory not me, but a few guys at the warehouse I worked at had a series of incidents where an insane homeless man would always try to run through the warehouse at night and steal product. This isn't too scary except for the fact he would scream at them to back up or he'd give them aids from blood on his knife, which the cops confirmed he had due to prior dealings with him. |-| 
|-| co0tyja || 63 || I worked the Remain Over Night (RON) flight for two years at a small airport. Sometimes we would be up until 2 or 3 am waiting for it to come in then clean and search it for the morning flight. Well, one night I'm sealing the aircraft up, shut down the GPU, and then look over at the tree line across the runway. Moving slowly across the runway is what I can only describe as "Murder Fog." It was incredibly thick and there was not a sound to be heard. Creepy as all hell. I wound the cord up and just as it crossed onto my ramp I get inside and just stare out the window. It went from clear starry night to Silent Hill in a matter of five minutes. Weirdest thing I've ever seen.  |-| 
|-| co0wnkw || 23 || I used to work swing shift security for a ski resort.  My shift ended at midnight my bus home was at 12:25 and it was just over a 20 minute walk down the mountain.  The walk is fucking dark too, no streetlights and trees on all sides so its dark even with a full moon.  There was a pack of coyote that would follow me down the mountain from time to time.  One coyote will leave you alone but three or four will follow you and "talk" amongst themselves, presumably whether or not they could take me if they tried.  They were bold, they would get 20 or so feet away from me at times.  The worst was when they would start howling.  Imagine you are walking down a dark mountain path, you can see the eye shine in the trees with your flashlight, then this starts.  http://youtu.be/YtsZoIe3Czk |-| 
|-| co0zr3d || 23 || I used to work graveyard shift managing a hotel. Usually I was the only employee on premises during this shift and because it was a nice hotel with mostly regular guests, I usually felt very comfortable.  One night when I ran the night audit I realized that the person working the shift before me let a man check into the hotel even though his credit card was declined. Normally that would be fine, we would just have to take a cash deposit in lieu of a credit card, but the person working before me failed to do so. It was about 1:00 AM and I needed to get a valid form of payment from the guest so I called his room and asked him to come downstairs with either a valid credit card or cash. He came downstairs and told me he gave his credit card already and that even though it was declined that didn't matter. I explained again that it was declined, so not valid, and that he can either give another credit card or a cash deposit or he would need to leave. This conversation went in circles and I was becoming extremely frustrated. He started raising his voice at me and then threatened to rape me. I'm a short, petite girl in my 20's and this guy was tall and looked quite overpowering physically. He could easily have jumped over the counter. As soon as he threatened me, I ran into the back office, locked the door and called the police. They arrived quickly and I explained the situation and one of the officers escorted him to his room to get his belongings and then they made him leave. One of the officers stayed in the parking lot until my shift was over incase he tried to come back.  |-| 
|-| co0ztfw || 23 || Not necessarily creepy, but I still have nightmares about it, so what the hell. 

Reeeeeaaallllyy long story, but it's pretty intense and disgusting. I used to be an EMT. Worked 24 hour shifts, which had it's perks (slow days where you literally got paid to sleep or eat or read, 4 days off every week, etc.). It also had it's downside. Getting out of bed to run a call at 1am or 3am sucks. Being sleep deprived sucks. Getting calls that are WAY outside your scope of practice sucks. One time, I got the perfect combination of these 3 situations. 

I had run call after call after with no downtime from sometime in the early morning to about 1am. Just one if those really rare, super crazy days. Got back to the station, fell asleep immediately. 2am rolls around, I'm paged for a call at a nursing home a bit down the road for "Trouble breathing - Emesis" (NOTE: Emesis is a fancy word for puke). I'm so loopy from lack of sleep, I don't really mentally prepare for a call of that nature - truthfully, I'm thinking either a Nurse at the facility or the Paramedics with the Fire Department will get to the call before my partner and I (EMT's are bottom of the food chain in the county). I'm really expecting to walk in and find an elderly person a bit under the weather, and mayyyybbee take them to the hospital if the staff or the patient thinks it's that serious.

Anyway, I hop in the rig and we head over to the nursing home. We go through the motions of unloading the gurney, checking for a room number, etc. I head down the hall and walk into to the room just in time to see an elderly man (maybe 80's or 90's) sit straight up his bed and EXPLODE BLACK, GREASY VOMIT all over the room. Not like one heave either, this guy is spraying this shit everywhere. I was so caught off guard, it took me a second to even react and get to him. As I'm trying to assist the guy (suction the shit out of his mouth so he can breathe, get him on his side so he doesn't choke, etc.) the Black Death is getting on my face, down my shirt... Everywhere. He's fucking panicking, grabbing my arms and making the worst noises I've ever heard. It was fucking chaos. 

"Coffee ground Emesis" occurs when a patient has a lower gastrointestinal bleed, and the red color (I think the heme?) has been digested by acid in the GI tract. This is a 9-1-1, lights and sirens, "this shit is for real" call, and the nursing home has called an independent, BASIC LIFE SUPPORT EMT-Company to handle it. Due to local scope of practice, I cannot push drugs, I cannot intubate, etc. I am a janitor trying to keep a dying man afloat. 

Amidst everything, I honestly remember stopping for a few seconds and just staring at my partner and waiting to wake up because there's no fucking way that any of it could actually be happening. Honestly, thinking I was having a nightmare because of all the craziness of such a busy day. Unfortunately, I was not asleep. 

Just as the guy totally fell out, the fire department came and took over. Due to patient confidentiality, I couldn't ever ask what the end result was, but I think I know how it ended. 

TLDR: [This.](http://media.giphy.com/media/UHFy9vfExuKoo/giphy.gif) |-| 
|-| co0w4p3 || 43 || Seen plenty of horrible shit people can do, but I figure I should go for the less explainable.

I worked overnights for a hotel and there would sometimes be weird shit that happened. The front desk phone would ring from rooms that were supposed to be unoccupied, or from the gym or pool rooms.

The elevator would work on it's own. For a while I thought it was kids playing around, but I eventually reviewed security camera footage when it happened and there was no one.

There would also be weird sounds and the occasional movement on camera where people shouldn't have been able to get into.

I was told that the owners suspected the contractors of doing a shit job on the wiring which cause a lot of the weird issues. Also the security cameras were crap so who knows what caused whatever looked like movement.

Still pretty creepy experiences. I also have a lot of stories of creepy overnight customers from this job and others, but this was probably the ones that creeped me out the most. |-| 
|-| co0ynet || 41 || I work at an assisted living facility where its very common for residents to see a little girl before they die. The caregivers will go in to check on them and the resident will ask them "Why does that little girl come in with you and stare at me?". 
 I've gotten complaints from residents about how they're fed up with the kids that play in their apartment and when the residents try and catch the kids, the kids disappear.  |-| 
|-| co0z2lv || 20 || I worked  the 11-7 shift at a retirement home for affluent people who were pretty much self sufficient.  The building was brand new and had about 10 people in the whole place (around 75 apartments), and it was stacked.  full cinema, pool, hot tub, big gym, wicked kitchen, etc, and my boss said I could use whatever facilities I wanted (kitchen included) after I had finished my "work" (which was about 3-4 hours of shit). So I've finished all my work and I've swam or worked out or whatever I choose to do that night.  It's around 3:30-4AM and I'm sitting in the lobby zoned out on some website, and this sunken face of death comes around the corner in front of me.  I mean, Skeletor had nothing on this gaunt creature that stood before me. Of course, she was a new resident in the building but I didn't know that, and I was fucking sure that she was a ghost/demon/there to steal my soul.  So sure was I that I could neither move nor speak; I was completely paralyzed with fear.  She walked right up to me and asked if I knew where there was some tea she could have. I started cry-laughing with relief. I have never been happier to make someone a cup of tea.  |-| 
|-| co0rkov || 54 || I worked at a warehouse midnight to 7 am for almost two years. It was out in the middle of f*cking nowhere, right across the road from a pretty big river. Lot's of homeless guys and redneck's hanging out for the night.. for about a week straight I would hear blood curdling female screams from somewhere beyond the parking lot lights. Needless to say I nor my co-workers ever investigated. |-| 
|-| co0z0hz || 20 || I used to work nights at the hospital in the distribution warehouse. The warehouse is located in the basement next to the morgue (so the best possible place). I was in the warehouse getting supplies to take to the ER and all of a sudden I here a record player turn on and it's playing some old country western type music. I found the source of the noise and its coming from behind a locked door. The locked door leads to a small boiler room. There is only one entrance to that room and I am the only one in that warehouse. I take the supplies and promptly leave. It still gives me cold chills just thinking about it.  |-| 
|-| co0w91e || 28 || TL;DR- sexual acts in the parking lots and a middle aged special needs woman beats the crap out of her mom while dad yells at mom. 

Worked as a security guard at an outlet mall in north Georgia. Most stuff happens in the parking lot. I've caught teens having sex, saw a guy getting a BJ from another dude, grandpa jacking it in his truck, homeless dude getting into the clothing donation bin, but the oddest was a family who was traveling back home stopped in the parking lot just after I showed up ~10 PM. I was walking around checking the locks on stores when I saw them pull in. I went and grabbed  our company truck to go see what happening. As I pull around the corner I can see that an older woman is getting a beat down from another woman. I'm talking serious blows to the head an I can see chunks of hair being pulled out. I radioed the sheriffs department ( the outlet is a big $ maker for taxes so we get a radio directly to the station) and let them know what's going on. As I get out of the truck a brawny older gentleman steps out of the van and is yelling to stop and break it up. He steps I between the two and then begins to give the older woman verbal lashing worse that the physical one she just got. An officer shows up and starts asking questions. Turns out the older man and woman are husband and wife and the woman who was giving the beat down was their mentally handicapped daughter who got upset at her mother over some food they just got. The shitty part was how the husband just kept baratting his wife and telling her how she was a fuck up. Eventually an ambulance took the mother away and the father left with his daughter.  |-| 
|-| co0ydwm || 13 || Working at a warehouse from 10PM till 8AM. During June and July when it was really hot and humid, we would open the over head doors during our lunch and hope there would be a nice breeze. One night with 2 of my coworkers, we open the over head door, sit on the ledge and start chatting. Then we look out in the yard and we see a guy walking around without his vest on about 50 yards away. We yell to him "Hey where's your fucking vest!?" just as a joke. The guys in the yard know us pretty well as it is. The man keeps walking and doesn't acknowledge us. Then the man stops, and we can barely see him now. He's not near one of the lights. All we can really see is that he's looking around. A few moments of him standing still and he starts walking towards the building. One of us yells out "Hey, you really need your vest on, these guys might have a hard time seeing you". Then we hear the man scream something. It wasn't any words though, just him screaming for a moment. At this point he's about 20 yards or so away and we can see him pretty clear, and he's not wearing any sort of uniform for a yard worker. So we radio into our inbound/outbound coordinators, and tell them there's a guy in the yard and he seems to be in some kind of trouble. The man stops again and yells. All 3 of us who could see him decide to go out there and see what this guys problem is. So we walk over to the door, walk down the stairs that lead to the yard and he's not there anymore. We go back inside and radio in that we don't see the guy anymore. 

10 minutes later we hear over the radio that there's a guy banging on one of the trailers on the other side of the building. They call the cops at this point and we just wait around. We're all guessing at what this guy is doing, we assume that maybe it's just a guy who was drunk, or maybe it was this guy who was recently fired. Over the radio they tell all the yard workers and drivers to not go in the yard, or to approach this man. Then they said "If you're in a truck, lock your doors and turn off any lights". My 2 coworkers and I start thinking that this might be some serious shit. So we close the overhead door that we were sitting at, and go towards the yard office. We ask them what's going on, and they tell us that whoever this guy is just tried breaking into one of the trucks and he's bleeding. There was blood smeared on the driver side door of a truck. 

The police arrive and start scouting the yard looking for this guy. They find him, arrest him, and that was pretty much it. 

He was on what they assumed to be meth and kind of prescription. The blood was from him trying to break into a trailer, he cut his hand while trying to open the latch. He had ditched his car at the Target parking lot that was a few blocks away. This also wasn't his first time doing something like this. A few months before this he tried breaking into his girlfriends house to get drugs, and he also bit a cop a few years before that.  |-| 
|-| co10cjx || 14 || I watched a homeless person argue with a creek. |-| 
|-| co0wg9u || 27 || I work with commercial farmers, scheduling them to come in with their product (berries, corn, etc.) so they can be canned and bagged and sent out. One night our scheduled corn grower wasn't getting his trucks in on time, so I had to go and check it out. Turns out a body was dumped in the middle of their field and they needed to sort it out with the police. That was an interesting change of pace to an incredibly boring job. |-| 
|-| co0r9ok || 36 || walking to work at 5 am I came across a deer that had been attacked and dragged by what I later found out was a cougar.   |-| 
|-| co0ynpj || 12 || I used to work third shift at a diner. Mostly it was just crazy people stealing jelly/butter, but we had the occasional weirdo. This one guy that would just hand me a wad of cash and have me order for him, or get pork chops and tip fat. But he would get irrationally angry at anyone he perceived to be a threat to me. Or the lady that put her wig on my head and then tried to braid my hair. I let it happen. Or the guy that used to come in wearing chaps and a rubber dog mask. He was nice enough, but way too happy. Oh! Or the guy that threatened to shoot up the place cause he didn't want cheese on his sandwich or something. |-| 
|-| co0zs7x || 12 || I worked a gas station in a small town (1,000) that was located along a major trucking/travel route.  
I saw a bunch of tweakers, drunks, etc.  
Oddly, there was also a lot of crime. I once had the cops roll up to question a fairly suspicious fellow. Who wound up getting arrested for the burglary tools in his pocket and plenty of stolen property.  
I had bikers roll through and give me free meth/valium/weed/cigs for giving them directions.  
I saw a VERY wasted biker go through an automatic car wash.  
Nothing too crazy, but it was an interesting job.  |-| 
|-| co0vy67 || 21 || I used to be a night stocker at a grocery store. I stocked the yogurt. The nice thing about the yogurt is that you pretty much work by yourself and as long as you get done on time the boss doesn't bother you.
So, I'm stocking the yogurt one night and I'm bent over filling the bottom shelf. Now keep in mind I haven't seen anyone in literally hours. 
Suddenly, a hand grabs me by the shoulder.
"Can you help me find something?" Asks a man literally 4 inches from me.
"Uh...uh... Sure." I stammered as I backed up.

Dude, who looked like a prison rapist, scared the crap out of me by grabbing me while stocking grocery shelves  by myself. I'm a 250 lb, 6'2" guy. |-| 
|-| co0zgbb || 20 || I read the title as Graveyard workers of reddit, and have been reading for the past fifteen minutes wondering where all of the graveyard stories were. |-| 
|-| co0s8n4 || 92 || I've worked in four hotels and inns, and three of them had staffs (even management!) that insisted the places were haunted. 

A lot of places do that. It gives you a convenient thing to blame when things go screwy, and a fun story to tell the guests. But some people take it WAY too seriously.

I don't believe in ghosts, so that meant I got to do all the 'weird stuff'. One of the outbuildings was used as a bridal-party's changing room, so I had to go out there (because nobody else would) to fetch someone's understuff. Came back, all "O^oooOo! ^ Haunted Braaaa!". They said it was unprofessional. I say they started it, sending me to the Spectral Changing Room.

Another time, one of the sales department was working overnight with me. She said  "I dropped my keys at one end of the hallway, and I heard the sounds of keys dropping *from the other end of the hallway*!". And I'm silently screaming "It's... called... an *echo*." |-| 
|-| co0wbos || 19 || Part of my shift involves roving patrols so I like to mix it up and go down some trails behind the plant I work at in our truck. Before Katrina there was a really nice old southern style mansion on the property behind our plant. Now all that is left is a brick fireplace. Just a brick fireplace surrounded my oak trees with moss hanging every where. It's creepy as hell. There is also a Native American burial mound further back. I can only get out there during the summer as most of the land is pretty much always flooded. |-| 
|-| co0syj2 || 33 || My mother is a nurse and she used to work the overnight shifts at a mental hospital. This night, her and her Dave were working the wing with the really far gone patients who would be locked into their rooms for the night. They were doing rounds to make sure everyone was okay and in their rooms and as she was checking to common room, her radio goes off and it's Dave telling her that one of the problem patients was loose and to stay put until he got to her. She was almost a football field away from him at the other side of the wing, so she barricaded the door with the couches and tables. Thankfully she made it out unharmed. |-| 
|-| co11ks2 || 10 || I used to work night shift in a mall 11-6am. 1 mill sqf mall and there were 3 of us plus a security guard all night. 

Apparently the mall opened in the 50s and at that point only employed 1 security guard named Howard (started out as only a Sears and a few other stores)who worked there for close to 40 years. The story, which is confirmed by some of the mall office employees that still work there from when he died is that he loved his job/the mall so much he requested to be buried in his uniform. And was. 

Now the creepy part is that the security guards have told us that many times when contractors or other people have been working in the building at night they've seen a security guard walking through the mall, like far up a hallway, and waved to them but had no response,  then when they go to the security office to sign out asked the on duty guard why they didn't wave back or what they were up to....and the guard(s) have been sitting in the office the whole night.

I could tell stories about all the creepy creepy underground cement hallways under this mall, like miles of corridors to underground loading bays and utility rooms that cross the whole place... that are so deep and quiet no one else would ever ever hear you scream... but there is one hallway behind the sport check that you can only access through a freight elevator into the basement. I don't even know where it ends because it was way too creepy, but there's a pop machine at the bottom by the elevator. No one can ever get off the elevator at night by themselves. There's something so fuck in dark and creepy in that hallway by yourself that you just can't leave the elevator.  Because when the doors close they take a good 30sec to reopen. This one night shift employee Sam was a pretty big guy, and was new and hadn't heard anything about the creepy shit at the mall yet. He went off at lunch 2 am to get a pop and heads to the back hallway where our office was (we all thought he was going to the office) which connects to this sport check hallway. He comes back about 15 mins later (takes a while to cross a mall that big) and he's completely white and walking really fast. He says he went down to the basement to get a pop from the machine and when he walked out of the elevator to the machine the doors closed and he felt something behind him, "something really fucking terrible" and he stopped and turned around to reopen the door.... it's one of those freight elevators you have to hold the button in while the doors open or they close automatically again if you let go. He said he just held the button and waited for it to open while he felt something still behind him "was really angry and wanted him to leave" he said that 30sec before the doors opened was the scariest moments of his life.... He quite the next night. I've never seen someone so scared.

I've personally seem weird shit. Like mopping infront of a Jean Machine store at 4 am and watched a pair of pants on a hanger fall off a rack. Like the whole hanger. 6 feet infront of me, on the other side of a steel security gate. A hanger that sat perfectly still since closing at 9pm fell off a rack with nothing touching it....it creeped me the fuck out...

Another time I was driving a floor scrubbing machine past a H&amp;M and right as I passed the big glass windows I heard a really loud knocking, like someone knocking on a door trying to wake someone up loud. Of course I instantly turned my head and there was nothing there except a dark empty store. I 100% heard the distinct sound of someone knocking on a glass window right beside me. I jumped off the machine

Another employee Reg has watched an entire shelf of chocolate boxes fall off a shelf inside a store through the gate. Like 10 or so square boxes just rolling off a shelf. He even called security and they confirmed the store was locked. Alarm was on. And all the boxes were laying on the ground below the shelf.


Edit: I know this is long, but I'll add that this mall now also has a bar that is popular for the local university students. And at 2 am on my lunches I'd go watch the drunks leave and get rowdy etc... aka hot chick's.  The bar had to have a police car stationed every Thursday night because that was their student night and was extra crazy. The mall also put on an extra guard or two those nights. I'd put my cbradio onto the security channel and listen to the drama.
The best was on Halloween hearing security's calls:  "can you drive the security truck past the east back lot, Batman and Robin are drunk and trying to climb the fence"  "the drunk snowhite just got back into the bar again, can you notify the bouncers" "there is a tiger puking by entrance 5"   |-| 
|-| co12qkn || 9 || A friend of mine helped me get the job at this company. We both worked swing shift so we would carpool.

Normally we would get off work at 11pm, but some days we worked overtime. This particular night we worked until 1am. It was my turn to drive so I dropped my buddy off at his place then headed home to mine. About 5 miles down the road I came across a car that was crashed in the ditch. The lights were still on so I assumed it must have just happened. I pulled over to see if they needed help.

When I got out of the car I saw a guy sitting on the ground next to the crashed car. He was holding his arm which was bleeding. I called out to him and asked if he was okay. He said he was. He stood up and came over to me. I could see he had a pretty bad cut on his arm and another on his forehead. I asked if he wanted me to call him an ambulance or to call the police or anything like that. He said no. Help was on the way. I asked if he needed anything or wanted me to stay with him. Before he could answer a phone in his pocket started ringing. He answered and I actually relaxed a little assuming he had called for help already. He then said into the phone, "I'm trying...I know...Okay." He handed the phone to me. I took it assuming it might be the ambulance needing directions or something like that. When I put the phone to my ear the man's voice said, "Hello Sir, give the phone back to my colleague, get back in your shiny white car (I was in a white car) and leave. Don't stop. Don't call anyone. Am I making myself clear?" I said, "Yes." I handed the phone back, wished the guy luck, got in my car and got the hell out of there.

|-| co0y6b3 || 16 || This happened when I was still in nursing school. I had a graveyard shift at a maternity clinic. It was about 4am, I was alone at the pantry at the very back part of the clinic, you know killing time by stuffing food my face. I was preparing to go back to where my classmates were when I heard a "psst" I thought it was one of my classmates so I answered back. When no one spoke, I turned around to get my stuff I saw by the window a little boy facing the window. I should really just GTFO of there but I think it haven't registered on me yet that there is no way someone would get in the clinic at 4am without us seeing and none of the midwives brought their children. So, I started walking towards the boy but when I looked down, I saw he had no feet! He was just floating there and I think that's when it dawned on me he was a ghost. So before he could turn around, the ran the hell out of there. As I was getting to the door, I heard "psst" again. Definitely did not turn around. |-| 
|-| co0w2e7 || 24 || I was in a house in a regular neighborhood working nights. For about a week I had to listen to a goose calling all night for a mate that must have been lost somehow. Incredibly depressing to hear all night long, particularly while alone.

Also once a drunk driver drove into the house and hit the gas line outside. After the "boom!" there was a man banging on the door telling me to evacuate the building. The police arrived after he took off. |-| 
|-| co0yrnf || 8 || I used to work at as the night manager at my university's student union.  My job was to lock the doors around 10pm and then let the cleaning people out/in.  Occasionally I would make rounds of the building to make sure students and homeless people weren't sleeping in any of the rooms.  Other than that there wasn't much to do.  I got a lot of studying and Netflix in.  

One night I'm making rounds and I notice a cop standing outside on the colonnade poking at something with his nightstick.  I shift around and I can see its a freshman passed out drunk on the bench outside.  For some reason he wasn't wearing shoes.  We weren't too far from the dorms so I'd guess he either wandered away or his friends ditched him.  

So anyway, this cop is trying to rouse him.  He gets the kid upright and he *immediately* pukes all over the cop's shoes.  The cop looks pissed, but he lays the kid back down and starts talking into his radio.  Over the next 10 minutes more cops show up, along with paramedics.  I unlocked the doors to let the paramedics cut through the building with the gurney.  Of course, the kid pukes all over the goddamn floor inside the building, so I had to mop that up.  I remember thinking that this was probably going to be the high point of that kid's day considering that he was going to wake up in the hospital and some kind of citation for puking on a cop.   |-| 
|-| co13fxm || 8 || I was on call once (I drive a service truck) for a weekend and had to go all the way from South San Francisco to Sacramento, which is about a 2-2 1/2 hour drive, at midnight. On my way back, now it's about 3AM, I had to stop for fuel because my work truck runs on natural gas, so my fueling locations are limited. Leaving Elk Grove, Google took me on a backwoods route through Isleton, which is a small town on an island in the Sacramento river. Parts of that drive are creepy as fuck at night, because it's a rural highway where some parts are completely canopied by tree growth, leaving you with a scary tunnel vibe. 

I'm driving along at 60 MPH on a pitch black road, my brights were off because another car was coming towards me. I see the other guy swerve into my lane, and back to into his lane. He passes me and then I see him. I'll call him Bubba.

Bubba is just standing in the middle of the road. At 3 AM. On a dark, secluded highway with almost no traffic. Just standing there, in my lane. He's wearing a dirty flannel shirt and some beat up jeans. Couldn't get more *Tucker and Dale VS. Evil* than this guy. I assume he was what the other guy swerved around. I slam on my brakes, because I'm in a 9000 pound service truck on a narrow levee road with steep drops on both sides of me. I stopped about 15 feet in front of him and honk. He looks up at me. I turned my brights on to tell him to keep walking. I flashed a couple times. Still staring. You know that thousand yard stare you see on military honor guard? 

He just keeps standing there. A cop came up behind me, slammed on his brakes, and lit me up, presumably for being stopped in the middle of the goddamn road. I got on my PA to tell the guy to get out of the road. Isleton PD guy hears this, hopefully thinks I'm not just stopped on a highway for no reason. The cop gets out, starts walking over to my passenger side, sees Bubba, and draws his weapon, telling him to get on the ground.

Bubba doesn't comply. Instead, he moves faster than I've ever seen anyone move and bolts into the woods. I mean, *28 Days Later* fast. Cop runs after him, yelling the whole way for him to stop. I pointed my spotlight down the way he was going to try to be helpful. 

After about 45 seconds of "What the fuck just happened?", cop emerges from the woods. I rolled down my passenger window, and he told me to just go ahead up to the next pulloff spot so we can talk. I do, and talking with him, he tells me that guy has been doing that for a couple weeks now, but nobody recognizes him, which is a little odd, considering the population of Isleton is smaller than the amount of kids who I went high school with. Someone even hit him once, but he scampered off. Creepy as fuck.

I have a dashcam now, just because of this. Fuck Bubba. |-| 
|-| co0sogx || 29 || I work overnight at a call centre. We take calls for companies, offices, and stuff like that.

One night I get a lady calling at 3 in the morning, wanting to leave a voicemail in her psychotherapist's voicemail. I explain to her that I am the answering service. The medical office doesn't have a voicemail because they pay a live person (me) to take their messages.

She instantly started bawling, calling me a fucking prick and screeching into the phone. 

Another time I got a call from an old man demanding that I contact his doctor, again at about 3 or 4am. He said he called the police because voices in his head are telling him the police want him. The police told him to speak to his doctor. He also said the voices in his head are telling him his neighbours are talking about him. |-| 
|-| co0vak6 || 17 || I did room service at a hotel we offered it 24/7. I would sometimes see people out of the corner of my eye in the hallways it was creepy. Sometimes it was like they turned a corner and were.gone |-| 
|-| co0y3xm || 7 || I work graveyard shift making snow for a ski resort. Haven't seen anything creepy yet, but I did get to watch a meteor show during a new moon from 11k feet up on the mountain. It was pretty amazing! 

Scariest moment was probably slipping, falling, then uncontrollably sliding down most of a steep run at 3am. I was by myself on that run and if I got knocked out by a tree or something, I'd be laying in snow for a long time before someone would find me.  |-| 
|-| co0v4wt || 19 || At a night shift at a youth correctional facility on the edge of my city, we had a woman and a man come to the door covered in blood. They had just been in a car accident and needed to call the police. Not at all scary in the middle of the night. |-| 
|-| co0wmar || 15 || I used to work overnights at a 24-hour card room and the most weird/depressing thing was seeing the overwhelming amount of people who come in alone at 2 or 3 in the morning to gamble. |-| 
|-| co0xtoy || 13 || Used to deliver papers with my grandmother, she's not as old as you think. We'd have like 350 something papers which was a pretty small route compared to other people.

There's a road in my town (where we'd deliver papers) that was meant for condos/houses, but was spread out to a point, all their mailboxes/paper "tubes" were in one place. The tubes in reality were just wood squares underneath their mailboxes that would just keep them off the ground.

I'd have to get out of the car and individually put all the papers in each of the people's respective areas at 3-4 o'clock in the morning, depending on when the truck would show up to the warehouse in the first place to drop off the papers to deliver.

Pretty dark and wet and muggy outside, I grab the 5 papers I need, walk over, put the papers in 52, 54, 55, 57, and 59.

I hear "Where's mine?"

You know that feeling you get when you cum and your body seizes up in those few seconds?

That, combined with shitting your pants, could make the manliest of men jump.

I turned around, there's no one there. I walked back towards the car, my grandma at the steering wheel, and I heard "HEY I'M TALKING TO YOU!" I looked, and an old guy is just staring at me in a light blue robe. I had no idea where he came from.

I got in the car and we drove away, didn't acknowledge him. We got a complaint later that day because 55 myasshole Terrace didn't have a paper placed in the tube. I know damn well it did. (Myasshole is not an actual road, I replaced it for location purposes)

Next night, we delivered there, he was standing at the mailbox. My grandma goes 

"You live at 55 Myasshole Terrace?" 

"Yeah I want my paper" 

"You got it yesterday, didn't you?"

"You never gave it to me, you just put it in the tube"

"You're getting it in the tube today too"

She threw TOWARDS the tube, it hit the ground, and we drove away. He didn't complain and we never saw him again.

Found out later, he has a nursing aid that was away on vacation that would normally get it for him.

But fuck him, that dude scared me to death. I purposely don't wanna tell this story cause he lives in my town and some of my friends on reddit might actually know who he is. But who gives a shit. |-| 
|-| co0ysuk || 6 || I used to open a gym at 5am.  I would get there at 4:30am and go around turning on lights, counting money, brew coffee, etc.  It was a big place with offices, indoor pool, indoor tennis courts, several buildings, yoga studios, etc.  One morning during my walk through, I turned on the lights for the indoor pool and there was a guy about FIVE FEET away from me in a lounge chair.  It scared the absolute shit out of me, but I didn't make a sound.  Dude was sound asleep.  I turned the lights back off and ran to the front desk and called 911.  Cops show up and so does my manager.  Turns out the guy was actually an employee about 10 years ago and had a big drinking problem.  The best part was watching the surveillance videos later that day.  The guy would go up to the bar in the restaurant and fill up two glasses of beer and then just go chill by the pool and drink.  He went back and forth about 5 times before passing out. |-| 
|-| co0z09o || 6 || One summer I worked nights in an Amazon warehouse stocking product into the storage bays.  The warehouses were so big no security cameras were installed, so workers would take fleshlights (you'd be surprised how many of these would pass through the warehouses each week) into the bathrooms, use them, and restock them into the storage bays to be redistributed to consumers.  |-| 
|-| co107bu || 6 || I caught a guy breaking into a car around three in the morning. He took off and I watched as he launched himself out of the third story of a parking garage. The garage was built on the side of a hill, so one one side you can enter on the second story. He chose the wrong side and fell thirty feet to the pavement. He was still able to hobble of the property while I watched from the third floor and called the cops.

I had a half frozen bum try to fight me when I rousted him from an underground parking garage.

A ton of hot chicks peeing in between cars after the bars had let out.

Parking lot sex... |-| 
|-| co12urj || 7 || Former Air Force here.  I was a munitions systems technician, and I worked in a very large storage facility (called a *bomb dump*) in Europe.  This place had dozens of buildings, including many earth-covered magazines (called *igloos*) housing thousands of bombs.  This facility was pretty big.  It was about nine square miles I think.

An interesting thing about this bomb dump was that it was completely forested, and populated with wildlife.  Most are deforested because of the fire hazard, but the country that this bomb dump was in required that the area be maintained as a natural preserve.

Now, despite having a small deer population, this forest wasn't nice and clear.  Most forests have a fire or two to clear them out every 20 years or so.  This forest had played host to munitions storage since WWII, and had no fires since.  It was thick, dark, and dank.  The trees were so overgrown that you would be hard pressed to see 10 yards in a straight line.  Anyway, it was a pretty creepy place at night... hell, it was pretty creepy in the daytime.

Twice a day, we had to run a security check to make sure that no holes had been cut through the fence, and all of the buildings were closed and locked.  However, this wasn't the job of the swing shifters.  We were a skeleton crew.  The checks were ran by the morning and afternoon crews... unless of course they fucked up...

... which they did one afternoon.

The one guy in *Control* doesn't realize that no PM security check was ran until about 1:00am.  Since no one is working dispatch, he just walks down the hall to our office and asks us to run it.  We had finished all of our work early, so we were playing split-screen Halo (which was the new at the time).  Me and my friend Brian volunteered to take a truck out and run the check.  We grabbed a walkie talkie and a flashlight and headed out.


First we run the perimeter, its about an 11 or 12 mile trip, but we have to go about 15mph tops so it takes quite a while.  When we started building checks it was about 2:00am.  We began at the back – I can't remember how it went now, but we had an efficient system for checking every building without having to double back... anyway, we started as far back from our building and coworkers as possible.

Well, Brian decides that a piss and a cigarette are in order before we begin the building check, which would take us another hour or so.  He shuts the truck off, drops the tailgate and we just sit and chill in utter darkness while he burns down his cig.  To this day, I don't know why he shut that ignition off.

When we hopped back in and tried to start the truck again nothing happened.  The ignition simply didn't fire.  No attempted turn over.  No sputter and fail.  Just silence.  It must have been an electrical problem.


*"Well fuck."*  We both thought it and said it simultaneously.


*"Control, this is storage one.  We're broke down out here."*


*Silence.*


*"Control, we're out past building 70.  We need a ride.  You copy?"*


*Silence.*


We tried the walkie talkie for a good 15 minutes before we realized that we would be walking back.


Now, we could have stuck to the road.  There were no streetlights, but at least we would know where we were going.  We would have had to walk about a a mile northward to the main corridor, and the turn east for another three miles.  Not too bad... but for some reason we thought it would be much faster to take a shortcut through the forest.


I actually knew this was a shitty idea... but I had a man card to preserve, so I went along with the idea.  No matter what logical idea I came up with for sticking to the road, it always sounded like *"I'm a giant pussy"* when I said it in my head.  So I trudged out into the woods with Brian.


You'd think that Brian had balls of steel.  You'd think that he would shrug of any *spooky* shit just to save some face.  This was all his testosterone laden idea anyway after all.  Well, this wasn't so.


Brian was scared shitless about 10 minutes in.  Now, I wasn't too scared.  I knew it was a bad idea, but I wasn't about to lose it or anything.  However, Brian's anxiety was strong and I could sense it, and worse of all it was getting increasingly contagious.


Walking through thick woods is slow.  Neither of us had watches on, and our cell phones were back in our lockers.  Before we just went off of the clock in the truck, but that truck was a quarter mile away now.  So we had no real idea what time it was.  But we were too far into the woods to go back.


I knew that we were'n going in straight line.  We were meandering about, but I did know that we *should have* almost been to one of the rows of buildings.


It was probably only about 20 minutes since we had left the truck, but it might as well have been hours, when we reached the row of buildings.  These were old buildings, above ground brick structures, not the concrete igloos.  The above-ground magazines had specially designed roofs that would blow upwards in the event of a catastrophic explosion, minimizing damage to nearby structures.  They were also some of the oldest buildings in the bomb dump, little newer than WWII itself.  They were ram-shacked, rusted, and coated in moss.  Inside they were dank and moldy.  The only thing we kept in them were plain MK82 bomb bodies.  The least expensive, and least sensitive stock that we had.  The only saving grace about these buildings was a the dim industrial lights over their doorways.  While not ideal, the soft orange glow was a welcome break from our flashlight.


We started walking down the gravel road that these buildings lined.  We passed one.  Then another, and another.  Then...


*"Holy fucking shit, Joe."*


One of the buildings was open!  The big steel blast doors were sealed, but the side door for personnel to use was propped open with a fucking rock.



*"Uh... Control.  This is storage one. Um... Building 62 is not secure."*


*Silence.*


*"Did you get that Control?  Building 62 is open."*


*Silence.*


I looked at Brian.  *"You know, we have to check this out right?"*


Though it was too dark to tell, I'm pretty sure Brian wen't a little pale.  *"Yep."*


We approached the door like Osama Bin Laden was going to jump out with a fucking scimitar and gut us... after all, we didn't have weapons on us.  I stuck my head in.


*"Hello?"*


I felt a chill roll over me as I entered.  Brian followed.  It stunk in the building.  It smelled like wet concrete and mildew.  I shined the flashlight down a row of bombs.  There were hundreds in there.


When I was satisfied we headed back to the doorway.  We didn't have the keys to lock it up, but at least we could say that it was secure...


That's when I heard it.  *The most blood-curddling scream I had ever heard.*


My heart went into my fucking throat.


Brian just ran.  I just followed him.  We ran all the way out of the building, across the road, and into the trees across.


*"What the fuck!"*  Brian was shaking.  I'm pretty sure that I was too.

ER Veterinarian here. 2am a young ex - marine brings his sick cat. Pleasant young man, some scars on his head from trauma, and went into a cool story of how it happened and what he was doing in recovery currently. He had a gun in his holster, and in the middle of our conversation he brought it out and started waving it around playing with the cat with the laser pointer. 

Me thinks: oh what a cool laser toy in the form of a gun.

Afterwards my nurse comes out pale white saying that is definately a real gun, and if he had been inclined to do so we would have all died.

|-| co0ztnz || 5 || I work the late shift at a taco place (open until 1 AM). Guy comes through the drive through with his gf and obviously has no idea what he's doing. We have to help him through the menu (not that uncommon). His order is pretty small, so I make it in a couple minutes and go to hand it out to him, just to find him lighting up a fresh bowl right at the window. This window, mind you, can see right into the kitchen where I'm making his order, so it's not like I could have appeared to be gone, but I open the window and he flips out, completely in a panic. He's looking around frantically trying to find what to do, pipe in one hand and baggy in the other, as if I'll just shout and the cops will come ripping into the drive through. He ends up just tossing both over to his gf and now she is panicking. Neither even consider the glove compartment, so she just kinda hides it between her legs, like a kid that stole some candy. I have obviously seen everything, but she looks up all doe-eyed, hoping she's in the clear. I just smile and hand them the food, wishing them a safe drive, then close the window. That must have been the biggest relief to them. 

Another night, after we close, I've taken off my headset and can no longer hear if cars are coming through the drive through. I find that one has when I see lights flashing through the window. It's a patrol car, and the officer inside says they're actively looking for a suspect in the immediate area. Said he's a large black male wearing... Cookie Monster pajamas. I ask everyone and none of us have seen the guy, so the officer pulls off to search the lot. I thought it was funny, but my coworker would not go outside. Had to walk her to her car. |-| 
|-| co10y4e || 5 || I worked nights at a hotel for ten years. There is a stairwell that leads up to the third-floor meeting room and once you get to the top you can simply glance to the left and see through the windows of the meeting room doors. 

I'm doing a quick walk-around at 2:00am one night and I reach the top and and glance left quickly and turn to the right to keep marching... But wait... The lights in the room were on and there was a middle-age woman with long dark hair and a floral print dress sitting at a table staring out the window towards me...

But there shouldn't have been. I turn back around and finish my double-take. The room was dark, locked, and empty as it should have been. This was all in the space of three seconds but I swear I saw someone in there. It still freaks me out to this day. |-| 
|-| co1129d || 6 || Probably late to the thread, but here it goes. I work as a CNA at a nursing home, and the only creepy thing that happened was when a resident died. I work nights, so often it is dead silent and fairly creepy on its own. So as I was exciting the floor to smoke a cigarette I went through the solid wood doors to the hallway that leads to the back, and as a walk down the hall, I distinctly heard an older woman say very clearly "I'm not ready to go". I chalked it up a resident on the other side of the doors, but sure enough, I asked my coworker if she heard anything. Sure as shit, she didn't hear a thing. So I brushed it off, and went on my way. As soon as I come back I start vitals so I make my way into a residents room, only to find her dead. Just to add some details, I heard the voice at around 12:20am. I come back at roughly 12:30am. And she had clearly just passed a few minutes prior. It was very odd, and gave me the chills. |-| 
|-| co0x3el || 15 || not a night shift worker but contributor to "weirdest" things. Once climbed onto the roof of a gas station where my buddy worked, climbed into the escape hatch which emptied into the managers office, from there snuck into the cooler, then kept opening the cooler doors from inside and letting them slam until I could see my buddy getting whiter and whiter in the face until I ran around the corner and yelled "HAAAAAAA" almost got stabbed in the face.  |-| 
|-| co0wx40 || 8 || Not particularly creepy, but when I worked in the LA area I started work as early as possible to avoid traffic, so I usually started between 5am and 7am. It was inconsistent because I worked on installing and servicing control systems all over the city and different places had different starting times. I also had undiagnosed severe sleep apnea and was lucky to get a few hours of sleep every other night or so. 2 to 3 times per week I would find myself giving up on sleep at 1 or 2 am and then heading off to a job site where I would listen to soothing music in my car and hopefully nap an hour or two before work. If I didn't do that there was a good chance of nodding off while stuck in traffic. This left me roaming around the city during the dead-lull hours of the night in a half-sleep trance several nights per week. Many people may not realize it but metro Los Angeles is completely dead from about 2:30am until just before 5am. It's like there is a net of silence thrown over the city during those hours. Even the suburbs are more active during these hours and actually have more stores and bars open. It was at these times that I never felt lonelier in my life. Being alone and stuck in a half-asleep state in an eerie gloomy silence in the middle of 10 million people laying in the dark was a creepy feeling for sure.

**TL;DR not actually creepy at all.** |-| 
|-| co0yyo2 || 4 || I work mostly 12 hour shifts, 7pm-7am, at a printing factory, we print direct mailers. I'm not sure how strange or out of the norm it is But I've seen massive coke deals go down, massive amounts of coke snorted, seen an FBI raid, street racers crash and nearly die, and so much hatred for gay people but it seems like 3AM is the time of the night where super straight people start to turn gay. I hate working these hours but I can honestly say that it's never boring. |-|

He didn't get one. |-|

The drive home I usually had the roads to myself. One night I'm on the highway going at least 15 over the speed limit, and another car comes out of nowhere and comes right up next to me.

I look over and two state troopers are just looking at me. I take my foot off the gas and they just fly down the road into the night.  Still not sure why I didn't get a ticket. |-|

|-| co11mnb || 4 || Worked midnights at a mental health inpatient unit. One night I take a shortcut to get to the pharmacy to get meds for a patient to be released (pharmacy shut down at midnight and we wouldn't be able to get the samples  so the patient could be released) . 


This was sort of an unusual thing because patients weren't usually discharged at 11 p.m. which was the start of my shift, but tge attending was running late that day due to some emergency. 

I take the shortcut through an area of the hospital that was once used as a transitional care unit for the elderly. The area has since been shut down because of low patient census. It was creepy because it looked like people had just up and left suddenly. The unit hadn't been cleared out and was eerie Some items were being stored along the hallways, excess I..V. poles, beds, etc. 

This shortcut saved time because the only other way to get to the pharmacy was to go to the ground floor and back. As I walked through the semi dark , abandoned hallway , just as I pass the nurses station with all the call lights , a light goes off indicating someone has pushed the button in one of the rooms. 

The system was an older push button system where the light would screech and light up to the corresponding room number. I sped though that hallway as fast as I could . I'm thankful that the call system wasn't more modern and equipped with sound. |-|

|-| co134xg || 4 || I used to work in a theatre as an usher but part of the job included helping set up the stage and the gym (used as a warm up stage for dancers). This theatre was connected to my highschool and was rented out during weekends for dance contests or other events. Usually we get our work done by midnight the night before but for this certain event we were stuck there setting up until 4 am. So it's just me my friend our boss and the janitor, and at around 1 am the janitor starts to hurry up and pack her things and begins leaving. My friend and I asked my boss what her deal was and he said on the first weekend of every month she claims she sees little people running around the high school halls. Now obviously my friend and I thought it was ridiculous so we brushed it off and forgot about it until about an hour later we had to go into the highschool section to get more chairs. While carrying chairs I hear the lockers rustle but pass it off as my friend brushing against them by accident, so I turned to tell him to stop trying to scare me. As I turned around I saw a small quick black blurr pass through my field of vision and more locker rustling. My friend and I just looked at each other and calmly walked out of the highschool area all the while you would hear more slight locker movement. Once we were clear of the highschool halls we bolted to the only lit area in the building which was the theatre and finished working as quickly and quietly as possible. 

Tl:dr little people like to touch lockers at night. |-|

|-| co14t1u || 3 || Preface this by saying I'm a 5'3" girl.  Not large by any means.  

Was doing my thing as an assistant manager at Walmart, having a decent night.  We had this guy, I'll call him Bob, who was working for me.  Nice guy, very quiet, very large, but kept to himself.  Had a weird laugh, but you know, whatever.

So I'm at the department managers work station in our backroom, it's fairly hidden away in a corner of the store- far enough away that nobody is about to come running if I call out.

Bob walks into the room, gives me this long look with this massive smile, and tells me... that god loves me.

Okay.  ...So, Bob, how are you doing on your aisle?  Almost done stocking?

But no, he needs to tell me that God really *really* loves me.  Then he starts getting close enough to me that my back is against the wall and he starts getting loud.  Like, weird loud.  God loves me and he's screaming it in my face.  God loves me more than anything and he's screaming and suddenly has a hand on my chest pinning me to the wall and I'm trying to talk him down because if nobody is hearing him scream, nobody is going to hear me scream either.

Suddenly he lets go, lays on the floor, and I kid you not starts flopping around.  Not seizure- kind of like doing the worm- which sounds funny but I was terrifed.  He's still screaming about god and flipping out all over the floor.

I jump over him and run to get my lead maintenance- also a big guy who tends to be protective.  Cool guy, sweet, massive.  6'2" at least.  We'll call him Jack.  So I run to get Jack and I'm telling him that Bob is flipping out and to come quick.  He looks at me weird but follows- we don't even get to the backroom, Bob is now in the middle of the action alley (main hallway) screaming about God whilst still on the floor flopping around.  Another associate standing there watching him in confusion.

We pretty much stand there for 10 seconds thinking "police?  ambulance?  both?!" when Bob suddenly stands up, apologizes, and decideds to go back to doing his work.  Uh... no.  We escourt him out of the building, he calls his wife from the parking lot (from behind the locked doors, thank you very much- I felt freakin' traumatizes) I report it to my boss.

Who tells me that as a company we try to do our best to help our associate when they're in these situations and if he shows he's getting the help he needs, we may have to invite him back.  And would I be okay with that.  (There's one answer.  Suck it up if it comes down to it- and write him up for as many other things as possible to get him out legally)

Turns out on the security camera, while he hand me pinned to the wall, he had a knife in his hand.  I didn't notice, what with the screaming and god and fish and all that.  We did not have to invite him back because of that, and he's currently staying in an insane asylum.

|-| co11979 || 3 || I worked the night shift at a small pizzaria. They recently reopened after having technical issues. This restaurant had 4 animatronic characters, And I worked alone in an office from 12 AM to 6 AM. These animatronics would walk around at night and make me shit my pants. I asked the technician and he said they shouldn't walk around at all. I was fired 7 days later. |-| 
|-| co0y51e || 3 || Worked the overnight kitchen shift at a hotel. Found the overnight janitor in the back hallway, pants around his ankles, pissing on the wall. He was so shit faced he couldn't find the bathroom. He tried to explain that he was at a world cup party and didn't want to no show to work. Told him to clean up his puddle and go home. |-|

I don't know if this was down to sleep deprivation, but he swears he saw a ghost. A young woman in medieval clothing. |-|

|-| co08r5r || 1162 || Was telling my SO and her cousins  a story about how when I was young, to stop us from going online at night, my dad would block the wall telephone port that we'd plug the computer into with this huge cactus he had. 

Her 13 y/o cousin then asks what a telephone has to do with the internet and why we didn't just turn on the wifi.

Yes why didn't I think of that in 1996??
 |-| 
|-| co0bof3 || 353 || I was at a car dealership when a panicked call came in.  It seemed that the button on a woman's car key that electronically unlocked her car door wasn't working.  She was going hysterical because she couldn't get into her car.  A kindly worker had to talk her through how to put the key itself into the door and turn it until the door unlocked.

Amazing. |-|

None of the kids knew the show. But everyone knew "that guy from the movies." Kids these days...  |-|

|-| co09x5m || 86 || I find all the kids trashing their twelve year-old selves on /r/uglyduckling deeply disturbing. You're going through puberty then, you're supposed to look like [Dave Mustaine's twin sister](http://www.reddit.com/r/uglyduckling/comments/2tgbls/i_had_a_lot_of_different_looks_as_a_child/). 

Why in the hell would you want to look 'sexy' as an [eight year-old](http://www.reddit.com/r/uglyduckling/comments/2s5l7t/i_am_a_transformed_critter_819/)? You should be thankful your mom dressed you funny back then. We all know what happens when you have Mama June raising you . . .

|-| co0bu0q || 114 || my cousin who is in 4th grade has a smartphone. on that phone, he has pages and pages of folders, all full of free games. they're the shittiest mobile games, you know the deal. they're all clones of each other, but for some reason he has all of them. minecraft and all clones of it, every flappy bird, that don't-step-on-the-white-tile game, etc. I don't know why.


so he asks me if I have any games on my phone. I only have a few, I tell him about the one I'm currently playing called 99 bricks. I tell him it's kind of like tetris except you're trying to build a tower instead of clearing lines.


"what's tetris"


doesn't know what tetris is. hundreds of the shittiest low quality awful mobile games and he doesn't know what tetris is.

|-| co09m26 || 201 || I'll be the lone adult who sees kids in a positive light.

I asked one here on Reddit: "How come you guys are always trashing on Beiber? Shouldn't you have moved on to Harry Styles by now, since that's the pic all the middle school girls have on their Trapper Keepers?"

He answered that we trash on Beiber because he's a douche while Styles seems cool and down-to-Earth. I found this refreshing, for since time immemorial middle school boys just blindly trashed whoever happened to be the teen idol of the moment, regardless of their personality or quality of their music. |-|

"Mom, I can't listen to this."
Me: Why not? This is one of the best songs ever!
Daughter: Mom, he's trying to get her drunk and do something to her. 
 |-| 
|-| co0b914 || 68 || Kids these days are a lot smarter than we were.  Realized that at around 45.  The internet may have made them a bit lazier physically, but they're far more informed than we ever were. |-| 
|-| co08ng5 || 116 || My ringtone is the dial up noise our internet machines used to make, someone called it when a mates 17 year old brother was around to have him go freak out wondering what it was.

Actually said 
"Back in my day this meant you could download porn, and we'd wait half an hour just for one picture of titties"  |-| 
|-| co09jhe || 582 || I've been dealing with this for decades, but I was always able to put it into perspective. First time I ever felt out of touch was with grunge music. I come back into town after being on the road for a few years and I go to my favorite punk club. On stage are a bunch of long haired, sleepy looking nitwits clad in flannel playing some of the most boring music I had ever heard. I couldn't understand why everyone there seemed into the band. That's fine, however. Musical tastes change, and i could cope.

I could cope with anything. Internet being everywhere? Fine. I like the internet. Texting? Totally. Now I don't have to speak on the phone. Cameras on phones? Kind of nice our memories will be recorded. Wish they had them twenty years ago.

I rolled with it. I rolled with all of it.

Then my son discovered YouTube.

The minute he started to prefer watching other people play video games to playing video games himself? I just lost it. My brain exploded. Try as I might, I can't get my head around it.

I've tried to be a good father. I tried feigning interest. I tried giving it a shot.

I. Don't. Get. It.

More people want to watch someone play a video game then watched The Wire on HBO? Really?

It made me accept that this is no longer my world. My time has come and gone, and that's fine. It's natural. Millennials? It's your planet now. Have fun with it. |-| 
|-| co0br4f || 86 || I am 25, this happened about 4 months ago. I work for the city and was cleaning up a rose garden when I notice a car full of high school boys blasting music. They are all sitting on the windowsills, taking selfies above the vehicle, driver using both hands to focus the picture. Blew through two stop signs in a shady residential neighborhood. Kinda double-taked, as it happened in about 10 seconds. After a moment, I thought about calling the cops, just as the cops came tearing by after them.  |-| 
|-| co0df28 || 29 || Im 62 and I havent gotten there yet. Nothing surprises me. |-| 
|-| co09pz9 || 112 || Went back to my old high school to watch my sister preform in a play...overheard some kid on the phone with his mom telling her to fuck off and he wanted pizza for dinner instead.

Holy christ if I ever even told my mom to shut up I'd lose teeth instantly. |-| 
|-| co0bzev || 53 || A girl and her mom came up to me at Best Buy and asked where Kpop was.  I showed them the spot for Keurig coffee and Sodastream syrup to be safe because I had never heard of it.  I was bluntly informed it was Korean pop music.  Suburban little white girl and her mom in matching Northface jackets ruined my day by making me feel old. |-| 
|-| co0b2it || 51 || My first day of teaching in my own classroom. A student taped another student to his desk and two snarky girls looked on. When I called them on it they called me "salty." They didn't even get reprimanded by the principal. 
 |-| 
|-| co0bed5 || 87 || Maybe not the age group that OP wanted, but I still consider them kids, because they sure as hell aren't adults.

I work at a karaoke bar, in a very populated university town, running the karaoke system. It's a pretty fun part time job, which usually involves me getting drunk, subtly making fun of the audience and calling people up to the stage to sing.

Anyway, being located within walking distance of two universities means that our primary customers are nineteen. I've been working there for about 5 years and every year the next wave of nineteen year olds are a little different. This year though, things have really changed.

Now every group has a dedicated selfie taker, or a snapchater or a person filming them sing (vertically, of course). The kids aren't so much enjoying singing a song, but rather are way more interested in showing the digital world that they did something "cool". I find it pretty sad that they can't just enjoy a moment and choose to see their world through a touch screen.

Oh also, some girl asked me the other day if we had the song that went "sweet home Alabamaaaa". Kids these days. |-| 
|-| co09pzb || 106 || Fucking Snapchat.  |-| 
|-| co0c507 || 23 || I'm only 23 but I'd like to submit the phrase "on fleek." It means something like "on point" or, you know, "good." It's commonly used to refer to eyebrows but for the life of me I can't figure out why. Why don't they just say that the eyebrows are "on point" or why not "those eyebrows look great"? That was the moment when I realised that I no longer understand young people.  |-| 
|-| co0bkk1 || 313 || When a 14 year old with a fading green skrillex hair cut blithely told me she was pansexual and non-gendered. In a convenience store check out. With no prompting. |-| 
|-| co0cx43 || 127 || I teach 8th grade so I have these moments on the daily.  One of my favorites happened when we were discussing Thomas Jefferson using sarcasm.  A student said, "they had sarcasm back then?!" I asked him how long he thought sarcasm had been around, he said "about 10 years." And another student responded saying, "at the MOST." |-|

|-| co0c029 || 54 || Both gender sleepovers aren't allowed anymore. Don't get me wrong, at that special age there's a cut off to both genders having sleep overs together, but why is our society so sexually charged we assume 5-8 year olds can't play together?  |-| 
|-| co0b6g6 || 19 || New recruits being allowed cell phones in basic training  |-| 
|-| co0anf5 || 150 || I work for a website that's used for making Yearbooks. This year there are kids leaving secondary school born *after* 9/11. They're only 10 years younger than me (I'm 25) but it astounds me that perhaps the defining moment of history in my lifetime is just a page in a textbook to them.  |-|

|-| co0a4ds || 167 || when i was at my 7 year old cousin's elementary school talent show &amp; some child sang bruno mars. somehow i was the only one visibly cringing at a child belting, "YOUR SEX TAKES ME TO PARADISE~" pretty sure i would never have been allowed to listen to that song at that age, let alone have parents &amp; teachers allow me to sing it publicly... |-| 
|-| co09uaw || 58 || When people started using twitter. I am 25. I don't get it.  |-| 
|-| co0bwzt || 54 || I'm a successful and moderately well known entrepreneur in my town. A college kid contacted me on LinkedIn and asked if he could have 1 to 2 hours of my time for an "information interview".  He happened to catch me at a particularly busy time, where I had 3 overseas trips coming up in the next two months, and two fairly large projects pending so I wrote him a polite note saying that I was sorry, but that it just wasn't possible for at least a few months, and very briefly explained why. 

He sent me this pissy, indignant whiny reply, basically telling me off and demanding an interview at the same time. It was one of those, "Oh, this is what people are talking about when they talk about how entitled kids are these days." |-| 
|-| co08g1o || 95 || Every time I see someone using there real name on the internet and/or posting something incriminating to Facebook.  We didn't do that shit back in the day. |-|

Low and high top fades are back in style

They have no clue, they probably think *they* came up with this stuff. Fucking kids. |-| 
|-| co0b01f || 37 || I'm 31 and, as a college prof, have a lot of "kids these days" moments, but the one that probably bugs me the most is just the sheer amount of texting you do.  I send maybe 10-20 texts a day max and if I have anything that can't be said with just a few words I'd much rather call the person but I know a lot of kids send hundreds if not thousands of texts everyday.  It is insane to me that if you have that much to say to each other you wouldn't just get it all out in a phone conversation instead. |-| 
|-| co0bu2j || 27 || When I went to a restaurant at Christmas and saw a family of four sitting next to each other, silent, playing on their smart phones, including the littlest one. It was so fucking depressing.  |-| 
|-| co0awin || 49 || Probably the first time I saw ear gauges. |-| 
|-| co0g56c || 14 || I went to see a movie with my dad to waste an afternoon. Halfway through the previews, a group of 5 high-schoolers come in and sit in front of us. Completely ignoring all forms of theater etiquette, they whipped out their smartphones and started checking Facebook and talking to each other about someone else's posts. I thought they would stop when the movie started, but no, this continued throughout most of the movie. I thought to myself, "Goddamn kids, you each paid 10 bucks, and now you sit and chat and ruin the experience for everyone?" Then I think, "Wait, I'm only 7 years older than these guys at most. What have I become?"
Still though, who pays money to watch a movie, then does everything in their power to not watch a movie? Kids these days. |-| 
|-| co0m114 || 13 || Being 27 years old and spending most of my childhood (mid 90's-early 00's) as a computer nerd, I think it's just the sheer *pace* of technological innovation that's helping bring the "I feel old now" age younger and younger. 

One of the moments was realizing that my boss' 8 year old son was not only proficient in iOS...but that he'd literally never experienced a home Internet connection less than 1 Mbps. Or a lack of Wi-Fi. 

It's crazy how much more powerful modern technology is. I keep around a 1985 Mac SE just for kicks, and it's just kinda hilarious to set a modern smartphone down next to it and think how far tech has progressed in the past 30 years. 

One of my buddies drives a 1985 Golf, and it works essentially the same as my mom's 2015 Golf. It's got three pedals and a steering wheel. It has rubber tires. You put dinosaur juice in it and it burns it and makes fun sounds. It drives on roads perfectly fine. 

Try getting that Mac SE onto the modern Internet. It'd melt trying to render this comment thread. 

EDIT: Oh, and to answer OP's question a second time - when I started actually having to use urban dictionary to seriously look up modern slang. I instantly felt a decade older.  |-|

the saggy pants thing with penguin walk really pisses me off. not because of the indecency but because of the idiocy. you're walking like a penguin to keep your jeans at thigh/knee level. you're slow and clumsy and you look like an idiot

radio-friendly hip hop sucks nowadays. it was made for a generation raised on Spongebob Squarepants. that show annoys me because the same stupid jokes are repeated and re-repeated and re-re-repeated.

my nephew and I were driving around yesterday and some song comes on:

"at the CLUB(?) blowin UP on a Tuesday..
got your GIRL(?) she choosy..
at the CLUB(?) blowin UP on a Tuesday..
got your GIRL(?) she choosy..
at the CLUB(?) blowin UP on a Tuesday..

|-| co0a1p2 || 20 || So many stories from teaching teenagers.

I had to explain what an OHP and a transperancy was. Some have also never seen a chalkboard.

Don't get me started how pampered they are that they can find something about someone on the other side of the world in any time period in literally seconds. I find they take this for granted and having knowledge is not important as everything they need to know can be looked up. |-|

|-| co0d7eg || 34 || Going back to college at the age of 25/26.  Kids sagging down to their ankles.  Like...come on man that shit just looks stupid.  I can see all of your underwear bro.  That isn't cool.  And this weird infatuation kids have now of always listening to music.  Going to class?  Better put my headphones on.  Sitting in class?  Better put my headphones on.  Standing in line to get something to eat?  Better put my headphones on. 

And I'm no fashion guy, but some of it is just laughably bad.  Kids force themselves into stupid-looking suits to go to class.  Or they just wear pajamas.  Or I swear they just grab the loudest article of clothing per body part and put it on.  Bright pink zig/zag shirt with orange and blue checkered shorts, zebra socks, and flip flops.  Like WTF.

The other thing I noticed a lot of is the constant cussing.  It's like, "this is the first time we can cuss in public without getting in trouble, so we're gonna do it nonstop."  This leads to awkward cussing like "I'm going to the god damn lunch room, like fuck."  Huh?  "We got any fucking homework due tomorrow?"

College in general is cringeworthy as hell. |-| 
|-| co0bcoo || 10 || 1. I did an internship at an elementary school, and was shocked at how disrespectful little kids were to adults. When I was a kid we always had that one ''bad kid'' in class, but in general I remember thinking of pretty much every adult as an authority figure. 

2. This is not just about younger people, but every time I see massive oversharing on social media, I am so grateful Facebook, twitter, etc., didn't exist when I was an angsty adolescent. Luckily my AOL homepage where I posted my terrible poetry has been eradicated.  |-| 
|-| co0hl2l || 10 || I spent my childhood summers in the countryside, running around outside, climbing trees, mowing grass, collecting berries, going to see the local cow herd. 

Now kids just play on smart phones all the time. My younger brothers (who'll probably end up reading this post) aren't interested at all in the countryside any more, they just want to be on their computer and IPads.

Instead of moshing/dancing, these two 18 year olds started running around and pretended to fight. But it was like that's how they thought you are supposed to dance to this type of music...you run around the room and do pretend karate moves. Wtf? 

At that moment I realised I was old and that I don't understand the next generation. |-|

    i=1
    #Now for our message of hope
    if(i==1){
        print("Hello World!")
    }

i opened by telling the students that in order to use a comment, you use a pound symbol and it will disregard everything you write after that. this lets you write notes to yourself without breaking your code. the whole class looked at me like i sprouted a third arm out of my face, so i took out my laptop and showed them what i meant.

then someone blurted out, "OH! you mean a hashtag!" to which i responded, "...yes, thats right. a hashtag." |-|

I'm literally writing this on my smartphone, and I use it all day, everyday, for everything, but only when I'm alone.  I find it socially gross when someone chooses to browse Twitter, Facebook or Instagram rather than acknowledge me.

|-| co0k9ix || 3 || I worked at a camp last summer and played Super Mario 3D World with a few of the kids.  We were playing a Boo's mansion level that was deliberately colored in monochrome for a kind of cheesy horror movie look.  One of the kids kept yelling, "Look, there's no color!  It's like the 80's!"  I tried explaining to her that color television was invented a few decades before the 1980's, but she didn't believe me.  This was an 80's level. |-|

|-| co0mq84 || 3 || What's kind of cool about growing up during the dawn of the Internet age allows those to know what a betamax is but also know and understand what a record, cassette tape, compact disc, and MP3's are and we appreciate them for what they were. We know that there was a time before television and people used to "watch" radio. I feel we have a better understanding and appreciation for what it took to transition from the dawn of technological age to where we are today. And not only that but we can still enjoy the new technology. 

What I find myself being disappointed about is all the lost appreciation the millennials have for how much tech has changed in just the last 15-20 years. I get it. It's not their fault but they just don't know how easy they have it.

|-| co08x6p || 10 || Being an early Gen Xer, I've been in the workforce for 20 years.  I've worked for 90% Boomers, who while selfish, have knowledge of working and that benefitting the company, benefits all of us.  The Boomers have been retiring in droves and Millenials with a lot of schooling (Masters degrees with 0 experience) are getting oportunities they aren't prepared for.  They are also selfish, and expect the best work environment possible, regardless of cost.  They don't realize how it affects the bottom line, share price, board decisions and ultimately benefits and compensation.  Not to mention the poor policy decisions they make and the amount of time/productivity lost bringing them up to speed.  It'll get better and they will learn, but watching them all drive leased BMWs while living at mommy and daddy's house, thinking they are doing a great job, while taking four times as long as it takes an experienced admin to do a report is excruciating. |-|

Things didn't change. I did. My mindset changed. I saw things differently.

Sitting here in this lowrent gin-joint, waiting for the man of the hour to arrive, I wondered if my career path could have, should have gone differently. Regardless, I had made my choices. 

A kill was a kill, and a paycheck was a paycheck. This one was no different. I never much cared what they did to warrant someone putting a hit out on them. 

Soon, he would walk in. I would 'spill my drink' on him, apologize, and rush out before the cyanide took effect. If done properly, I would be long gone before anyone realized it was anything but a heart attack.

As I looked up, I saw his face on a television above the bar. He was a philanthropist, it seemed. A local who helped the homeless. A local with a drinking problem, too. Still, the people who signed my checks always got what they paid for.

|-| co0l2f7 || 85 || Paintball. 150 for a starter kit and marker (gun) 50 bucks for paint. But then the craving sets in and you want to shoot Evil paint everyday which is 70 a box, you arent using CO2 anymore so you spend 200 on an HPA tank. Your Spyder marker with the 12" .687 barrel doesn't work as well as your friends Tippman with the ceramic .683 14" rifled barrel so you shell out 500 for the entire setup, all the while shooting fluorescent Evils. You see Dye has the new I4 mask out and the pros use Dye so you drop another 200 for that mask. Now you arent playing woodsball anymore because its cold, so you graduate to speedball indoors and realise this Tippmann marker sucks compared to all the other lightweight guns out there. Dye has the DM14 but its 1300 bucks, but you can get it all bundled with one of their newer masks for only 1500. 

Now its speedball only and can go through 2000 balls in 5 games but 5 games is only one hour and a half of paintball and you drove 2 hours from home to get to the venue because Philadelphia is a ban on paintball and airsoft so you decide to stay till 4 so you start buying a case of 5000 balls and another larger HPA tank because the first 3000 PSI one is the backup and next thing you know you've spent 5000 dollars in one year. So you stop, and now have 5000 in gear sitting in a closet not doing anything because you're busy at work and you have a few tenants and other cheaper hobbies like drinking and video games take up all your time. You plan to go out again in spring but spring turns into 3 years and you promise to start again in 2015 but the Witcher 3 is coming out and you haven't finished Dragon Age Inquisition yet.  |-|

|-| co0q4aq || 14 || Surprised I haven't seen this, but actually sport level drifiting or rally driving? 

Sport level drifting will require a rwd car, reinforced, caged, a lot of performance tuning, and then the amount you spend on tires, it's like 800 a set, and can burn off in a few runs. Then to top it all off, anything can happen that will send you into a wall, frame damage, broken wheels, busted suspension, anything!

Rally driving, you need an AWD car that puts down a lot of power to the wheels to help go through gravel, dirt, etc. Need all of the above, same things can happen. But in rally you can roll and completely total a car. 

If you're serious about any of these, just to start drifting or rally effectively, you'd probably need 20-30k down on just your car, not to mention track fees. |-|

No biggie, lets go down the list. A new Chevy V8 (You HAVE to get a V8, what's a muscle car without a V8?) will run you $1300+, having a transmission rebuilt is no less $600. It's got scratches? Well shit you have to repaint the whole car and a decent paint gun is usually under $100 and paint is $30 a can or you can have it professionally paint for $3000+. Let's not forget, it's a car, so shit is eventually gonna break or fall off and hit that grandma in the Grand Marquis behind you while you're trying to burnout at the stoplight because those chicks in the Corolla were totally (not) checking you out. Parts for a '67 Camaro are $50 to $1500 per part or you can but a parts car (and let's face it, those assholes on Craigslist aren't gonna let their rusted-out, family heirloom of a '68 Camaro go for any less than $5000).  |-|

I stand up a couple before to make sure I can make it to the door without awkwardly having to shove through everyone last minute and have the bus potentially leave without me getting off. I find a spot that's closest to a button for stops and a pole to hold on to. Gotta make sure it's near a door though.

I think it's still on Netflix. Anyone who likes film, cartoons, video games or generally going "behind the scenes" will enjoy. Also a great watch if you're a performer/actor. A bunch of busy voice actors who we don't typically get to "see" are featured.  |-|

|-| co06b9l || 14 || Children Underground- available on Netflix.  About homeless children living in the underground subway stations of Bucharest, Hungary.  You watch them struggle to survive, hustle enough money to buy the paint they'll huff to get high, and sometimes see them return home.  Watching 9 year olds cheering and hugging each other because they got enough paint to get high for a few hours is unsettling.  

Waste Land- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUAavzJsTBw  A story about an artist who goes to world's largest landfill in Rio De Janiero and films the stories of the people who scavenge trash in order to survive.  He then turns their pictures into art using trash (that part is hard to explain).  But watch it, it's a very uplifting movie.

The Pixar Story- If you are a fan of their movies, this is a great documentary about the company's origin, and development of their first 5 or 6 movies.  Really cool back stories and behind the scenes stuff.   |-|

Less than half an hour so set a lunch break aside just to watch it. It is a disturbingly powerful documentary of a girl, Beth Thomas who was sexually abused when she was 19 months old. Consequently, she has develops reactive attachment disorder (RAD) and experienced several violent outbursts where she abused animals and her younger brother. The footage of interviews with Beth where she admits to committing such acts drove me to tears, just hearing a little girl say these horrible things without any sign of remorse. Fortunately, therapy proves to be successful for her and she understands the errors in her previous ways. Now, she is a registered nurse and has gone on to live a 'normal' life. |-|

|-| co0buyw || 5 || I really liked the 7 up series. Starting at age 7, a group of British children from various social and economic backgrounds are interviewed every seven years. It is really interesting to see how they change and what kind of people they become. Some of the results are pretty unexpected. It also makes you think about aging and the course of your own life; I have never seen a documentary that left me so introspective for so long. Each installment is average movie-length, so it is a big investment of time because they are up to "56 Up", but I devoured all of them quickly because they were so enthralling. It should be mentioned that there is some question as to how much the filmmakers have "steered" the participants, or whether the interviews are edited to make certain "storylines" apparent, but that just makes them even more thought-provoking, because it brings into question how we present ourselves, and makes you wonder how your life would be seen. Many of the participants are ambivalent towards the films themselves, which says a lot about the way they are presented. Yet they continue to participate for various personal reasons (mainly monetary, iirc).

Also "The Great Happiness Space" was a good one that I haven't seen mentioned yet. Again, there is some question as to how much of the filming is manipulated to show what the filmmakers want to convey. But that is true with a lot of documentaries, and this one has real value as a piece of "art". It is in Japanese with subtitles throughout, which I thought would bug me, but it was so enthralling that I soon forgot about them.

edit: Also, the film "Touching the Void." It is about two mountain climbers who get into major trouble. A truly amazing story that makes you realize how much humans can endure and still survive. |-|

|-| co0aiv0 || 5 || Happy People: A Year in the Taiga

I love anything by Warner Herzog, his voice is so calming and captivating and I just love his style. In this doc he travels to Siberia to film locals going about their days. Makes me feel like a lazy POS watching it on my couch in my heated apartment, but it's fascinating to me how people still possess raw human usefulness in the wild.


Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer

This is an extremely disturbing but well put together documentary that tells the story of Aileen Wuornos up until she is executed for her crimes. She truly lost touch with reality and the filmmaker shows her most manic moments as well as when she is completely at peace with what she's done and with her death sentence. You question whether she is actually crazy or a victim of the mental health system and substance abuse/victim of her circumstances growing up. Highly recommended.

|-| co0npud || 13 || I live in the United States and I really love the [Flag of Brazil](http://imgur.com/3ZlHwP5). 

It's just so unique. From Wikipedia, the green represents the House of Pedro I Braganza, the first Emperor of Brazil. The yellow represents the House of Hapsburg, the royal house of the first Empress, Maria Leopoldina.

The stars on the flag are the star positions over Rio de Janeiro on the date of Brazilian independence, and each star represents one of Brazil's federated states. 

The phrase on the flag, *ORDEM E PROGRESSO* is Portuguese for "order and progress." Simple and elegant. It is apparently derived from the the phrase, "Love as a principle and order as the basis; progress as the goal."

It's so much better than their [first idea for a flag](http://imgur.com/lEqyQH1). |-|

One of my 4th grade boys was playing tag and accidentally ran into a 1st grade girl and knocked her over. She cried and he helped her up and apologized. She was fine, just wanted attention. She was fine until she saw her dad walking up to the school. The second she sees him she starts wailing again and runs up to him.

I am with the rest of the group and we are slowly making our way inside before it gets dark. Dad walks up to 4th grade boy and yells in his face "Did you fucking punch my daughter?!" 

Immediately I tell the kids to go inside and not come out (there were other staff inside) and I stay outside trying to calm down the man. As I explained that I saw the entire situation and thought that maybe she was confused he proceeded to yell in my face things like "Are you calling my daughter a fucking liar? YOU are a fucking liar," etc...

It turned into this big thing where my bosses were asking if I wanted to press charges and all of this stuff. They also did not want me to be the only staff with his children even if there are many other kids around. I felt bad for the man's older son who had no idea what was going on and was actually good friends with the boy who accidentally knocked his sister down.

I didn't press charges. Just ignored the man every time I saw him. It was very, very hard. |-|

|-| co9ff0r || 420 || When I was in Jr. High I got moved to advanced math way early and had a brutal time with the material, so my parents hired one of the teachers to tutor me. I was at her house going over the homework and her kid was crying in the other room, so she excused herself. A minute later I heard yelling followed by a wet thwack/thump, then the crying stopped. She came back and continued tutoring me. A few minutes later the crying started again, she excuses herself again, I hear more yelling and then an even louder thwack/thump. The crying stops. She comes back to the table and I said Mrs. X, you have blood on your hand. I remember she laughed, like "oh silly me"! She washed her hand, came back and finished the tutoring. So a few weeks go by and I kept thinking about it...for some reason I didn't tell my folks, but after a while I mentioned it to another teacher I liked, kind of expecting (hoping?) she'd brush it off as nothing to worry about - except she got real serious. Asked me to recount the whole thing to a guidance counselor, so I did- still expecting them to be like "hey kid it's nothing, no worries". And the counselor did say that. Told me not to worry, everything was ok.

Then a couple of days later the teacher/tutor wasn't in school. They told everyone she had found a better job and moved away.

 I found out months later that my story sparked an investigation that ended with both her and her husband being arrested for severely abusing their mentally handicapped son. I don't know why, but there was never any mention in the news or papers. Nobody at school ever mentioned it again. 

And I remember feeling horribly guilty that I'd ruined my tutor's life. Now as an adult I know that feeling of guilt was natural, but horribly misplaced. I never did find out what became of their son. I've never looked into it cause frankly I'm afraid what I'd find. But 20 years later I still think about it sometimes.

Come January, back in school, we find out she died. She had cancer for half a year and we never knew. The whole school was a bit shaken. |-| 
|-| co8ywx4 || 1028 || I caught a girl snorting coke from the bathroom counter. Also I teach some students with severe autism. One of the things we do is wait until the halls are empty to walk them simply because they are so violent we wear Kevlar ppe. There are only 4 of them, and most kids don't even know they are at the school. |-| 
|-| co95flg || 290 || How short we are on money. The school I work at is very strict about paper for example, so when my students complain about having front and back pages, I pretend that I have some green vibe in me. 
+ what happens in the teachers' lounge. If they knew how childish some of my colleagues are, they'd lose any trace respect that might have had before. |-| 
|-| co96lf2 || 596 || My 3rd grade teacher was one of the nicest most kind hearted people I have met in my life and one day after work she went home to find her son dead on the couch from a heroin overdose. She never was the same and never taught again after that very sad :( |-| 
|-| co8vyn7 || 1556 || I want to answer on behalf of my 11th grade English teacher who was going through a divorce and a custody battle for his 4-year old daughter during the time he spent teaching us. Some days it was very apparent that something was really eating away at him (this teacher had a very distinct personality - you could tell when he was off). I'm sure it was an immensely difficult time for him, especially because he continued to teach us in what was one of the more memorable classes I've ever taken. I didn't find out the details of what was going on until after I graduated and he left the school. |-| 
|-| co95kkk || 2826 || Not a teacher but... When I was in highschool I worked for the office as a student aid for zero period. The lady who watched over me was extremely kind and obviously from money. In my Sophomore year, she quit working at the school. It turns out that she had a daughter who had been kidnapped when the daughter was eleven and the mother had been volunteering to keep her mind off the situation. 

She quit because her daughter, Jaycee Dugard, was found alive after being held captive for 18 years.  |-| 
|-| co8xsek || 1826 || Two teachers had sex at my school. One was married. I didn't like either of them and was glad that they both were fired.

Edit: I did not expect for so many people to read this. I liked all the stories you have told me. Apparently this happens quite a bit and usually the teachers are not fired. |-| 
|-| co9cg55 || 343 || One of the teachers my mum works with had 2 daughters. 

One had a very severe heart problem and needed open heart surgery. 

The other booked to go to Australia and was hesitant to go due to her sisters bad health.  The sister encouraged her to go and said that she'd try and schedule the surgery for when she returned in a month. 

The daughter who went to Australia died in a quad biking accident on her third week. 

So this teacher had to cope with one daughter dying at her side and another daughter who died on the other side of the world.  :( |-| 
|-| co92itw || 670 || Not a teacher - however my dad was the guidance counselor (small school, he was #3 in the administration pecking order) and the local teacher's union president. Knew/heard wayyyyyyy too much about a lot of things involving staff and parents - divorces, affairs, CPS cases, turf wars, etc. 


At one point I knew my best friend's parents were getting a divorce before he did. That was tough for me. The toughest for my dad, I think, was having to tell a kid that his twin sister had gotten into a car accident on the way to school and passed. 


Most memorable drama though would have to have been that one of our Superintendent's who seemed fantastic in most respects, but a bit aloof with the students, was actually an emotional basketcase who regularly broke down in staff meetings and had the entire staff on edge for the better part of 3 years and caused the school to be quite dysfunctional. We missed out on a lot of grant money because of her. 


Overall, having that kind of insight and knowledge of stuff made me very cognizant of the fact that everyone has burdens and is fighting a personal battle of some sort, despite appearances to the contrary.

|-| co95wxn || 652 || 1. Turns out one of the teachers/coaches and his wife are nudists and all those summer trips were to a nudist colony. A student was doing door to door fundraising, rang the bell, he answered in the nude, she spread the word at school. 

2. A PE teacher was cheating on her husband (another teacher at the school) with the boys' soccer coach. 

3. The AP U.S. History teacher and biology teacher were in the midst of a divorce. She had already gone back to using her maiden name so not many students were aware when they referred to their "slutty ex wife" or "asshole ex husband" that they were, in fact, referring to the teacher 4 doors down the hall.  |-| 
|-| co8zhsk || 687 || Not teacher. Mom was administrator at the school I went to. Most days, because she worked late, every night I would just chill in the computer lab, hittin up miniclip like a mofo. So I'm there one night, and I look over my shoulder, and I see my teacher talking to the headteacher. Think nothing of it of course. 

It was my teachers first year at the school, and it was pretty clear to everyone there that she had no fucking clue what she was doing. Couldn't handle the class, nor did she know the subject matter. 

Next Morning, headteacher has a meeting with us that our teacher has been fired, and that the teacher we had last year (Who was currently on a 2 year trip in new zealand surfing), was coming back.

TL;DR I watched my teacher get fired. |-| 
|-| co987jm || 454 || Joining to the "not a teacher, but...": Once upon a time my friend's classmate had to leave the classroom a little earlier after the school supervisor spoke privalety with the teacher. Of course her classmates started to laugh and say jokes about that girl did something wrong to be "punished" and laughing at the situation, but all lasted until the teacher had enough and angrily dropped the info: The girl's father killed her mother and siblings, being she the one survivor for being in school at that time. All the class, including my friend, started to cry and feel like shit.

And yes, the murder was even on tv news. :C |-| 
|-| co9g48x || 121 || Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'm a male high school art teacher. I don't pay much attention to the crazy stuff that goes on, I know of one female teacher that would sleep with her students when they turned 18 and graduated. And yea she would groom them. She's gone now transfered far from the student population.

The real drama comes from me. If the the teachers, students and parents knew of my metal state I doubt they would keep me around. About a year ago I tried to kill myself. Swallowed a bunch of  sleeping pills, lived through it somehow. I've tried twice before that. I know many of my students would be devastated. Have a panic attack or mental break down about 1-2 times a month, very rarely at school. Know one ones , except for my mentor teacher, though she thinks I go to a therapist for job stress. She has no clue the extent of my issues. 

I often wonder if my students know or can tell about me. They know I get stressed like any other teacher. One student did see me in the lobby of my therapist's office. She is the kindest and most talented kid I've met, so I don't worry too much. 

I sought out to get help, and I am doing better. I don't abuse drugs or alcohol. It's crazy to have a meltdown on my way to work and put on a straight face. I guess I do it well. |-| 
|-| co929iq || 350 || Where i went to school all the drama was out in the open with the teachers or staff, like for instance the Financial Secretary at my high school was caught embezzling money from the athletic and theater departments, 159,000$ stolen in over 3 years.

Edit: this was in colorado |-| 
|-| co94iln || 276 || I became friends with a teacher, and after I graduated high school and there was no conflict of interest, he invited me to his birthday the following year. Of course there were heaps of my old teachers and some new ones from lower year levels I'd never seen before. 

One of the new ones was talking about how scared one girl made her, because she wrote a really detailed creative writing story about a girl with serious mental problems and what it's like, she gave quotes, and basically said that now she's read this, a ton of the girl's behaviour in class makes sense. At the time I was about 90% sure I knew who she was talking about. So that was really weird and kinda creepy. Hope the teacher talked to her about it, or something. |-| 
|-| co9bleg || 145 || My IT teacher from high school approached me once while I was taking parts inventory for one of his classes since I was his TA, to ask me how to stay positive when a family member has cancer. 

Backstory: two months prior to my senior year, my teacher's daughter had gotten leukemia and was in really bad shape. 

Now, this teacher always has a happy attitude and loves teaching IT, and this event really brought him down. Anyways, I explained to him that everything was going to be alright and that his daughter was well taken care of by the professionals at UMC here in Tucson. Hell, if they were able to get Gabrielle Giffords back on her feet after the shooting, they can help his daughter get through her leukemia. What started out as advice turned out to be a pep talk in which he relayed to his daughter, ultimately giving her the persistence to fight her cancer; she's been cancer-free since fall 2013.

tl;dr Gave a teacher a pep talk on how to deal with a loved-one that was stricken with cancer. |-| 
|-| co8wrnt || 447 || A physics teacher lost his wife and few weeks before the end of the year. Then he had two daughters on his own.

|-| co8wjpy || 400 || Two of my high school teachers hooked up. They both taught history. One was a pretty big guy, the other was a really skinny gal. Both mid 40s. It was cute, but against the rules I think. I only knew because I saw them holding hands together at the grocery store.  |-| 
|-| co8vybo || 1215 || Not teacher. Dad is. Works with special ed. Students.

Bitchy teacher was literally THROWING cups at kids for snack time. My dad got real pissed. Took her outside, scolded her for being acting like a terrible person, then went to his boss and informed her about the incident. He had to take over the class while the teacher got called up. |-| 
|-| co96bvs || 274 || I teach compter science at a college. One of our recent "graduates" faked her degree. I know that sounds crazy. She failed one of my colleagues' courses recently which should have kept her from graduating. But this girl had a friend in our registrar's office who substituted the course for something entirely unrelated. The substitution must be approved by me since I'm her advisor. I said no, but she somehow still got her diploma. The substitution is on her degree audit with no record of who approved it. 

Our department has since been in a long struggle with the registrar's office over who permitted the substitution. Whoever did this should be fired. Well, I  know exactly who did it. But there's no paperwork to prove it.

So the world will keep spinning and somewhere out there an employer will hire this girl and be extremely disappointed.

Edit: grammar and I still don't think I did it right... |-| 
|-| co98ga5 || 75 || A parent wanted to come to class with her son to take notes for him, also wanted weekly conferences with me to discuss his grade in my class. Threw a fit when I refused both of her requests.

|-| co9eqjk || 37 || My 7th grade science teacher, who really propelled me on my life course of becoming a science teacher, was gay. Unfortunately, she worked and I attended a small Catholic K through 8 school. She loved Xena warrior princess. We saw her around our small town with her 'best friend'.... always with her best friend. All the other teachers at this small school must have known. But it would have been scandalous if the parents found out or if she ever dared to share with us who she was as a person.

One day she cried because a kid had written homophobic things about another kid on a bathroom stall. I mean full on bawled. I'll never forget sitting there in class and just searching in my head as to why she would react in this way. In hindsight I can't imagine what she was going through not being able to share who was. 

Older me just wants to go back in time and hug her to tell her it will be alright. Younger me didn't quite comprehend the scope of pain she must have felt.  |-| 
|-| co96hwj || 326 || Well, my second sophomore year of high school... okay, I'll explain. Due to shitty luck (and work ethic) I failed my sophomore year and had to repeat it, at my high school all juniors had to take this special class, it was supposed to teach you how to apply for college and about the SAT, all that crap. I was originally put in this class but taken out to make room for "real 11th graders" and ended up being an office assistant in the counselors' office. This was a big multi-room office next to front office. This was a really big high school, there were 8 counselors but the 2 senior counslors' offices were upstairs in senior hall. I was an assistant to the other 6 downstairs. Holy shit! A lot of stuff happens that students don't even know about. 

Mostly, kids have sex at school... a lot. Usually, a boy and girl getting caught coming out of the bathroom together. Surprisingly light punishment for it. APP (in school suspension basically, went there almost 3 years and never found out what APP stands for, anyone know?) for 3 days.


A boy cut his finger off in mechanics. Some people knew, but it was considered a bullshit rumor. It was not.

A girl had a miscarriage during the JROTC mile run. They forced everyone in JROTC to run around the campus while they yell at them and make them scream shit, some kind of wannabe pseudo-bootcamp training simulation. I don't know much about this one but apparently a girl didn't even know she was pregnant and had a miscarriage during it. 


Speaking of pregnant, a girl went into premature labor at school. Everyone wondered why the ambulance was there and I found out later because the counselors kept wondering if they were able to stop labor at the hospital, I'm not sure if they were.

The biggest fucking one was a teacher and student got caught having sex, to be honest, I'm not sure if they were caught in the act, if the girl told her parents, if it was just suspected it or what. But, I do know he was arrested during school hours and hauled out in handcuffs but none of the students knew. No one saw it. A school of 4,000+ students and no one saw it, it took weeks for rumors to really start circulating. We all found out eventually but the day he was arrested there was no scene. It was a BIG deal to the teachers and staff, the counselors would gather in each other's offices and talk about it.


That's all just stuff I overheard during one class period. That was just them gossiping to each other, they closed the door when they had meetings or were talking with a student. This was all bullshit they let the student assistant overhear. I can't imagine what kind of crazy shit happened that I never got to hear about, nothing would really surprise me. |-|

|-| co92483 || 890 || I remember once in sixth grade, me and a bunch of other kids were acting all rowdy until the substitute teacher had enough and called out one of the kids for his behavior

" Josh ( or w.e his name was, I forgot ) how would your mother feel if she knew you were acting like this?"

John kinda just stopped and looked at her with a blank face and said 

" My mothers dead " 

Without missing a beat the teacher replied 

" Well why don't you just get a new one?"

The whole class went *beserk*  kids swearing at the teacher , flipping tables, running out of the class room, throwing shit at the teacher and while everybody (myself included) went ape shit, Josh kinda just sat at his desk and started twirling his pencil. Anyways principal got involved and managed to quiet everything down and made sure not a word of the incident reached the rest of the school. 

TLDR: Kids acts up. Teacher acts wrong |-| 
|-| co9ibjp || 82 || I became a computer sciences teacher at my former high school for one year. Some of my teachers were still there while others retired. For this story, I'll call the subject Ms. Huerta. She taught me World Literature and made my life living hell while I was a student. I have VERY BAD penmanship and she deducted points from my tests just because of that. It annoyed me and I tried to get better, to no avail. She was intense and, only in hindsight, I have to admit that my appreciation for literature came thanks to how she engaged the students with thoughtful dialogue. At times students don't give teachers anything to work with, but Ms. Huerta always found ways to get people interested.

When I became a teacher, she was aloof but respectful. We chatted a couple of times and I saw that she was a very interesting woman. She hated driving in Mexico City, as she felt traffic got her too stressed. She chose to travel in buses and Metro (subway) while reading.

Two months into the school year she had an accident. A REALLY bad one. The bus she was riding tried to cross the rails before an oncoming train. Only 3 persons survived out of he 46 riding it. Ms. Huerta was one of them and she was emotionally scarred, as she saw people torn to pieces. I know this as she told me this later.

A substitute took over her class for 2 months and Ms. Huerta came back. She was frail looking but tried to stay strong. People in the school knew what happened but the principal decided to not tell the students at all. However, somehow they found out. The students started dropping references to trains at every possible time. If Ms. Huerta needed to send someone to the principal, they left making choo-choo sounds and moving like a train engine.

The worst came one day while at her class, a student got some whistles that sounded like the ones on the train and distributed them among his class. They started using them while she was writing on the board and she was unable to hold it. She fell on her knees and started sobbing. The students, instead of showing compassion, started whistling more and more, like animals that know their prey is down and ready to pounce on it. I was walking to my computer lab when I heard the noise. I didn't know what it was but when I saw Ms. Huerta on the floor, I immediately went into the classroom. I saw the students with the whistles and started taking these away. I ordered one of the girls in the class to immediately go to the main office and bring the school nurse, so she could take Ms. Huerta away. She was sobbing and shaking. Her anguished face is still in my mind. It filled me with anger and sadness.

After the nurse took Ms. Huerta away, I decided to talk to the students. I was pissed. However, I didn't want to give in to anger. I asked "Who did this?" but the little cowards didn't want to give anyone away. So, I decided to attack.

"Who has seen a dead body in a movie?"

My question caught them off guard. I asked them to raise their hand if they did and most of them had seen a person killed in a movie. I requested someone to describe how it was and one kid mentioned how somebody got shot and fell down. "Good," I said calmly. "However, those deaths are fake. Death can be messy. In all honesty, and I won't retaliate (I lied), what have you heard about Ms. Huerta's accident?" They only knew the bus she was in was hit by a train. I decided to tell them what happened. I shared some bits of what Ms. Huerta had shared with some of the faculty. How she saw a baby bounce around the bus and see his body get twisted in unnatural ways. How a person's arm snapped away from his body. How a woman shrieked during the whole ordeal until she was crushed to death.

Their faces changed from "Fuck you teacher!" to horror and shame. I told them how Ms. Huerta only broke a couple of fingers but maybe other non-physical things broke that day.

I finished telling them "Ms. Huerta is alive. Be thankful she has enough love for her students to come back after that ordeal."

The students apologized and were more than kind docile after that. Ms. Huerta decided to not continue teaching that year and go into therapy. A couple of their parents got angry at me because they said I traumatized their children with what I said. The principal stood behind me, as she arrived when I was finishing my chat with the students. I stopped teaching after one year to concentrate on teaching adults new technologies. The e-commerce boom was starting and things worked out for me. I saw her once while browsing magazines at store in Mexico. We chatted and she seemed better. She hugged me and thanked me for helping her that time. I still have deep respect for Ms. Huerta. She passed away 2005 after a very bad bout with breast cancer. The library at my former school was renamed after her. |-|

|-| co9hnkn || 24 || Probably going to get buried, but I lecture at a University as a side job to my profession; two classes or so per semester. 

So, right before the winter semester my father passed away suddenly while playing tennis. He was 65.

I was 28 at the time, and I will never forget how hard it was to teach. Not only teach but be engaging, humorous and passionate about my subject. Behind my eyes? I was crippled with depression. It took me until this past year to get over that hump.  

May not seem like a lot given the stories here, but I was surprised I made it through the semester. Then the year.  Then the following year. 

I have never before had to put on an empty smile so hard in my life, but end of the day it is a job. A job I am paid to do. 

It is a job I happen to love.

|-| co9i90b || 23 || So throw away account for too many reasons.

I am a student teacher at this high school that takes students from several counties. When I am not teaching I like to go out on the weekends just like anyone else. Teachers are people too. 

After going to a friends birthday party, getting very drunk, and doing some drugs that I should not have been doing. These drugs made me very "happy." 

My friends and I decide to hit up a local bar where our buddy works in hopes of getting cheaper drinks. 

Well we got the cheaper drinks and now we are even more obliterated than before. I see a very attractive girl who seems to be into me and asks me to buy her a drink. I say "Sure, why not?" and buy the girl a drink. 

THEN SHE SAYS: "THANKS MR. (INSERT LAST NAME HERE).

I shit my pants realizing i just bought a senior student a drink at a bar. She was a new transfer student and I had only taught her once so I truly did not recognize her. After that I went home and could not sleep AT ALL. realizing what I had done more and more as the drugs wore off.

Fast forward to the following Monday and the girl does not say a damn word about it to anyone. Apparently, we "Pinky promised" that she would not say anything and now I feel like the biggest sack of shit to walk the earth. 

Don't hate me. |-|

In High school, we had 2 math teachers. One algebra (girl) and one for geom (guy). We always teased them about being together and whenever they talked to each other there was always this adorable smile between them that showed us they liked each other. One day after Geom class, the guy teacher tells us he is resigning from his job. He tells us that there are some rules that he just doesn't agree with. Turns out, it is against the rules to have a relationship with a co-worker and he ended up quitting so they could be together.

This was 5 years ago and there are some rumors of them getting married :') |-|

|-| co96hhu || 60 || I guess this is semi relevant, but I use to buy weed from, and get high with an elementary school teacher. She was a great teacher, always working on lesson plans and grading papers. She just liked to unwind and relax. She is a single mother of 2 kids with a mortgage and teacher's salary couldn't afford to buy weed. So she sold it to get free weed.

Also, her kids' father was shot and killed a couple years ago during winter break. She said it was hard for her teach. Her class had no idea. She moved 1500 miles away to get away from all the drama and go on with her life.

I fucking HATE the middle school math teacher on my team. She is the most vapid, self-absorbed bitch ever. She's loud and obnoxious. She is generally disliked by everybody on our team and in our school. She has a few friends at work. I don't know how they tolerate her. I'm sure a lot of them put up with her because they don't want to deal with her attitude. The tension in our team meetings is palpable. You can tell every time she opens her mouth, the rest of us just want her to shut up. I'm pretty sure she's getting switched with another math teacher next year. 

So, here's the thing. None of the kids know that the rest of us can't stand her. They think we all get along just fine. And, if she does get moved next year, we will tell the kids that its because the school thought she would be better as a high school teacher. She's not a bad teacher or anything. She's just obnoxious. We've dealt with her for 5 years. It's time for someone else to have their turn. |-| 
|-| co9i050 || 16 || I grew up in a pretty small town, one where everyone knows everyone and their dogs business so it's hard for anything to be kept quiet.  Our middle school principal (when I was a student), who was always such a level headed and nice guy, called the entire school into the assembly hall late one year and made us sit there while he dropped the schools entire collection of calculators out of a box onto the floor and proceeded to kick them around the floor, yelling at us for being so destructive with them and costing the school so much money.  I remember the other teachers sitting behind him bugging their eyes out but not saying anything at all.  That was the beginning of a lot of outbursts, some aimed at students, some at teachers, some at the entire school.  We went off for summer break and when we came back we were informed he'd died of a massive brain haemorrhage.  Turns out he had a nasty brain tumor that he'd hidden from the entire faculty that had caused the huge change in his personality. |-|

She also signed off on long term sick leave but still gave private singing lessons to school students (against the rules). She had and still has a bit of a reputation in some circles, but she was very good at making friends and getting people on her side. They eventually managed to get rid of her after it emerged that she'd been fiddling coursework results, but she decided to take the school to court for unfair dismissal.

I had no idea how much the students knew when I was there, but it kinda went without saying that you don't discuss it with them. |-|

|-| co97txe || 20 || My AP chemistry teacher in high school had a 12 year old daughter with leukemia.  She would drive 5 hours every weekend for treatment, and I'm sure it was on her mind at all hours of the day, but she was still one of the best teachers I've ever had.  It wasn't a secret from any of the students, but not once did she let it affect her work. |-| 
|-| co9extv || 21 || Considering how many posts are from students or former students, it seems like teachers aren't very good at hiding things from their classes. |-| 
|-| co9ddtz || 12 || One of the Italian teachers that I had in HS got fired.  When she didn't come to class a teacher covering for her said she was sick and going to be out for the rest of the school year.  Then when we got a preeminent sub there was a different excuse.  I found out from my sister, who found out from one of her really good friends who keeps in touch with one of the other foreign language teachers.  The Italian teacher used fund raised money to fly an Italian exchange student from Italy all the way to where we are because two of the students fell in love during the exchanges. 
 |-| 
|-| co9e1z5 || 11 || We know who the actual shitty teachers are and as professionals have to keep a straight face in front of kids. |-| 
|-| co9fy99 || 11 || I get this is late, but I have a relevant story so IDGAF.

Not a teacher, but at my intermediate school our principle was married to the art teacher, and about halfway through the year the entire school eventually found out that the principle was screwing the music teacher. Everybody (even the art teacher) knew by the end of the year and the principle was sacked. Nobody missed him, he did a rubbish job of running the school, which has massively improved since the new principle arrived (turns out that the dude was apparently spending a good deal of the school budget on staff offices and the staff-room. Wouldn't be surprised to learn if some of it was going into his back pocket either.) |-| 
|-| co9hqmm || 11 || Not a teacher but in my 9th grade year of highschool we had this awesome physics teacher Mr.Stalter. Super nice, super funny, always had loads of kids from other grades coming back and bringing him food, talking to him, the works. He was awesome and he was an amazing teacher.

So the year before I had came when I would have been in 8th grade near the end of the year, his wife died. This absolutely tore him apart, he was madly in love. He even in my 9th grade year would come up to us occasionally and just say how happy he was that we were all in his life, and he thinks he would have gone insane if he had quit. 

So 9th grade year he meets a lady about halfway~ through the year, and it starts off slow but they eventually hit it off. He comes to the conclusion that he's going to ask her to marry him, and I still to today think it was partly love, and partly not wanting to be alone in that house anymore. He and his daughter had become really close over this time, and they met up weekly and she was very excited for him to give it a shot. I remember he brought in the ring he was going to propose to her with too, and all we did that day was talk about her and how it was going to be great. (While working on our physics packets so we weren't being completely unproductive.)

So he ends up proposing to her over the summer on a vacation to the Florida Keys, and she says yes and they set the plans for the marriage and everything looks awesome for him. His daughter and him were finally truly starting to get over it after two years, and they were moving forward together with this new companion on their journey. 

10th grade starts, and I go down to his classroom after school to see him and how his trip went! We were super close so I thought it would be cool to see how it all had gone and get some updates. So I walk in front of his class, and find it with a young man at the helm. I go and ask him where Mr.Stalter was, and if he was a student teacher for the semester. Turns out, Mr.Stalter had died the week before school started from a stroke. 

I still have no idea how his daughter is doing, and how the nice lady he was talking to is holding up. Hell, most of the kids at that highschool still don't even know today what happened to him. I miss Mr.Stalter. |-|

A few from Japan:

1. The middle school 3rd graders (North American equivalent of grade 8 or 9) always do a year-end class trip to Okinawa over a long weekend. This one particular year, the class had a special needs kid whom we were worried might flip out on the plane ride (and he was a big boy).  

Anyway, we had to figure out how to change the trip without the kids knowing it was because of their special needs classmate. Ultimately we decided to use the swine flu outbreak at the time as a pretext to keep the trip more local. IIRC, they went to Tokyo Disneyland, so it worked out.

2. Two teachers were shacked up and we had to keep it absolutely quiet from the Board, students and parents (otherwise one would be transfered).  Only once they were engaged could it be talked about.

3. Teachers in my town lived in a dorm. Apparently a middle school teacher and an elementary school teacher got into a brawl over the former's use of bug spray in the dorm (ES teacher recently had a baby and was worried about it being poisoned). That was one the kiddies could never hear about.

Canada one (as a student) :

I had a high school music teacher who was super nice and generally happy-go-lucky, but one semester he was a wreck. Swearing at students, crying, and I swear I could smell booze on him. 

Found out later it was just a lot of personal stuff (disabled in-laws moved in, had trouble conceiving with his wife (also a teacher at the same school), etc..).  I suppose he didn't hide it that well though. |-| 
|-| co9egub || 9 || literally having a nervous breakdown for months straight and kept up teaching. got decent reviews. very little memory of that time |-| 
|-| co9b9v3 || 16 || In seventh grade, we all got stuck outside for three hours during a "fire drill" and it went through lunch.  We found out later that day that it was a bomb threat and the teachers weren't supposed to tell us.

My freshman year of high school I took a drama class, halfway through the semester, the teacher never showed up and we had a substitute and we were told he was sick and that our teacher would be back.  He was really good friends with a senior in our class and so she knew what happened.  A couple weeks before the class was over, she told me that he was bipolar and forgot his medicine and snapped at a class.  He was fired on the spot and the class was told not to talk about it.

I had a teacher sophomore year that used to tell us about some of the things that happened around the school that the teachers were supposed to hide from us.  

She told us that one day she had walked into her classroom early in the morning to find two students having sex in her classroom in the dark.

There was also a fight between two girls a few years before that resulted in one of them ripping the shirt and bra off the other and she refused to cover up when she was sent to the principal's office and it was early morning when parents were dropping their kids off.

My school had a trip where you traveled through Europe and learned about WWII and on the first night, the teachers walked in on ten of the twenty students drinking in a bar.  Those students were suspended for two weeks and not allowed to walk at graduation.  It became really controversial because the teachers weren't allowed to drink either so they shouldn't have walked into the bar.

We also had a trip to Scotland where you went to live with a student in Scotland for two weeks and then they came to live with you.  There were always a couple stories that came out of that and the year I went on the trip, I was one of them.  I was drunk and making out with a Scottish girl that was sitting on my lap at a party and that's how everyone found out we were kinda a thing.  Don't take that as bragging, she was my first kiss and it was a few weeks before I turned 17.  But she and I are still good friends.

On that trip, one of the chaperones brought a suitcase full of scotch back, which she wasn't actually supposed to do because alcohol wasn't allowed at all on that trip.

Both the chaperones knew about a party we all went to where there was alcohol, one of the teachers told me if they didn't see it, they didn't have to report it, so they chose to let us have our fun.

They also knew about my relationship with that girl because one of them saw us kiss once, which we were told before we went that "sexual relations" weren't allowed, but instead they just talked to each other about how cute it was.

My junior year in high school, someone got a video of a freshman girl giving a handjob to a guy in class and gave the video to the principal.

That same year, a freshman girl got caught dealing drugs, got her phone taken by the principal and everyone she had texted about it got in trouble.

My senior year, the teacher that used to tell us stories got fired because of a drug addiction.

Now that I wrote all that out, I realize my school was full of drama. |-| 
|-| co9enmr || 8 || A student found nudes of our chorus teacher on his personal computer that he brought with him everyday. Idk why he just let this kid use his personal computer but he got fired and moved out of state. I saw the pic and let me just say daaaaaaayum but I feel kinda bad for him.  |-| 
|-| co9f5gg || 8 || College instructor here. Some typical stuff:

* There are always gossipy faculty who talk shit about staff and students.

* Tenured Professor So-and-So with multiple degrees and accolades, is really racist

* Your adjunct professors are highly qualified, experienced, and caring (mostly).  Yeah, they earn less than 15K per year.  

The most absurd thing occurred a few years back.  The internet was down for several days on the entire campus.  IT Dept couldn't figure it out.  The main modem/router device was broken.  They had to call AT&amp;T and wait two days for a replacement.   |-| 
|-| co9e881 || 22 || The teacher that molested kids. Didn't come out till I was in 5the grade but when it did women from college and above were coming out of the wood work to say he had molested them and no one believed them or the school covered it up. Reading the court transcripts, the allegations were true and the school had known about it since the nineties but never really did anything to stop him. 

Form what I've heard from parents and teachers, when Kids in 4th grade where evaluated, they would give him 80% boys 20%girls, and the Girls were typically the smallest and least developed in the grade. However a lot can change over the summer between 4th and 5th grade or even during the year. Inevitably one girl would be chosen and he would molest her throughout the school year.chis classroom was designed to allow him maximum discrepancy. All the teachers knew and talked bout it. He was the only male black teacher in the white female staff which contributed largely to him getting away with it. |-| 
|-| co9e7i4 || 50 || I made a throwaway for obvious reasons.  I almost kinda hope nobody sees this but I was reading through this thread like "that's all you got?" Let me start by saying, I'm a great teacher.  I get excellent reviews.  I love the craft of teaching, I love the topic that I teach because I believe it is important.  I love kids and I'm really good at my job.  Now that this is out of the way let me explain.  If most of the people I work with, or the parents of my kids knew the things I did after work, no one would ever let me near a child.   Ok, so first of all I do a ton of drugs. Mostly weed, and alcohol but I go through binges of coke and mdma. I used to sell drugs as well, for a while just small amounts at parties but eventually I started moving pounds, but it got super dangerous so I had to stop.  I've come in to teach after a night of all-night partying, drinking, drugs and sex and nobody noticed.  I've never been high or drunk at work but I've sure as shit have had some of the worst hangovers and have had to maintain some distance between myself and coworkers and students because I was pretty much sweating cocaine and whiskey.  I've gone to work with a black eye multiple times from bar fights and had to say I fell in the shower or something like that.  It gets funny to me sometimes when kids ask me questions about sex and drugs (I teach health) and they're trying to shock me or stump me because they think I'm a huge nerd and I just answer them with a straight face and scientifically accurate explanations, but in the back of my head I'm thinking, "Also, I've done that."  I'm always composed at work and I treat all my kids with respect and genuinely want them to grow up to be healthy and amazing adults and I work with a lot of teachers who are pretty much straight edge but are total shitbags to their kids, slack on their job, create problems with coworkers etc.  **TLDR** I teach but I also have a wild party/drug/sex life and I have to hide that part of myself because society thinks that makes me a bad person, but I'm still very good at my job so, I disagree. |-| 
|-| co9keo4 || 8 || My first year teaching, a 5th grade boy with downs syndrome stopped showing up for school one week (he'd missed a few days with no notice from mom). Concerned, the vice principal, school counselor &amp; social worker called home repeatedly - no answer. They decided to make a house call, and they found the boy in the kitchen looking disheveled, dirty, and clearly very hungry. Turns out his mother had died in her bedroom several days earlier and he was alone and hungry for the entire time. My class kept asking what had happened because the special ed teacher was sobbing all day. It was awful:-( I could go on, but would probably need to make a throwaway... |-| 
|-| co9n7ou || 7 || Throwaway but.....

I will always feel bad for my teachers who had to deal with all the gang activity at my school. 

Having to essentially push aside the fact that the kid that would leave class randomly was going to do a hit or beat up someone for some of the higher up kids. he always said he "had to go to the bathroom for awhile" but we all knew what he was doing.

Or the teachers that would break up fights in the cafeteria. Or dear jesus the five police officers who stood guard around school, possibly the coolest cops I've ever known.

Or to be able to deal with the tension in classes when there were rival gangs/families, where one wrong sentence could result in a fight or a shootout. Having to manage a bunch of throwaway kids, who grew up in the worst parts of Baltimore, essentially grew up in a gang.

Or knowing that every kid in the class was packing either a knife, brass knuckles or a gun. Or all three. And the guns could range from pistols, to disassembled rifles. 

Or that the kid sitting in the back was the son of a mob boss or a hitman, or an in general member of a gang. I can't imagine trying to make seating charts in some of my classes, trying to make sure all the right kids sat in the right places. 

Or having to just keep on teaching as we listened to gunshots, all of us wondering who it was this time. Having to try to disregard some kid finding out it was his brother, or sister or friend or bf/gf and breaking down in class. One of our teachers would Stop class so he/she could sob over it and make all us listen to it, make us think about it, and she would always say "Imagine it being your *insert relationship to victim*"

Or when the Russian Thug kid got called out for being a punk in class by my science teacher and he stood up and pulled a gun on him, with all of us putting our hands on ours, and him standing there, chalk in hand and said the words I'll never forget "Do it, shoot me, I've been ready to die sense I accepted this job, but I accepted it to help kids like you, kids who don't want to deal with their problems, who just shoot away anyone who hates them, instead of fixing the reasons everyone hates them" That was the changing moment for me, that's when I realized I had to change how my life was going. The Russian kid just stood there, staring at him, and then set the gun on the desk, and our teacher shook his head and sighed then just went back to teaching. That man was the toughest motherfucker I've ever met. How he never got gunned down still confuses me.

I will always love the teachers that helped us and treated us like normal people and not just like criminals. They related to us and steered us in the right direction and got most of us out of the gang life. The teachers who would stay after and help us with our problems, not just school work, but actual life shit. Or the teachers that would call out the most thug kids in school with no fear at all. There were teachers at that school who treated us like shit, and that's why we keyed their cars, slashed their tires, trashed their classrooms and disrespected them in class (which I now see was just our way of expressing anger). Those teachers made me see that life wasn't all about the family and protecting my brothers, that maybe there was more to life than a life or crime.

I cannot imagine the kind of behind the scenes shit that went down with those teachers.
 |-| 
|-| co974yi || 8 || In 1st grade my teacher told everyone in class she was pregnant. A couple months later  she was talking with my mom, and told her she had a miscarriage. 

Obviously kids in the class didn't know and wouldn't understand if she told them, since they were too young. 

I felt bad for her at the time - but when I got a bit older I realized how much it must have hurt her when kids would come up asking her when she was going to have her baby. |-| 
|-| co9axzx || 6 || I would like to tell a short story about my Science teacher in High School.She was a tough women that served in some form in the Korean war. Well one day she found out that her son committed suicide. She came back to teach a week after and shown no sign of sadness while teaching. She was a huge bitch and was one of those people that tell people "Why are you sad? You have it better than most people in this world." As ignorant as that statement is it holds a lot of true to it especially known that she has seem some shit. But I will always respect her. |-| 
|-| co9b666 || 5 || Not a teacher (yet) but back in high school our principal and guidance counselor quit at the same time. No one knew exactly why until the end of the year when a teacher let slip that they were altering the grades of seniors to let them graduate.  |-| 
|-| co9eqq4 || 6 || I substitute for special ed classes and I'll often watch over one of my students in a mainstream class. Some mainstream teachers aren't very kind and will make jokes about the students right in front of them, as if the students are too stupid to realize they're being made fun of. As a substitute I'd never feel comfortable calling the teacher out, and I don't ever get time with the teachers without the students there. I usually just ignore the comment, and if my student asks to clarify what the teacher said, I'll make it sound like we were discussing something they'd have no interest in or they referenced something the kid wouldn't get or something.  |-| 
|-| co9hyei || 6 || I taught my entire first year without a certification.... I was also sleeping with the assistant principal |-| 
|-| co9kj6t || 7 || I had an amazing art teacher through 3rd grade to my senior year (very small rural school) who kindled an ongoing passion for art in me. I knew this lady better than I know a lot of my own family. She seriously took an interest in me and a lot of other "trouble" kids and helped us find an outlet.

When I was about 15, her son died. He was a pilot in training in the USAF, and crashed during a training flight due to mechanical error, killing him and the instructor. She was gone from class for a month,  and when she returned you could hardly tell she was upset at all. A couple days later, I was going to clean my brushes off before leaving and she was there, scrubbing the other students' brushes off when she just dropped all of them and braced herself on the sink. I asked what was wrong, and she said "It just hits me sometimes, you know?" This super strong, happy woman was getting ready to cry, and I couldn't have handled it, so I hugged her and told her it was okay, that she'd get through it. 

And that's what Mrs. Robbins truly did for me. The feeling I got from hugging her and telling her everything would be okay when I knew she was dying inside is the best feeling I've ever had in my life, because she smiled, wiped her eyes, and carried on like her son would have wanted. I felt like I made a difference in her life, and that feeling of empathy and compassion has been with me since. 

Thanks, Mrs. Robbins.  |-| 
|-| co9a8tn || 11 || Not a teacher, but when I was a freshman a senior had committed suicide. He was actually my brother's friend and always seemed happy so no one saw it coming. Anyway, the student was  the son of one of the teachers so it was no surprise she was gone for about 6 months to grieve. When she came back she was clearly not the same and had so many emotional issues(understandably so).  I cant imagine what it must be like for a parent to go through that and then to go back to teaching all these kids that were actually his friends.   
  
This one isn't really behind the scenes but about a year later, a junior had committed suicide.  I actually knew him pretty well and had hung out with him a couple times, They had called us in the gym pretty much the same way they did when they announced the death of the senior the year before so everyone instantly knew something was wrong.   
  
Keep in the mind, this is a small all male catholic school run by monks with less than 500 students so it was very easy to get to know most of the kids in the school. So when they announced it, so many people just broke down crying right there. Much of the school seemed depressed and emotionally distraught for a long period of time. It was very sad and I hope I don't have to experience anything like that again. |-| 
|-| co97nbp || 11 || I really hate some of my co-workers. When they ask about their teachers from past/future, sometimes it is hard not to say I flat out hate their guts. |-| 
|-| co9aezr || 5 || Not a teacher but I got to hear about a lot of going ons of the teachers because I friends with many. I've always made better friends with older people than people my age bi hated the majority of the idiots I was forced to be around in high school anyways. 

Story one. Apparently child pedos are somewhat a problem around here. One found their way onto school grounds and was caught talking to some 8th grade boys or freshman. There was an incident where he was forward with them and campus police found them. I can't recall the grade. The middle school was down the road. Anyways we come back from winter break and suddenly everybody has to wear necklace id tags to show they belong there. Everybody asked but no reason was ever formally given. Had to wear them the next 3 and a half years. Hated the fuck out of those things. Makes you feel like a dog. 

Story two was suddenly out of nowhere the superintendent was budget cutting and starts forcing teachers to retire early or they lose their pension. I don't know how he went about it but we lost like 4 teachers. 3 of which I had. One was forced to retire halfway thru school year in December. She got replaced with some idiot. She told us the only reason she got the job was because she was the only one who applied. Anyways she doesn't know what she's teaching so she comes in at 6am everyday to get taught the lesson she will then teach to all of Chemistry AP. Everyone starts failing. I drop the course with many others to go down to reg chem where I could actually pass now. A month later the new teacher is quietly let go and the AP courses are combined now. She got fired for handing the answers out to everything. 

Story 3 halfway thru school the principal got let to and replaced with a living copy of the Mr Clean guy. He was in his late 50s recently divorced and married some girl early 20s he used to teach old enough to be his daughter and they had kids around 6 years old. He was odd. Also a shit parent. I bussed at a local restaurant. They would come in and he and that girl let their little shits take the butter and ketchup and various other things into a nice thick paste and rub it all over the table and stick shit in it. Who let's their kids do that like fuck. I had to clean it almost every time and they didn't fucking tip. Shitty parents. 

 |-| 
|-| co9bt5z || 7 || Had to reapply for my own job each of the years I taught. A colleague was both applying for my job and on the board doing the interviews for the position (yes, I debated suing the school over this and other violations). He ended up hiring a woman to one of the two positions available and subsequently had an affair with her, then divorced his wife and married her. That was but a wee drop in the bucket that was crazy at that school.  |-| 
|-| co9cn60 || 10 || My ex-husband called me 5 minutes before my first class of second graders came in for art to tell me he was leaving me and moving out of our place as we spoke on the phone. Somehow I was able to not completely break down. I hung up the phone, accepted the class probably white in the face from shock, and then called the office and asked for a sub. The secretary was great and kept the secret from everyone. She told the sub I was really sick. |-| 
|-| co9djaf || 4 || Ive got too many weird behind the scene's shit from my school days, but the one that really sticks in my mind is a teacher that im gonna call Mr. Perv. 
Mr. Perv was an old, balding man with a squinty eye like popeye.

Anyway on my first day of class with Mr. Perv he made all of us line up and took photos of all of us. 
Assuming this was something to do with class i didnt think much of it at the time, but the thing is we never actually saw those pictures.

That in of itself isnt enough to warrent me writing a comment though. The thing is when i was about 15, he tried to organise a camping trip to the Brecon Beacons, which is a mountain range in Wales.

Even this isnt that weird but then you have to factor in the boys he asked on this trip, which was a very select bunch. Consisting of all the smaller quieter more feminine boys.. and no one else.. No other pupils. No staff. Just him and a bunch of weedy lads off in a mountain range together in the middle of buttfuck wales. Alone.

Oh and he didnt bother to inform the school or any of the boys parents about the trip either and was only found out when one of the boys told his parents about it. 

He was quietly asked to leave.

Bullshit ino, but my school was fucked up..
  |-| 
|-| co9e1ln || 4 || My boss (the principal) is screwing around with one of the teacher assistants. He's married and most people in the school know this.  |-| 
|-| co9e7ay || 4 || This is hard one to describe without giving away too much about others affected in the story.  This person was a serious influence in my schooling.  From a Teacher super believing in me even though i had bad grades, to me being her TA to stay out of trouble. And lastly having a chance at employment and working 2 years in a very technical role with the school. 

While i was employed, i was overseeing a spam box on the schools network.  One day a fat fingered address  (to the superintendent of the district) email was in it, from the 1st year acting principal, asking to fire this person who I mentioned earlier. She is claiming that this woman was intimidating her during this first year in such a way, that she feels like she will never be as welcomed or liked as this person with the students and teachers. Trust me when i tell you, this is some crazy talk. 

 The superintendent responded basically saying that this person had been in the district so long that he could not do that, that the worst she could do was demote the person to a former position. That position, being mine. :(.  The transition took 2 months (till the end of the school year). I was laid off on the teacher work day following the last day of school. I came in late on purpose, and i shit you not the principal was gone by then getting a boob job, reduction or some something. This amazing influence of mine being the one to tell me the bad news in which i already knew.  I made it about 100ft out the front of that school before i turned around and went back, describing the email caught in spam, and what was happening (having not been demoted yet).  Of all things, the person actually didnt believe me.  I remember being said "why are you doing this, it sucks, just let it go".  
Well.....It happened, and the person was put in my job eventually making enough moves to get promoted on a district level. And i love my job, so its kinda happily ever after.  I actually of all things go to lunch every couple months with this person as i am preparing to do some volunteering and setting up a small scholarship. I owe it to the school.

I hid a lot with that whole ordeal around that school.  2 months worth.   I ran a club at the school so i was kinda personal with some kids.  That was tough,  staying neutral in front of them and everyone else. I kinda deserved to get fired (bad 2 months in my life, call it a breakup), so i let it happen.  I dont know what id do if i did it again. Got a few life lessons out of that one.   

That was hard as shit to make anonymous. |-| 
|-| co9fbs3 || 5 || 1. First week of teaching 2nd period. Student walks in dressed as the grim reaper brandishing a pistol. I calmly walk over to him and demand the gun, expecting to be shot. He is super embarrassed and hands it to me. I take it to the principal with the student. Both principal and head counselor brush it off. Teacher who gave student instructions to both dress as death and bring a fake pistol for her, 'forensics' class hates me for the rest of my time at the school and tries to get me fired for making her look bad.


2. 2nd year, 2nd week, student goes into bathroom puts up an out of order sign and slits wrists. He doesn't die, stumbles out of class and into principal's office. Principal calls parents to pick him up- not cops. She then calls me in- it was my prep period and has me clean up the blood, belt with student's bite marks, and out of order sign. She instructs me to tell no one, it is a family matter.

3. The remainder of the year principal shits in faculty bathroom during first period like fucking clockwork- it reeks of Chardonnay and sadness every time. It got so bad that it was downright shameful. 

The students never knew any of this.

Tl/dr; Principal didn't do shit, didn't know shit, made the worst shits- students didn't give a shit.

|-| co9gkzg || 4 || In high school I had a male teacher who left halfway through the year. I didnt learn until after I graduated that he had been fired due to claims of sexual harassment by a freshman girl. The kicker? Years later she admitted that she had only accused him as revenge for a bad test grade. He was a well liked teacher, but to my knowledge has not been able to find a teaching job since. However I believe he received some money from the school and the court that convicted him on little to no evidence |-| 
|-| co9h7ph || 4 || I got fired for jerking off at work as a teacher. |-| 
|-| co9h9mq || 4 || I doubt this'll get seen, but I found my drama teacher's cocaine with my humanities teacher.

Ian (fake name), my humanities teacher, got a call from my drama teacher, John (fake), to go and get bags of makeup for him from his office (closet sized with shit tons of dresses, costumes, and bags in it (he directed 10+ performances per year)). In class we were working on a writing assignment and I was the only one obviously not working, so Ian pulled me out to go find makeup. After finding a couple bags, I came across one that had a big beat up altoids container in it, and as I was reaching down to grab it I told Ian "There's a 50/50 chance this has drugs in it". Lo and behold, there were 5 or 6 tiny bags that had remnants of white powder in it. Ian just licked his pinky, stuck it in one of the bags and then tasted it, shaking his head saying it wasn't cocaine and we carried on packing stuff up.

The next day Ian pulled me out of my first period class, and on the way to his classroom I said, "It was cocaine, wasn't it?". He said it was, but that now he doesn't know what to do and that I seriously need to keep quiet while he figures out what to do. (John is the son of the principle and art teacher, meanwhile Ian was a new teacher that year.)

I'm really not sure what ended up happening though. |-| 
|-| co9hdgr || 5 || Only story I have is sort of boring but I'll share it anyway. Not a teacher, but I was always fairly close to my high school and college teachers. After I graduated High School, my band teacher would always have alumni come play in the winder concert and get dessert after to catch up and what have you. Well, about 3 years ago he was on the verge of being fired because the board was cutting funding to the arts programs. Every single one of his students (including me) wrote a letter to the board explaining why they should keep him. That winter concert, he was doing his little speech at the beginning and when he got to the possibility of leaving the school, we all started chanting his name. He starting crying onstage from all the support. His wife later told us that he had to read the copies he got of the letters in chunks because he would keep getting emotional. He still teaches music. |-| 
|-| co9hrmh || 5 || A bit late to the party, but whatever.

Not a teacher, but a janitor at an elementary school. A while back, some random guy found his way into the school and hung himself in the kindergarten classroom. EMTs quickly came, cleaned up the mess, and left before school even started for the day, and I don't think any parents were ever told about the incident. |-| 
|-| co9htd2 || 4 || I worked in a SEVERELY underprivileged inner-city school for a short period of time. If ANYONE, my kids, parents, or any community stakeholder really had any idea of HALF the stuff that went on in that school...nothing would have happened because those communities don't have the proper resources to litigate OR self-advocate. But in a non-destitute neighborhood, the school would have been shut down and burned down.

Teaching absolutely destroyed my naive belief in the American dream. |-| 
|-| co9j620 || 4 || My father was one of the associative principal of my high school. Basically, that means that since the school was so big, each grade had a principal with one of those being the head school principal. They all handled discipline and other school related matters.  

He told me everything, and I mean everything except maybe their names unless it was all obvious. Anyways, last year around this time the principal was escorted out of the school building. He was in his 70's and was prime for retirement. And one day he was just escorted out of the place by the police. His job was terminated after 30 something years. 

And the kicker is no one knows why. Not even my father. But it was for something decently big. It was so bad that he couldn't even enter the school building and we had to hand deliver his mail and papers to him. 

Obviously rumors flew like crazy; he was senile and unfit to teach, he was a pedophile who finally got caught, etc. etc. Either way, every time my father was asked he couldn't tell them. He even had to deflect questions and rumors from teachers. 

I still have no idea what he did, but people still ask my father about it. 

---

But then we get teachers who get seemingly fired out of the blue. Essentially, a science teacher allowed his students to go crazy all hour and one of the kids made a ninja throwing star out of exacto blades and duct tape. Most kids in the class figured that's the straw that broke the camels' back, but we still couldn't technically say the precise reason why he was fired. 

Oh, last semester there was this couple who got in an argument in the parking lot. She tried to hit him because he was getting physical. He grabbed her, dragged her to his car, and drove off. He was charged with attempted kidnapping and assault or something similar. 

I've got stories like these for days of every shade and color.  |-| 
|-| co9kcui || 5 || Im a student that got some details of a crazy incident from my former teacher 

So we're in class doing our work like normal and my teacher, lets call him Mr.B is just siting at his desk doing teacher things. Our school was pretty big ,2 stories, and had two long hallways filled with class rooms. So we're all just working/ talking when suddenly we all hear some yelling in the distance, not common for our school. Then loud foot steps, almost stomping, as he races past our room. Mr. B gets up and chases after him like a bat out of hell. I don't how how we all remained seated, but a good 5 minutes later Mr.B comes back and with the sternest voice I've ever heard from him say "you have work to do, sit down shut up and finish it." And so we did. A few months  pass and im talking to Mr. B ( i have a closer relationship to him than most students) and we start talking about what happened. Apparently the kid running had just been dumped by his girlfriend and was running to the window at the end of the hall to jump out and kill himself. Luckily mr. B said that he grabbed him by the belt as he had one led already out of the window. He yanked him back and took him to the office where the paramedics took him to the hospital for some reason? Mr. B said that within a few weeks after the incident the boy tried to kill himself 3 separate times before finally giving up and moving on. He came to school the next day and thanked Mr. B for saving his life. I know the kid and he seems happier now. Ill never forget what Mr. B did for him. |-| 
|-| co9j28m || 9 || This will probably get buried but what the hell. I'm not a teacher, but I will answer on behalf of one of my high school math teachers. 

She was an extremely androgynous woman, and everyone assumed she was gay. Somehow I knew she wasn't. She had gotten married earlier that year, and showed us pictures of her wedding. In all the pictures she showed us, the other bride/groom was never present. 

That year, I lost my shit in her class because my mom was in the hospital and very close to death. She dismissed class 20 minutes early and we had a heart to heart. She sobbed as she confided in me that her mom had died of brain cancer just a few weeks ago, and that her husband died when the chemical factory he was working in exploded just a few weeks after they were married. 

This woman taught *every single class* with a smile.  |-| 
|-| co9fdgx || 22 ||    Okay so this thread is fucking depressing, so I'll tell you a little story that I'm still quite proud of. 
So there was a very young Teacher that started my Senior year of high school. I didn't have her, but mannnnn, did I know who she was. She wasn't a day over 23, just fresh out of college and this was her first job as a Teacher. There was only one problem with this Teacher though. She was honestly a straight bitch, she clearly didn't want to be a Teacher in the slightest. It took 3 years before the school finally got rid of her and it was due to her bragging about giving lower grades to students she didn't care for. My buddy who was dyslexic actually had her for English and he did not like reading aloud in front of the class. It was embarrassing for him, because he would get really nervous and would just stutter constantly. He could read fine to himself and he was wicked smaht, but just had trouble when put on the spot. 

   So fast forward a year and a half after high school, I was almost 20 and had dropped a ton of weight/grew facial hair. It was a goatee back then; beards weren't really a thing yet. 

   There was a bar on the outskirts of town where the owner knew my friend and let us drink there in spite of our age. We walk in one night around 11 or so and who should be sitting at the bar you ask? That's right, hot Teacher. Now it wasn't that I was shy necessarily I just hadn't had a lot of practice with women. See, I had lost over 80 pounds and so I wasn't used to women finding me very attractive. Well my buddy decided unbeknownst to me that he was going to try and fuck this teacher that night. So we're playing pool and getting all liquored up when this teacher and her friends (2 females) come wandering over to us (my buddy didn’t even have to try it would seem)  She didn't recognize me nor my friend (not the same friend who had her for English by the way) and asked me, not my friend but me if they could play with us. So we start playing pool and dammnnn is this Teacher layin it on thick with the flirting but not with my buddy but me, ME! Even my normally oblivious ass knew what she was after. My buddy was alright with that though because he had some little competition thing going on with the other two (never have understood that about women, why they become competitive over an average looking guy). The Teacher asks me if I want to buy her another drink, so I oblige and head toward the bar with her only to be turned around and slammed right into the wall in the corner. She comes at me like a cat in heat and who was I to complain, right? So things are getting hot and heavy, so before long she invites my buddy and me back to her place. We naturally say yes without a second thought. 

Fast forward 20 intense minutes later with her all over me in the back seat of the car and we pull into her driveway. We go inside the house and she looks at her friends and my buddy and says "condoms are in the kitchen drawer, good night." She drags me back to her room, I thought I was going to fall over she pulled so hard. We get in there and she pulls that whole, I just want to freshen up thing. So I'm lying there on her bed just thinking about what I'm about to do. I thought about my buddy and how embarrassed he was in her class, the way she always treated students with disrespect. This is going to be beautiful I thought, I still know people that go there and all of the kids still can’t stand her ass. This will get around the school and she’ll experience a cock punch of karma right to her uterus! Yes siree, I'm lying on the bed with this smug shit eating grin on my face until the bathroom door flies open. She literally runs at me and jumps what seemed like 20 feet to land right on top of me. She is completely naked and we just go wild on each other.
 Something happened though that night, after we had sex we were both pretty sober or at least sober enough. We laid in each other’s arms and just talked for what seemed like days. Though, we eventually did fall asleep as the sun started to come up. I woke up next to her and I remember the way the sun lit her face through the windows, she looked almost angelic. I had lost any dislike I had for her and discovered that deep down she was actually a good person. 

   In fact, she's still lying next to me as I type this story now ten years later. I'm going to give my wife a kiss and call it a night boys and girls. For the record, she did eventually realize how big of a bitch she was as a teacher and that she taught at my school while I was there. Just not before she got shit canned, she works in HR for a decent company now and she's still kind of a bitch but I love her anyway. I just love the way she looks at me with those big dough eyes and though I find it kind of annoying when she looks at me and asks for about tree fiddy. She's such a greedy bitch.
 |-| 
|-| co96ble || 9 || Not a teacher. BUT one day in high school one of our female teachers slapped another female teacher and had a bit of a screaming match. Never found out what it was over.  |-| 
|-| co9af11 || 4 || We had to call CPS for a little girl in my class. I heard about all the abuse she went through at home and then watched her get bullied at school but I couldn't say anything. |-| 
|-| co9b626 || 3 || At my elementary school the summer before I entered 3rd grade, my Principal and vice-principal were both fired. The principal had stolen ~$20,000 from the district so she could buy herself shoes and stuff (I heard she had some sort of mental problem that made her *need* to buy clothes and stuff I guess). She was arrested and I don't know what happened to her, I think she was locked up for some time though. My vice-principal, that same summer, was busted for being an escort. Her fake name was "Taya Taylor" and she had a website and everything. I believe she was just fired but did not face legal problems. Turned out they turned each other in as they both knew what the other person was doing. Keep in mind, these were K-5 principles. |-| 
|-| co9bj76 || 3 || When I was in 11th grade my Latin teacher went to England for the December break. Apparently she had been talking to this man for hours every lunch break she had for years. This guy she was talking to was part of her wedding. She left her husband and moved to England over the break to marry this other guy. Her ex husband then came into our class and explained everything and was crying and shit. It was very fucked up.  |-| 
|-| co9bvgd || 4 || 10+ year teacher here. I've been a functional alcoholic most of that time. The rest of the time I went to AA. The drama is of my own making but it is difficult coming up with yet another excuse why I'm red faced and exhausted at school. The students definitely notice.   |-| 
|-| co9c96f || 4 || Over the summer I did a lot of work with our school's (community college) tutoring program where I sat in all day and managed the desk. Our program advisor was leaving in a month and was so done with the entire place she told me some of the stuff that was going on, and a lot of it was centered around a string of firings that happened.

A small group of people, still in power and milking it for every ounce they can, fired off about six employees at the school, all medium to high ranking individuals. The thing all of them had in common is that they were part of that "we keep things running around this shit show" crowd, and they were pretty good at it because about two years ago our entire office staff retired early when they realized they majorly fucked up everything to do with the paperwork they were supposed to keep up.

They got rid of all these people because right now they've intentionally created this extremely vauge area in how federal, state, and local funds can be used to finance a large change to the tutoring program, involving construction/computer/new furniture mainly. The same people in charge of distributing the money are the same people in charge of deciding how much money they get and also every purchasing record.

In short: they are playing with a lot of cash with no oversight because they got rid of everyone who was watching.

Now there's federal investigators wandering around and I've heard from a few teachers who've just been watching, misuse of the particular fund we recieve could mean federal prison time. |-| 
|-| co9e7h3 || 4 || Social Studies teacher here - work at a small private school with both middle and high school classes. The very married  P.E. Teacher/Volley Ball coach was constantly hitting on me, texting me about his children and then throwing in the "we should have lunch to talk about this more" line, and visiting my room during planning. I called him out for his behavior. He quit two months later. The kids have no idea.  |-| 
|-| co9ey67 || 3 || Not teacher, but student.  Our guidance counselor taught sex ed.   He used his own story about his own vasectomy, explaining how it worked.  Very helpful and informative, and we actually liked that he did it.   Then we found out that his wife, who worked in the office, got pregnant.  They tried to keep it on the DL with no luck.  Next year he was back, she was not, and they were getting a divorce.   |-| 
|-| co9f8i3 || 4 || Had a teacher for 10th grade English. Strange guy, the class was a joke and his teaching was sub-par at best. No one really got along with him, he didn't seem to like anyone and class was constantly a battle. We knew he had a wife and kids, but was divorced. One day he came in with a bruised and battered face with a weak story as a cover up. No one knew the truth, but we all had a very eerie and uneasy feeling about it. Not long after, we had a substitute on a Monday morning. Following day we came in and found out he died. Just like that. They wouldn't tell us anything besides his death announcement. Made us all really think, what a bunch of dicks we all were to him. He may not have been the greatest, but I've no doubt had the class acted differently towards him he'd still be alive today. Poor bastard killed himself. I was pretty high up there on his list of trouble makers, he and I were constantly going at it. I don't remember my last words to him, and I don't want to. Makes me feel terrible to think about.  |-| 
|-| co9fngy || 4 || Teacher had to quit because she was impregnated by a special needs student.  She and the student both left at the same time and I've never heard peep about it from any other students.  I was shocked it stayed on the down low. |-| 
|-| co9fsuo || 4 || When  I was a sophomore in high school in '86, the head guidance counselor (married male) would visit my second period literature teacher (unmarried female) like clockwork. He would always visit about 10 minutes into the class and tell our teacher that he needed to talk to her about something. It was like clockwork. Then the two of them would go into the teachers' suite next door. They would be about 3 to 5 minutes in there and she would come back to class straightening her clothes. He never had to worry about having any makeup on him because she didn't wear any, but she sure needed to. I think they later got caught after he would take his dog for a walk late at night and her house was along his route. 
He had the worst ear and nose hair of anyone I've ever seen.  And once this affair started he got that stuff clipped and it was nothing but love sweet love. |-| 
|-| co9fsy6 || 4 || A few years ago in my middle school, one very, VERY beloved teacher (huge personality, fun class, let students stay in her room before 1st period and during their lunch for those who weren't widely accepted and hard a harder time around other kids. I was one such kid.) was super close with another girl my age that was in a rough family situation, mom had died, I think. The girl spent a lot of time with her, went to her house, etc, all in a very mother-daughter way (teacher couldn't have kids of her own) and the two really cared about each other. 

School district caught wind that the girl had spent the night at the teacher's house, even after we were in high school and no foul play was suspected. 

School district suspended the teacher for the rest of the year and said the two were not to speak until the student graduated out of the district. Teacher wrote the girl a tear-jerking farewell letter, telling her that she'd still be there to watch her grow up. 

A year and a half later, before this year when we're juniors, the teacher went in for a relatively minor surgery for a back problem. Adverse reaction of some kind... and she died after a few weeks of being unresponsive. 

No one knew how bad the district fucked up, most people never actually heard how fucking heartbreaking that whole situation was.  |-| 
|-| co9gu4z || 4 || Simply the teachers who the kids think are assholes, we think are assholes too, but we have to defend their asshole behaviour in front of the kids... |-| 
|-| co9hdfb || 3 || It was close to the end of the school year in 1994, and I was in a special ed class. It was second grade. My teacher was this nicest and most kindest personal I'd ever had for a teacher. Since it being the end of the school year, we weren't doing any school work but just watching movies and what not. Someone brought that movie Cool Runnings on vhs. When it got to the end of the movie, I noticed the teacher was getting real emotional and started crying because the cool running guys crashed their toboggan but still managed to cross the finish line. Next thing you know, half the class is crying because the teacher was crying. It was one of the most surrealist moments I'd ever experienced in a classroom, very emotional for everyone. One of my favorite teachers, and I'll never forget her. |-| 
|-| co9hgnu || 4 || Teacher's assistant here - still a student in HS, but I get some behind the scene access gossip between the teachers. I help with a class for students who have recently come to the country/don't speak English. There's been so much crap due to teachers feeling the need to make comments about "Dirty immigrants" or treating them like they're special ed even though most are picking up a foreign language at a great speed. That teachers can be awful to 14 yearolds like that astonishes me, but the adminstration doesn't listen to anything I or sane teachers say. |-| 
|-| co9hjuj || 4 || There was a girl in one of my classes who hat often problems with her parents. They didn't care about her and only came to PTA meetings if the principal invited them personally. She also was terrified of her parents.

One day she didn't come to class which was pretty usual for her but later the police called, stating she jumped of of the window where she lived with her parents and died.

The teachers agreed to tell the class that she transferred to another school but a day later it was in all the newspapers

[edit] the newspapers stated that she was locked in her room and was so terrified of her parents that she jumped |-| 
|-| co9hqds || 3 || Well I taught preschool so naturally I wouldn't share this with the kids, but I had to keep secret from the other staff that our administrator's boyfriend was accused by his daughter of repeatedly raping and molesting her. |-| 
|-| co9hs0v || 3 || When I was in middle school my science teacher's pregnant wife was killed by an English teacher at the same school. Come to find out he was cheating on his wife with the teacher and she decided that she would kill his wife so that she could be with him. The day after it happened I had him as my first class. We sat in his room for around 30 mins until someone came and told us he wouldn't be coming in today.  |-| 
|-| co9hy9h || 3 || Not a teacher, but in my high school we were pretty nosy students, and we tended to find out rather easily some of the behind the scenes drama (also in part because the director's daughter was in some of my classes, and she was always aware of the gossip). Most of it was usually related to teachers having health problems, but there was a particular crisis that was caused by students and kept somewhat hush-hush until we eventually dug up the dirt on our own.

There was an incident two months before we graduated, and since we were a private high school a lot of the kids there were the children of doctors, businessmen, and you tended to get the wrong end of the stick if they found out you were or mere lower middle class (which kinda was my case). And some of them had access to their parents' credit cards, were sheltered as hell, and they felt they were very 'swag' (as one of the nerdy rejects I didn't understand what was the appeal of swag but hey I don't judge). 
So what happened was that three guys got approached by a street gang near the local bus terminal (which was a problem in my town back in the late 2000's; there were cases of drug-trafficking, juvenile prostitution, fights that left bloodstains seeped into the cement behind the station, so for the shelthered suburban life it was pretty hardcore), and the kids were told that if they got access to credit card numbers they'd have a free pass to be part of their gang. 
So, you see, those guys never really thought about street gangs as more dangerous than 'oh so it's like in the rap videos where they talk about the gangsta life' because we're talking about rich white kids from the bottom of suburbia, who don't even know how to take public transit properly because they're usually driven where they want to go, and they were the brand of particularly naive kids so they decide that they want to get in and make a gang with their friends, so they convince friends, and friends of friends, to gather their parents credit cards, and if my memory's right they caused at least a dozen cases of credit card fraud.

In the end, the posh high school was very embarrassed to notice that they expelled six students in three days, and save for a vague notice to the students to be "particularly careful with strangers" we were kept in the dark for a while.

 [English is not my native language, so sorry if some of the wording feels awkward] |-| 
|-| co9i24z || 3 || A lot of times when you have disturbed students you have to keep it kind of hidden.  I have a 6th grader who is only allowed to write with colored pencils and can only use the teacher's sharpener due to stabbing himself and cutting himself. He also has to have a male adult aide go to the bathroom with him. He has 2 minutes to pee and if he isn't done, he has to come out and show the aide his arms then go back for 2 more minutes. Very difficult to keep those things from other kids.  |-| 
|-| co9i2gm || 3 || My math teacher in 9th grade had a sex change over the summer and transfered schools, rumors had been going around, but no one really took them seriously. That was until my 10th grade english teacher, who was very close with him, confirmed it. Apparently he had been going through therapy for years before he could have the operation done. |-| 
|-| co9i2kv || 3 || The middle school principal and vice principal had an affair so the vice principal was moved up to the high school to avoid conflict. Fast forward 3 years and I saw the middle school principal and high school vice principal on a double date with the high school principal and his boyfriend.  |-| 
|-| co9i2xv || 3 || I was an IA in a kindergarten for several years. About twice a year, we would have non-custodial parents try to pick up their child from school illegally and we'd have to call the police. One father pushed past the teachers and was kicking and banging on a locked classroom door like a maniac because he thought his daughter was there. Police had to drag him out, it was scary.  |-| 
|-| co9i310 || 3 || Not a teacher, but here's a story about a teacher I had for the first 3 years of high school (music classes).

This teacher understood that kids in high school are under a lot of pressure to do a lot of things, including sports in addition to all the homework. He took his job seriously but also made sure we enjoyed class. He also believed that concert band classes weren't just a class that a student should be able to take to get their fine arts credits out of the way, and he let students know if he felt it wasn't the best class for them. His analogy was "If a coach for sports at this school would yell at you to make you do better, you would listen and even enjoy it because you know the coach wants you to do good. A teacher points out that you aren't putting in the effort/just don't have the skills for the class, you should feel the same way". (I should clarify that he never yelled in these cases). Apparently, some parents took this as "I don't like your child and he shouldn't be in my class" rather than "I don't know if it is in your best interest to continue in this class next year". That basically put him on the list, or whatever they do when considering if they should fire a teacher. 

Fast forward to my Junior year of High School, and the final year I had him as a teacher. Rather than taking a concert band class, I took a smaller music class that this same teacher taught. This meant being more serious about the material, but also having more time to talk/do random stuff. We would buy pizzas and do homework for other classes on occasion. What I didn't realize is that my teacher was under a lot of stress at the time, and was dealing with a lot of stuff in his personal life, and literally had to take care of some of his personal things during this class. That year, there was a flood in the area where his Mother and Sister lived, and both of them ended up homeless. He took a full 2 months off to help them in their time of need. By the end of the year, it was pretty clear that the Parents and Administration just didn't want him anymore, despite being possibly the best director they had had for the concert band.

I can't remember the details exactly, but I do know that he did not return to the school the next year.



EDIT: Added details. |-| 
|-| co9i3b8 || 3 || The pressure for raising test scores is insane.  We're expected to make huge gains with kids whose parents are not present or supportive.  Our kids are tested with rigorous assessments but we don't have a curriculum that matches up with what they are being tested on.  It's extremely stressful at times and there are days I could just break down and cry, but then the kids are back in from recess and you have to fake a smile. |-| 
|-| co9i5l3 || 3 || My high school liaison officer - a former arson investigator - was charged and convicted of setting his estranged wife on fire and killing her. He's still serving time for it. It made the national news and 20/20 (or some show like that). He was cool as shit though, and there's a lot of doubt about whether he actually did it. That was some real drama that couldn't be hidden from anyone... |-| 
|-| co9i7v7 || 3 || Not a teacher but, all major crime events are kept hidden/not talked about in my school. Some fucking idiot smoked weed in the school bathroom, anyone who talked about it were suspended. Last year, a teacher I had was arrested for heroine possession after a cop pulled her over for a broken headlight. I mean c'mon, you can't just go about not talking about these fucktards. |-| 
|-| co9ib33 || 3 || That my coworker and I absolutely hate each other.  
They sort of kind of get it now, I think because we don't acknowledge each other in front of the classroom (team teaching) anymore since we had our blowup, but yeah.  
She's one of those old ladies that looks sweet as pie, is very "understanding" and gives off this dear-old-granny vibe.  
She speaks in a soft voice, she giggles a lot... can't weigh more than 90lbs and is probably 4'5.  
In reality she's a scum-sucking-road-whore who was out to ruin my life. She used to ask me questions she knew I didn't know the answer to in front of students for the express purpose of making me look like an ass, she would tell me to prepare lessons and then, at the last minute say they weren't sufficient - while she hasn't planned a lesson herself in 2 years, she would come and complain about my performance, but only if it was *in front of my supervisor*, and she knew that I've been leaving work 2 hours early for the past year, so she pretends like she's leaving for the day (she's a part time teacher, so she peaces out when her classes are done) but then she hangs around, waiting for me to leave and then she'll walk around the school asking my coworkers if they've seen me - so *she* doesn't have to report me, hoping that either my coworkers will or that administration will catch wind.  
What she doesn't realize is that I've been here a long time and everyone knows I leave early but nobody cares because - nobody. As a matter of fact, some of my coworkers and even my own supervisor ask me some days why I even bother coming in at all since I don't teach half the time and I just sit around. I work at a very relaxed school with a really empty schedule, so I come in for the afternoons in case I'm needed and leave around dinner time. It's been that way long before since she showed up, and I've never been spoken to about it by anyone.  
I finally blew up at her one day when I caught her complaining about me to my supervisor, called her on it and she denied having done anything. I called a meeting with my supervisor and voiced my concerns. He assured me everyone hates her, and when he talks to her he's just humoring the beast.  
I confronted her - not a good idea, in retrospect.  
She may seem like a sweet old lady, but that bitch is Umbridge. I was completely caught off-guard when I went to confront her by all the horrific things she had to say to/about me.  
Since then we haven't spoken to each other, but continue to teach/work together.

|-| co9idwl || 3 || My gym detach was once high on crack and tried to walk out of a bed bath and beyond with a comforter stuffed under her shirt. She went through rehab and is still teaching at my school.
 |-| 
|-| co9itsi || 3 || I am not a teacher, but a student.

In third grade, I had a teacher who was nice, but some days would get super angry for no real reason. We were well behaved students, so it was odd that she would be upset. She always drank yellow liquid out of a air tight bottle, but no one questioned it, because we thought it was apple juice.

Towards the end of the school year, she left abruptly and was replaced by a student teacher. We were all very confused.
I later found out from someone at the head of the PTA that she was drinking in class.

Looking back, it made sense now why she would chew so much mint gum. |-| 
|-| co9ixqh || 4 || This will probably get buried, but I'll throw it out anyway.

My dad is an oncologist. When I first started high school, some teachers had already heard about me, which I thought was funny since I never knew anyone that had been there before. When I told my parents about this, my dad shrugged it off and said he knew a guy. 

Fast forward to my sophomore year. One of the English teachers died after a long bout with cancer that none of the students were aware of. He was a well-loved teacher, and it shook the student body up quite a bit. When I told my dad this, he said "I know. I was with him last night when he died." Turns out my dad was his oncologist for years. I had never really put it together in my head, but now it made sense. That's how my teachers all knew me when I first started. 

I can only imagine what it was like for the staff who knew to keep that from the students, especially near the end. |-|

|-| co9jal2 || 3 || Over winter break, some 7th graders in my school district had a "sex party" and recorded it. Someone ratted them out to a teacher. It didn't surface in the news until this past week though. Here's a super short article about it.

|-| co9jbjw || 4 || Late to the party, but here it goes-

I taught at a small episcopal school in Florida. They brought in a new headmaster to raise the quality of teaching. The minister who ran the church associated with the school saw this as a threat. This created massive problems for the school and for the headmaster, especially. The kids knew something was going on, but we could not, of course tell them any of this. 

This minister was batshit insane and 100% evil. Alcoholic, abusive to his kids, compulsive liar... you name every characteristic you would least want to see in a man of God and he embodied it. I taught two of his kids; I'll never forget our first PT meeting. He called teaching his son "a waste of time, since basically he's useless."

Because this was small-town Florida, people tried their best to cover their eyes and ears. Instead, they blamed "the outsider," our headmaster. Since most of the teachers supported the headmaster (he was a damn fine man and an excellent boss), this put the teachers in a very tough position. It was nothing, though compared to the stress it placed on the headmaster. 

The reverend (or as a couple of the board of trustees had taken to calling him, "The Rectum") even managed to get a bogus inquiry going into whether the headmaster had been beating up kids. A panel of inquiry was convened, every teacher was interviewed over the course of a week, and it was all happening during mid-terms... it was a massive, stress-inducing waste of time. This was the second The Rectum had tried this; the first time he forced his son to claim to police that he had been struck by a teacher. On neither occasion was any evidence offered to support this or any actual charges filed. The whole objective was a power play. The Rectum got his wish, too; after three years of this BS, our headmaster quit. In a big FU to the church, The Rectum and the community, about half the teaching staff went with him, including me. 

The wheel of karma may turn slowly, but turn it does. The headmaster found a wonderful position at a school in Tennessee where he remained for many years before succumming to cancer. Although his death was a great loss, he died surrounded by friends, family, parents and students who admired and loved him.  The Rectrum got exactly what he deserved, too. A few years after I had left, his affair with a married parishioner was discovered. His wife divorced him, his kids refused to speak with him and he was finally defrocked. 'Last I heard, he was selling used cars somewhere in Central Florida. 

This was years ago and I have told some of my ex-students bits and pieces of it. A few had some idea of the problems, but all of them were shocked when they heard how bad it actually was behind the scenes.  |-| 
|-| co9jrch || 3 || Not a teacher, but I do remember a very solemn event in a teacher's life becoming public. 

She was an older lady and I recall everybody being sad for her when her son's wife died in some kind of freak accident on their honeymoon. It turned out that she was quite possibly killed by  the teacher's son while they were scuba diving. He was tried for murder in Australia where it happened (and ended up pleading guilty of manslaughter) but the US murder case was dismissed. The whole town has been divided on the matter for years. 

Here's the wikipedia for it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Tina_Watson#Incident

edit: a word |-| 
|-| co9k5cg || 3 || I'm not a teacher but my 3rd grade teacher told us she was pregnant. She didnt show up to school for like a week. We thought it was because she was on maternity leave but then the social workers at the elementary school ended up telling us that she had a miscarriage and that it was the second time it happened. Of course us being in 3rd grade didn't fully understand it but when she came back to school you could see the sadness in her. At one point she broke down during class and started crying. 

Honestly I didn't realize how horrible it must have been for her, and now that I think about it I hope that she was able to finally get the child that she always wanted. |-| 
|-| co9l51q || 3 || Not a teacher but I did witness some unfortunate events befall a student at the incompetence of the upper faculty.

We had a student in my middle school who one day we discovered wore a wig...when it was ripped from her head during lunch period. It turns out she had been pulling out and eating her own hair for the better part of a year , hence the wig. Now what should have happened was the student who pulled off the wig should have been punished while the parents of the girl should have been contacted....neither of which happened. The V.P. of our school instead spent the next 3½ hours parading her from room to room having her speak in front of every class about how she pulls her hair out when she gets stressed. The big thing that the V.P. didn't know as he walked her from class to class was why she was so stressed. She had been raped by a family member... an immediate family member. The worst part of all of this was she ended up having to transfer schools because instead of ending at the knowledge that she wore a wig, the V.P. gave a whole class of 7th graders the knowledge of what happened to her hair. So many of them were merciless and harassed her daily. I couldn't imagine going through what she did. It was just awful. |-| 
|-| co9ltbo || 3 || There was a district wide cheating scandal... by the teachers, to boost grades of students.  |-| 
|-| co9nljt || 3 || **TL; DR: Teacher was dealing with a husband diagnosed with Alzheimer's.**

In high school, we had this awesome substitute teacher. She was in her late seventies and very Italian. Didn't take shit from anyone,  but was just wonderful to be around. We loved her.

A few years later, I started a job caregiving in an "old folks home." I took care of this very sweet old man with Alzheimer's, who happened to have the last name as her. After a few weeks she came in and I found out she was his wife. 

I ended up learning a lot about her and her amazing life for the years I took care of him. They had been married for 60 years and had 5 sons. He had been a high ranking officer in the navy and retired. When he was initially diagnosed with Alzheimer's, she tried to take care of him at home. Until he pushed her down a flight of stairs. So, she had to put him in a home and give his entire 5,000$ monthly pension from the navy to the home. In addition,  She had to come out of retirement and go back to teaching. 

They had 5 sons and none of them helped her. She was the strongest woman I have ever met and one of my dearest friends.

|-| co9ck1j || 10 || Gonna get buried, but this happened in a calendar year in one department in which I worked:

* A professor got caught embellishing his resume, and instead of taking a slap on the wrist for it, he resigned—two weeks into semester

* The head of department had an affair with the Vice Chancellor and both of them coordinated means of purging anyone and everyone they didn't like, for whatever reason

* A newly hired professor was a drunk (hence missed many lectures due to being "sick") and was sleeping with her TA

The students were given really vague, bullshit information on all of this, even though it materially affected courses they could take and the overall quality of their education. |-|

|-| co9aeo5 || 6 || Planning the music department spring trip is by far the most drama that I have to hide from my students.  We started planning this back in AUGUST!  And we STILL have no information to hand out to students.

We have to get 3 bids from companies that approved by the county, then submit them with a 30 page field trip packet since it's for an overnight trip, and then have them reviewed for about 4 weeks.  Each music teacher in the department got a seperate bid back at the beginning of Oct, and one teacher volunteered to turn them in.  This teacher did not turn them in until mid December!!!  This has delayed the entire process.  I can't tell the students that the reason we're delayed is because the other teacher hung onto all the bids, even after I repeatedly asked if I could turn them in.  This has caused tension between all the teachers in the department, our department chair, finance person, and administration.   I am hoping at this point that we are still able to go....  |-| 
|-| co9derw || 5 || A young female teacher previously attended the high school she was working at. She was...promiscuous when she was a student there. She was involved in a gangbang with 5 football players and they recorded it. The tape was still circulating among some of the students at the time, it was not . They couldn't really fire her for it but they also didn't want her teaching there. So they basically pulled out the big book of rules and regulations and rode her ass until she had broken enough rules to be let go. They nicely gave her the option of just leaving though. |-| 
|-| co94rbv || 7 || My school is pretty much a soap opera. We have married staff members sleeping together. Then they get pissed that people are aware of the fact they're sleeping together and threaten to sue anyone who talks about it. At a staff Christmas party, one teacher punched another in the face while two married people were hooking up in a car. No one really goes to these parties anymore. If only they knew how horny and dramatic their teachers are. |-| 
|-| co98tw3 || 4 || Oh man, the stories I can tell. Not a teacher, sadly, but both my parents were (and still are after retirement) heavily involved in my school district. Mom was a principle at the elementary school I attended and is now on the school board. Dad was my 8th grade social studies teacher and coach of track and field, everybody knew both my parents and I was a teacher's pet in school.

From them and teachers I'm still friends with I've discovered:
My high school theater teacher was addicted to prescription drugs, kicked it, and replaced that addiction with one to diet coke (she drinks like four cans a day, seriously)

So many girls get pregnant 

So many teachers love to pull pranks on each other (and the administration)

A former assistant to the super attendant (basically the end-all be-all for school district policies with the board) would hack into the emails of different teachers, principles, and staff members to see what they would say about her and the ones she hated she would use their email accounts to send very hateful stuff to other staff to frame up the person she didn't like (she was found out and fired, but not before she managed to get away with a fair amount of money and expose an affair between a high school office worker and a janitor, both of whom were married)

A LOT of people have had sex in the various theaters in my school district (the high school theater and the middle school theater-protip: do not use a UV light in the backstage of any theater ever unless you want to become a germaphobe)

A lot of teachers have affairs? It is really strange to know how many teachers that I befriended were totally screwing a janitor or another teacher behind the back of their spouse 

The biggest one I found out about my former school was a girl I went to elementary school with had a cancer in her bone marrow and had to basically have a procedure that killed off all her bone marrow and then a transplant to give her new bone marrow. Everyone knew about that. What we didn't know was that the procedure essentially fucked up all her body systems and they had a really hard time adapting to the new bone marrow and she was in and out of the hospital until our high school years when her immune system was so compromised she had to homeschool. She just disappeared and no one, not even her former best friend, knew what happened to her but most of the teacher kept in contact with her family to keep her on track with the school district. It was weird to find this out when, for all we figured, she transferred schools. :/ |-| 
|-| co9etlo || 5 || Waaaayyyy late, and of course, not a teacher, but a student. One of my bestfriends had a teacher that was very monotonous in class. He would talk like he had no emotion. His face would also just be a blank space. No emotion at all. A very spaced out look. He would wear the same clothes for a week or so. Sometimes he wouldn't even talk at all... They just thought he was weird until at the end of the year, other teacher told them that he had lost his wife and kids in a car accident two or 3 years before. Suddenly, everything made sense. He was a very kind person though. Always answered with care and tried to let everyone talk... |-| 
|-| co9fdbi || 4 || The fact that we are so underpaid we don't really care about you learning anything. |-| 
|-| co9gopr || 4 || In the 5th grade my teacher and principal along with others tried to have me removed from my family and say I was unstable, insane and violent, that I wanted to bring a bomb to school and shoot my classmates. They resorted to taking me out of class to see the principle over stuff they planted on my locker and my teacher would tell the class to bully me more while I was gone.
My mom took the whole school board to court over this and won. Teacher and principal were fired. At the beginning of the following year, a couple of my old teachers told my mom the truth about everything, turns out they wanted to get money somehow by ruining my childhood in order to renovate the school.
Every teacher at the school apologized to me and my family for doing nothing about it. |-| 
|-| co97etu || 7 || A few years ago there was a bomb threat on the college campus where I worked  at a children's daycare centre.

It was a false alarm, but we had to evacuate everybody and then wait for parents to pick up their children.

We just sang songs and told stories while we waited---of course we never told the four year olds what was up. |-|

|-| co9e6s0 || 3 || I was teaching Kindergarten when 9/11 happened. I had to act like it was totally normal that lots of kids were frantically being picked up by their parents so that the other kids wouldn't be scared. |-| 
|-| co9e7kf || 3 || A few years back a teacher in our school was found by a custodian after school passed out on her classroom floor with her pants unzipped and open. Of course the worst was assumed and an ambulance was called. The paramedics informed the principal that the teacher was passed out drunk. I was vice principal at the time and found several water bottles in different locations around the room filled with vodka. Her students were primary age so we told them she had to go away for a while and that the class would be getting a new teacher. |-| 
|-| co9f6l6 || 3 || Way back in the when my step dad got a job doing IT and attendance for my high school while I was in my senior year... Needless to say, it was a bitch. However, years later he told me some incredibly creepy stories about the dean that he had been holding onto. 
Basically the guy would often get a little too "hands-on" with some of the female students when he thought no one was looking. Apparently complaints we're made but somehow nothing ever came of it... Keep in mind this is a charter school and he was very tight with the board (frat buddies or some bullshit). 

On top of that, he once followed me into an empty bathroom and then began questioning me in this little soft, shit-sucking voice about who was smoking weed at lunch... While I was peeing, standing at the urinal next to me. This is the guy that is now principal of one of the top schools in the US!

Oh and he had this huge greasy fucking soul patch he'd constantly be stroking as he made weird rapey eye contact with.
Icing on the creep cake.  |-| 
|-| co9fjmm || 3 || Our orchestra director got fired for having a student play his "woodwind."

Now that I've got your attention.  You see, the student had graduated three or four years before.  She was going to a local college and he had recently got divorced so apparently they began dating.  No actual confirmation on any woodwind playing, but the fact they were dating caused the principal to fire him. |-| 
|-| co9fxml || 3 || Late to the party, but my mom taught at my middle school so I got all the dirt. 

Apparently my eighth-grade math teacher had an affair with the Spanish teacher. (IIRC, both were married). They got found out when the math teacher e-mailed some nudes to Señor (...it was the early 2000s) and he accidentally printed them in the staff lounge instead of his own classroom. 

Also, one of the special ed teachers got fired for allegedly fondling girls in his class. Most of the staff thought he was innocent though; it was this small clique of girls who were best friends and they all came forward at the same time. That said, the dude was weird -- he came to work in BDSM gear for Halloween one year. 

Oh, and a history teacher appeared in Playboy when she was in college. It was common knowledge among the staff, but no one outside the school ever found out and to my knowledge she's still happily employed. 

Edit: ALSO, a few years after I graduated, Playboy History Teacher got really drunk at the Christmas party and slapped Slutty Math Teacher. It might have been the other way around, but a slap was definitely exchanged between those two circa 2011. |-| 
|-| co9g8n2 || 3 || I'm a teacher and this happened a few years ago.  

We had a career day and my colleague is sitting in his classroom supervising while this guy talked to the class about whatever his job was. My buddy is bored so he googles the presenters and it turns out the guy we invited to career day is a convicted sex offender. Afterwards, he went to administration and told them, and they told my friend that they knew about it, but the man in question was "reformed". 

We thought that was crazy. You can't protect the kids from everything, but at the very least we can avoid INVITING predators into the school. I looked into it and it turned out there was no law in our state prohibiting sex offenders from being on school campus. I contacted my legislative representative and he drafted a bill to make it illegal. It never made it out of committee. However, a bill that would give all the schools air conditioning did, because it had the backing of the teachers union. The union was more interested in making sure teachers had AC, rather than making sure students were provided pretty basic safety measures.  |-| 
|-| co9gmew || 3 || Not a teacher but on 9/11 I was in 6th grade and our principal made an unexpected announcement that "America has been attacked" and that we would have a prayer service (Catholic school).  The teachers all knew what had happened but were not allowed to tell the students.  They had to keep teaching and pretend it was a normal day but you could tell very easily that something happened.  I've always felt like it could have been handled a little better...
 |-| 
|-| co9gp0m || 3 || There was an admin worker(married)at my school who had an affair with a lunch lady(not married). The admin worker ended up killing himself and trying to burn his house down with his family still in it. The lunch lady keeps a stapler from him that when questioned about it she just says its from someone special. But ya we didn't find out for like 2 months. |-| 
|-| co9gxpv || 3 || Wow. I actually have a LONG list of in school drama. Enough that we should really have a documentary crew at our school reporting on everything.  

I'll try to summarize everything that's gone on.  1. We're a charter school so we have our own peronsal school board. They are shady, underhanded and have been destroying an amazing school like a cancer.  What have they done? Fired the principal who MADE the school and gave no reason. The reason they did it?  He backed the teachers and didn't take crap from them.
2. The board has been firing teachers who complain about them. I've lost 20 coworkers since December.
3.  The board claims to be doing this for the students. Students have been crying about losing teachers so they obviously don't care.
4. They are making teachers work more periods in a day and have not compensated them in any way, nor have they offered. I am one of them.  I'm afraid I will lose my job if I say anything.
5.  They have turned us from a college prep school into a test prep school. I do not teach to the test, but they are forcing me to teach from a test prep booklet. I have to document how much time I spend on it, too.
6.  The refuse to suspend or expel to make the school appear to not have discipline issues. I've been told not to send kids to the office (basically no matter what.)
7.  Teachers are afraid for their jobs.

There is so much more, but I'm typing on my phone and I'm tired... I keep a lot to myself, but I tell my students as much as I can... Without getting myself in trouble. |-| 
|-| co9kcd5 || 3 || I know on my end of teaching (private sector) everyone is terrified of the rich and powerful parents. One timed complaint could end the career of some of the best teachers. You want to see a teacher scared? Give his adolescent students power over him.  |-| 
|-| co98zji || 7 || We had a long term substitute teacher that we were horrendous too. Made fun of him, sassed him. Verbally abused him every day for about four months, but he continued to try to teach us. About the fourth or fifth month of our verbal abuse, he informed us he had a late progression of cancer and would not be able to teach us anymore, but we had made his last days more enjoyable and tolerable as the cancer ate him alive. We all knew that statement wasn't true, we were all ass holes. So as he stood at the front of the classroom, telling us he was going to die, we all burst out crying. Because we felt guilty? Probably. But he'd been taking a beating from us everyday while his own body beat him up too. To this day, we all still feel guilty about this, and it eats us up knowing he died shortly after.  |-|

I never knew if this was true or not, I found this out much later once the math teacher got pregnant and it was his. That's when I found out it was true - the guidance counselor told me. By then, it was my second to last year teaching there.

|-| co9a0cr || 3 || Had a Chemistry teacher for the first few years of secondary school. He was passionate about his job and everything about chemistry, he loved teaching and joking with us every lesson we had with him. He was in his late 40s/early 50s. 

One day, he got a phone call whilst teaching a class (one of my friend's was there), his wife was divorcing him because of an apparent personal matter. Obviously he was devastated, but I believe he carried on with the lesson nonetheless.

Past forward a few years later, I've finished secondary school, as all of my friends have as well. I hear that my chemistry teacher was on holiday with his ex wife and their kids as a family holiday... During the holiday they discovered the ex wife had a late stage of cancer without knowing, she dies in almost no time after discovering this. This kind of event must have destroyed Mr. ____. One of my friends saw him apparently walking down a street one day and described him as being "a shell" of a person...  he had a really fucked up few years. Felt so bad for him. |-| 
|-| co9bi81 || 3 || Throwaway. My high school is sort of a private school. It's big and the entire state assumes we're a great school because of our size. Thousands of students come here from several towns and we have an operating budget in the tens of millions. 

The big secret is that our administration gets to decide how our money gets spent with no oversight. The result is that some teachers are making thousands more than others. Most teachers are completely underpaid. Funding for academics is gutted, and we have pet projects that are flashy and good PR that are funded through the roof. (in a school that spends less than $4 per student for science we have spent over $100,000 in equipment and facilities for a film class). That and rampant nepotism and corruption. For example entire families get hired and promoted, friends of administration get no-bid contracts. Fun stuff!

We're really a public school but our state government is financially vested in keeping us private to prevent us from getting state pensions.  |-|

I could have stayed on but how could I work in such an environment when I know these two lazy, creepy fucks are lying behind my back? How can I reward the agency who listens to such tripe? Passive aggressive creepy homosexual boss as well.

I was a great teacher, well liked and worked hard. They ruined the gig for me. Could say nothing to students about any of it.

- It's actually more important to avoid giving them reasons to pass on you than to give them reason to hire. Or, that is, it's harder to do the first than the second. Be open to anything unless it's a deal breaker for you.
- Voice everything in the positive. Instead of "I'd rather not do X," say "I'd rather do Y."
- Know something about the company before you go (Google it, look at news stories, etc.) and ask questions about it.
- Ask questions in general. Be curious. It sets a good tone, plus it gives the interviewer an excuse to talk.
- Have a good time. If you start with the attitude of interviews being fun, you'll be more relaxed and make a better impression. |-|

Essentially, you want to be concise and thoughtful in the conversation. Don't take 5 minutes to answer a question, take 45 seconds. When you don't know something well enough (like your daily duties, company's value prop, or personal successes) you tend to drag on and over embellish. Be short but informed. 

Next, think about WHY you're leaving. Then try to put a positive spin on it. Create ACTIONS from it. Example: under-qualified idiot get the promotion you wanted? "I've really enjoyed my time here at ___, and I've learned a lot. But I'm ready to build something. I want to work somewhere where they believe in investing greater responsibility in their employees. I want to earn autonomy and then mentor others so that we can bring this company into the future." 

Lastly, don't just "explore" the opportunity. Do a little research. Ask informed questions. "Where do you see this company in 5 years? How does this position help us get there?" At the end, you MUST CLOSE THEM. Express further interest, ask what the next step is, and follow the fuck up. Send them a short email thanking them for their time and ask them again what is next. This is how they'll know you're serious and driven.

Good luck! |-|

I went to an interview for a job running a children's playgroup. They asked, "What would you do if a child had an accident?" and I thought, hmm that's an odd question but I guess they want to know that I know how to handle stuff like that... 

So I answered, "Well, I would just calmly get the parent and..." and proceeded to humiliate myself by talking about *pee* when they were asking about how I would handle a medical emergency. I am still mortified. That feeling you get when you're not done with the interview yet but you know you're not getting the job... eugh. |-|

NEVER blame someone else for mistakes you made. That covers a lot of ground but it's true 100% of the time. 

Never pronounce someone's name wrong. If you don't know for sure before you go ASK. There's nothing wrong with while shaking hands saying, "Forgive me, but I'm not positive how to pronounce your name." Ideally, you'll find this out before you get there, but that's perfectly acceptable. 

Do NOT ask about raises and promotions too soon. I've had plenty of hiring mangers say "he seemed more interested in moving on to the next job than doing the one I was interviewing him for."

|-| co9oamx || 30 || I posted this a while back in /r/jobs...hopefully it will be of some help:

This post was inspired by /u/One_time_use12's post ["How I Picked Who to Hire"](http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1f15cf/how_i_picked_who_to_hire/)...I thought I would try to encapsulate any general rules in terms of my own hiring decisions in the past, in the hopes of informing current job seekers about how hiring *really* happens and to dispel some of the notions perpetuated by people outside the process who make claims about "how hiring happens" based on their perception or based on individual anecdotes.  Naturally other hiring managers may have different priorities, just as mine differ slightly from One_time_use_12's, but the vast majority of a few dozen hiring managers I have personally known (and more certainly those I have trained) operate on similar principles.

To give this some context I work in game development, and I am not hiring at the moment (sorry!) but I have been a part of the hiring process for programmers, artists, game designers, producers, audio engineers, testers, administrative assistants, IT personnel, and managers for more than a decade and I was also a manager who hired a couple of people where I worked during my undergraduate degree.  I have never counted up how many people I have hired (or provided key feedback recommending to hire them or not), but it's somewhere between "many dozens" and the low hundreds and I do know that I have interviewed hundreds of candidates and looked at a multiple of that number of resumes so quite possibly in the low four digits.

As a very general rule, when I hire someone I am looking for the best person (that I can afford with my hiring budget allowance) to do the work on the team for which I am hiring them.

**Things that I care about:**

* Have they done similar work in the past at (or close to) the level I need them to?
* Can they actually show me relevant work that they have done, whether it was for another company or for school or on their own?
* Do they give the impression during the interview process that they will work well with the people who are already on the team or who I might hire to be on the team, regardless of their job category?
* Do they communicate clearly and effectively?
* Do they seem to have confidence?
* Do they seem like they have any passion for the work (or do they just want a job)?
* Along similar lines, what kind of job do they want/are they expecting?  Are those expectations realistic?
* How likely are they to just keep looking for another/better job once they're hired?
* Do they have any salary requirements, and if so are they realistic with respect to the local market for their skillset?
* What has been the likely quality of the part of their education that is relevant for the job?
* What is their general approach to problem solving?
* What is their general mindset around asking for help when they need it?
* Can we afford them?
* If it's not an entry level position...
  * Has the work they've done before been successful?
  * Do they seem to understand why or why not?
  * Does the work that they got done in previous jobs seem to indicate they have a solid work ethic?
  * How much does it seem like they learned on the job, and how quickly?
  * What has historically been their demonstrated ability to estimate how long it will take them to do something?
* If it is an entry level position...
  * Can they describe a situation where they have worked cooperatively with other people?
  * How was their school experience?  I'm not super hung up on GPA, but if it was less than stellar they should have an explanation why.
* Do they know the business and the company well enough to ask relevant questions?
* Do they have basically good hygiene?
* Do they have references who speak well about them?

**Things I care a lot less about:**

* How they are dressed (to a point...they have to at least dress like they give a shit)
* What their unrelated hobbies are
* Who they know (with the exception that if they have actually worked directly with someone I know and trust who can give them a good, honest recommendation...and even then *they are not a guaranteed hire and still have to be interviewed* to attempt to validate their fit for *this* job on *this* team)

**Things I don't care about at all:**

* Race, religion, sexual orientation (if any of those are even apparent)
* How attractive they are
* Where they're from
* Whether or not they have ever been in any fraternity or sorority
* Who they are related to
* Whether they send a thank you card or other follow up

**Some resume red flags:**

* Resume is unreadable
* Resume contains false information (admittedly this can be difficult to detect, but we had one guy apply for a job claiming to have worked on well over 100 games, some of which members of our team had worked on who had never even heard of him)
* Resume contains mistakes (part of being able to communicate effectively...if you can't create this very important document with no mistakes or find someone else to check it for mistakes, you're either showing poor communication skills or a distinct lack of giving a shit)
* Utter lack of references
* Lots of very short jobs (this can sometimes be explained, but in my experience tends to indicate serial dissatisfaction either from their perspective or from their employer's perspective and typically neither of those have promising reasons behind them...or if it's repeated layoffs or companies being shut down it indicates potentially a lack of ability to judge the stability of an offering)

**Interview red flags:**

* Interrupting
* Not paying attention
* Excessive/unrelated rambling
* Unexcused lateness (I do recognize that sometimes shit happens)
* Too much badmouthing previous employers
* Giving bad answers to questions
* Coming across as a know-it-all
* Other behavior inappropriate for a diverse office environment including off-color humor, disrespect, sexual innuendo (or overt advances), sexism, agism, racism, or interpersonal overfamiliarity.

Hopefully this clears up some mystery and helps some of you in your job seeking. |-| 
|-| co9czgt || 114 || In contrast to the question:  ALWAYS have a question prepared for if/when your potential employer asks "Do you have any questions" or any permutation of that question.  If anything, at least respond with "No, you have made everything perfectly clear sir/ma'am." |-|

|-| co9cd05 || 342 || This does not quite answer the question as asked, but it is the single best piece of interview advice I have ever heard, so I will post it.

The interviewer is probably just as nervous as you are.  As humans, we want others to like us, and they want to make a good impression on you.  So, as you come in try to make them feel at ease.  Smile, a bit of small talk, it doesn't really matter what you do.  If you set them at ease they will like you, and you will have gained the initiative in the interview.  Do this, and it becomes much harder to fuck up the rest of the experience.

As for things to avoid doing- try to get their gender pronouns right.

Edit: Something a commenter reminded me of- people are (generally) more interested in themselves than others.  If you can (without sounding insincere) get them to talk about themselves.  Ask questions about their experience in the company, ways in which they are socially involved with coworkers, how they came to the company.  These types of questions make your life much easier. |-| 
|-| co9j5sc || 20 || I personally believe the best thing you can do for an interview is to really know how to answer 'so tell us about yourself.'  I frame it like this

a short summary of your career, a short summary of your previous work experience, a short summary of your strengths and accomplishments, and then why you want to work for that specific company

I'm a music teacher.

I said

I've been an educator for three years, two were at segunda school of finance.  while there I 'two short accomplishments'.  I developed strong skills in 'two buzz word skills'  I am looking for the opportunIty to 'add my skills and talents to your group and stuff.'

|-| co9lvyg || 17 || Chances are this is buried and you won't see it until after, so here's hoping it went well. Trying to add without repeating...

Timing: early, but not too early. Used to get on my last nerve when someone would show up 20-30-40 min early. Interviews happen at the appointed time unless a crisis happens   

Prepare: having been on both sides it can be difficult to find quality info to latch on to.  Do your homework about the company and know the info available to the public. One guy came to interview on time, dressed well, had copies of resume, all that.  Lost job in first 30 seconds when he couldn't answer "what is our mission statement?" It was a non-profit company; the mission statement is 75% of the job.  

Relax: if it's a structured interview chances are some parts are designed to test your 'reflexes', how well you think on your feet, and etc.  Can only nail those by being yourself.  

Courtesies: know them, use them. With all the 'interview tips' easily available, still surprises me how few people use the standard courtesies.  If it's a competitive interview, take every edge you can.

Interview back: I always like to ask "what does success look like for this position?"  Unless it's something with an obvious goal (sales = make money) their answer will tell you a lot about what kind of employer/boss they will be.  In kind, know what the big goals of the job are, and if you don't, ask. 

Proactive: take the lead in asking about the interview process and structure. If they say "we will be finishing first rounds of interviews this week" you say "great!  I will call you on Monday to check on my application".  Or, if the timing is right, literally ask if you can have the job. That's why you're there, right? |-| 
|-| co9btbi || 178 || Punning.

I actually did this in my recent business school interview. I was so damn nervous since it's extremely rare to get an interview with this school and then my internet (based in Asia, had to do a Skype interview) started acting up so I couldn't do the call properly. When I'm nervous, I crack awkward, painful dad jokes.

At one point, they asked me, "What would you do in the event of a terrorist attack?"

I replied with, "Well, the event's going to be a *bomb*."

Yup. I cringed as soon as I heard what I was saying. |-| 
|-| co9kwyc || 13 || If I interview you for your technical skills, please, PLEASE *have* some technical skills.

If I ask you about MS-DOS (hehe), please don't answer with "I love DOS, but it's 30-40 years old and nobody uses it" when I even handed you the "using DOS, how would you..." question!

ALso, answer the damn question.

If I ask "how familiar are you with DOS?", please don't answer with a bunch of nonsensical bullshit. I'd take a "I'm not familiar with it" over today's winner who said "DOS is the basis for all operating systems and is what Windows runs on, but no one uses it anymore".

*sigh*


Oh, and when I ask "why do you think you'd be a good fit for our company?", please give examples of what you can do for us instead of "I have a kid and want something stable to be able to keep him fed". 
I want to hear how I/the company will benefit from hiring you. 

Say "I come from a very similar culture in my current position and I am also intimately familiar with Zebra label printers, so I should be able to fit in and be great support from week 1".

Or something like that. |-| 
|-| co9hjbo || 75 || You posted this around the time I was being interviewed by wendy's. I got the job. |-| 
|-| co9bv3o || 175 || Telling the interviewer that you met a giant fish and fucked it's brains out.  |-| 
|-| co9ksn5 || 32 || 1.Don't walk out of there without telling them,  verbally,  that you want that job and why.  And when you do this,  mean it.  If you can't do it and mean it,  look for a different job because you won't want to stay there long.  


I'm a contract worker,  so I interview and take on new positions 2 to 3 times a year.  This one thing,  if it was the case that I wanted the job,  has gotten me every position I've wanted.  It's not the only thing,  of course,  but the prospective employer wants someone that wants to be there,  and going to the interview is not a guarantee that you want the job.  You have to tell them.  


2.Interview them while they interview you.  This is especially true if you have more than one iron in the fire,  but even if it's your only opportunity,  make sure you like them and their company as well.  Ask the hard questions,  get the answers to the things you want to know.  


This not only helps you gauge if you want to be there,  it also makes you look engaged and responsive.  Most companies don't want a mindless robot,  they want someone that is thinking things through.  Asking good questions proves that you have a good head on your shoulders.  In interviews,  I ask almost as many questions as I answer. |-|

"How will my success be measured?"  Shows that not only do you want to do well, you want to understand what "do well" actually means to your would-be employer. And if they can't answer it, you get a nice warning that they don't know what the fuck they're doing.

|-| co9kk8i || 10 || There was a post on TIFU about a guy that offered his interviewer a joint...

Yeah don't do that.  |-| 
|-| co9jda1 || 23 || 1.) Don't throw out the first salary. Make them make the first offer. This will require some silliness. When they ask, "What were you expecting to earn here," respond with, "I was hoping for a competitive offer that would end my job search. "What would you consider a competitive offer?" "A fair rate for someone of my experience, similar to what I've seen on salary websites." "Could you provide a dollar estimate?" "I could, but during preparation for this interview, I was advised not to."


2.) Negotiate the offer. ALWAYS negotiate the offer. Your first "offer" will be a letter of offer they will present as though it is a final document. It is not. Typically, you can negotiate salary and vacation days. Other negotiable items may include health care benefits, 401k matching, and use of company assets like a company car. You can always use a line like this one:

"You have made an enticing offer. If you were willing to increase the salary to $X I would be happy to sign a contract right away." 

If they decline an increase in pay, or they only meet you part way, you can use a line like this one:

"I appreciate that you are working with me towards this. Why don't we split the difference and add 5 vacation days?"

3.) NEVER talk about your personal needs, unless they are a negotiating point for the position. The hiring agent doesn't care what your mortgage is or how sick your daughter is. Everything you bring to the negotiation should be what your qualifications are and what you want in exchange for your labor.

4.) Relax. Talk to the hiring agent like they are a person. Inquire about their life at the company and if they enjoy it. Ask them about sports, local life in the area, whatever.

5.) Always come in with a few questions about the company. This is pretty dumb, you can find out everything you need to know on the company website and by reading their prospectus, but ask a few questions anyway. Its a checkbox on the interviewers mental sheet.

6.) Beware non-compete clauses. The rules depend on your field, but really ask yourself if you are willing to abide by it. |-|

Well I waited in my car for about ten minutes but it was really hot and my AC wasn't working too well.  I then had the brilliant idea to go sit in, what I assumed would be a waiting/seating area.  It turned out that the building that they were holding the interviews in was just one big conference room.  I opened the door and saw them in the process of an interview, everyone just shut up and stared at me.  I apologized and backed out of the door.  

My turn comes up and eventually the classic question about my biggest weakness/flaw comes up.  I told them my biggest flaw was that I was always really early, and then they laughed. |-|

|-| co9nc5u || 3 || If you have to take any kind of test and you don't know the answer don't rage quit, be courteous and just say you don't know the answer.

My husband is a software developer and the other day he was interviewing a guy for a position on his team, it was the guy's second interview and it was a group interview over Skype with the team the final part of which was to take a C# test they designed for him. During the test the guy was getting increasingly agitated and finally just blurted out "I'm the wrong guy for you" and hung up on them. Everyone was shocked... now they have to write feedback to the recruiter who sent this guy to them. 

So yeah, don't freak out if you don't know something, just be calm, friendly and upfront.  |-| 
|-| co9nq56 || 4 || My sister was in an interview when the guy that was interviewing her asked if she had a job application. She said no, and asks if he could get her a copy. The guy looked at her funny and left the room. He came back a minute later with a cup of coffee. She was confused but accepted it and said thanks. She left and never got a call back. Afterwards, she realized that when she asked for a "copy" of the application, he thought she was asking him to get her a coffee, in the middle of an interview. Explains why she didn't get a call back for the job.

So ya probably don't do that |-| 
|-| co9nvxn || 4 || Okay this is not something to avoid, but it's some advice that helped my girlfriend a lot during interviews. She was allways very nervous, but when I told her that the companies made a choise out of lets say 50 applications and they chose you for an interview! You applied yourself the best way you could, and they are interested in hearing your ideas and vision! You totally rock! |-| 
|-| co9o1sg || 3 || Okay, on a serious note, this is the best way I have found to close and end an interview. Say this when they ask you if you have any further questions,"I do, but it's a simply one. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being 'Where did we get this guy? He should be a greeter at WalMart. YECK!' and 10 being 'HOLY COW! We have to hire this guy right now!', how would you say I did with this interview?" You could also say "...would you feel comfortable saying how I did on this interview?"
Their answer can teach you a lot. Either the liked you or they didn't. If their answer is toward the negative, I have always followed up with this,"Thank you for your honesty. Is there anything I could have done differently or better in the interview?" Their answer here can be extremely useful in future interviews. (There are techniques you can use to turn those 'we'd never hire you' answers into 'when can you start', but I've never wanted to work for someone who didn't want me first, so I don't use those. |-|

"How well is the coffee in the company pot liked?"

|-| co9psew || 3 || http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3454 |-| 
|-| co9qd2t || 3 || I'm a career coach and used to conduct interviews for my previous IT company. This is one key thing I work on with clients when prepping for interviews:

* Don't focus on why you want the job, focus on why *they* should want *you* in the job. Even when they ask why you want it, remember they aren't fairy godmothers there to grant your wishes, they're considering you and all candidates from the point of view of their needs and what you will bring to the role. Good salespeople focus not on the features of a product or service, but the benefits those bring to a potential buyer. Your skills and achievements are features of your career; what are the benefits to the employer? Don't leave them to make the leap of logic themselves. E.g.

"I'm an independent learner. You won't need to hold my hand or keep showing me how to do something. I'll build on the training to get up to speed as quickly as possible to become a productive member of your team."

Putting yourself in their shoes should make you not do these other things, but I'll list them anyway:

* Do not hint at any drama! Unless you're going for a job where it's expected that geniuses will be over-dramatic, or are so in-demand people will hire you despite your drama, in which case you're not likely to be reading this. People say "don't be negative about your previous employer", which is true but just a smaller part of this bigger rule. Even if you feel you were wronged in some way, bitching about it in an interview automatically sets off warning bells in an interviewer's mind that you may cause or attract drama, hurting team relations and productivity and potentially causing HR or legal issues. Airing your wounds in an interview also shows you're not thinking about their needs but yours (as per my first paragraph).

* Don't just read their website/job documentation for factual info. Read the language they use and what values they talk about, and mirror that language back to them (in your targeted CV/covering letter/application form as well as the later interview stage).

* Don't see an interview as a scary test; see it as an opportunity for you to show why you'd be a great asset to the prospective employer. Take it seriously, but enjoy it!

|-| co9r9yo || 4 || My daughter went for an interview at a hospital for a job in the pharmacy, she had no experience at all. She revised different things on drugs (can I say drugs, it sounds aweful, but that's what a pharmacy deals with), she asked about options to further her career, and said that she really was interested in the job and that she wanted the job. But the biggest thing was that she made an appointment to look around the pharmacy before her interview. This may not help you because your interview is within hours of this comment, but it may help others. She got the job. There were 220 applicants, mostly with experience, some actually worked in the department. The person who gave her the job said she was impressed with the fact that she had researched the subject and had taken the time to go and look around. I hope this helps someone! |-| 
|-| co9rb6c || 3 || Ive interviewed quite a bit in the past year (long story short vet who got out and did other things then came back to my original career which is IT.) There was only one time I didn't get a job I interviewed for here are my secrets. 


Go in with confidence. If you don't believe you are the perfect person for the job neither will they. 


Be friendly. If you can go in and pseudo make friends with them ie: make them laugh once or twice, smile, ask thoughtful questions. If you can get them to like you as a person they will want to bring you in more.

For guys suit up. I understand this doesn't apply to every job but suiting up says a lot about you. No matter the job you are working to make the best impression. The suit will also make you more confident. 


Ask hard thoughtful questions. My favorite is "this time next year when I'm employee of the year what will I have done to get there" this forces the employer to tell you exactly what they want in an employee. If you make them think they will remember you when deciding on other candidates. 

Ive used these and done very well in past interviews. |-|

Be nice to the receptionist! She/he probably works directly for the HR department. 

Say hello to anyone that walks in or out of the area you're waiting in. You never know who could be a CEO or your future manager!

When being called to set up your interview, be courteous and let us hear a little excitement, we'll put that in a note. If you're rude and don't really sound interested, that shit gets written down too. 

When coming in and being asked to fill out an application, don't give the receptionist shit about it. It's not their rules that you have to fill one out even if you already applied online. No huffing and puffing when filling it out, that shit gets written down. RUDE. 

Fill out the application completely, none of this "see resume" bull. If you do that, it tells the employer that you are lazy! 

Lastly, if they make you wait, don't get upset or pissy about it. There is s not much the receptionist can do! 

TL:DR : be pleasant to every one at the business you are interviewing at!! And don't give anyone shit!!  |-|

|-| co9nz12 || 3 || Don't be excessively early. I had a candidate turn up 45 minutes early to an interview once. I don't know why he came that early as the office is in central London and there are ~10 coffee shops within a 5 minute stroll from my office.

Don't be late, either.

5-10 minutes early is fine/expected.

It's an interview for a job offer, the interviewer is not your mate down the pub. The interview will start with some easy questions to help relax you. This is not an indication that you can use inappropriate language. I asked one candidate about a game he was developing for a smart phone. He mentioned that it had something to do with b**steality. This was within the first 5 minutes of the interview. I would have ended the interview there and then but I'd wrapped my right leg around my chair leg and given myself a deadleg. I had to endure that interview for another 10 minutes before I had enough circulation in my leg to show him the door.

Gentlemen, if it's an office with a dress code i.e. suit &amp; tie, don't wear white socks.They stand out against a dark suit with black shoes.  This isn't the 1980s. Your appearance matters.

The interviewer will go through your CV at the interview. No typos please. And when you're discussing your previous projects use phrases such as "I did this", "I was responsible for that". If you say, "We did this" or "the team did that" the interviewer won't have a clue as to exactly what you did. He may think that you just beefed up your CV with someone else's accomplishments.

They kept saying "think about your answer" and honestly you just want to answer as quick as you can about the first thing that comes to mind.

If you have to use the restroom in the middle of the interview, the thing to do is wait until a section of questioning is over, ask to excuse yourself to the washroom briefly, and then finish the interview. 

If you try to pee in your water bottle under their desk they will know and they will call security and you will accidentally get a little pee on them, meaning you might not get the job.

So, I get in, enter my name "Viper". So, fucking excited. Then the reigning champion locks on me after I kill him and sits there respawn killing me the entire time. The son of a bitch!!

I flipped out. Smashed the controller repeatedy into our table, cracking the controller open and denting the table. 

Had to buy a new controller. Wife was not impressed. |-|

F1 2010 - a game that is either too hard or too easy. I chose too hard, because too easy was, uh, too easy.

30th/last lap of the Australian GP, and I spin out at the end of the race, final lap, final corner. No flashbacks left, and it's been 30 laps.
I just sat there, without pausing, at the side of the track and cried. I cried for about 20 minutes before my dad came it, asking me what was wrong.

When he knew it was just because I span out, he laughed and told me *his* F1 story.

F1 2003 on the PS2 - A game that is too hard.

He had spent the past 3 hours at Albert Park, Australia. Practicing, qualifying, warming up. 

Only to be smashed off and out of the race at the first corner. |-| 
|-| co9243w || 22 || I had the latest Ace Combat game because I love fighter jet games (until now).  There's this mission that's like 3 long missions put together so if you fuck up, you start from stage one.  I had to chase down these five Russian ace pilots and the game would always take be across the boundary line to kill the last one starting a five second countdown before you failed the mission.

In a mix of pure anger, confusion and grief I couldn't form words. All that could be heard from the basement was the crack of my controller bouncing from the floor and me unplugging the television.

**DC Universe Online.**

I expect some of you may understand what I'm about to talk about. 

I was a Villain because most of my friends were villains and I minded my own business doing missions and everything that I was supposed to do.

For those of you who don't know, one huge gear grinder about DC Universe Online is that anyone who is a Hero can come up to you and attack you out of the blue and kill you. Same thing with Villains attacking Heroes and so on. 

When I was a low level I kept getting attacked for no reason, then this one guy decided to camp around where my mission was designated and he kept attacking me, he was a level 30 and I was a real low level, I had no chance. For those who don't know, this mission took like 5 minutes to get to from the spawn point of the Villain base, so dying and getting there several times was very frustrating and time consuming on my part. But he didn't care, he killed me every time and started teabagging me every time and started sending me messages like: **"LOL U SUCK GURGAHSDGAYYALMAO"**.

I screamed at the TV and started stomping on the ground until I finally said: *I don't know who you are UchihaBillyz, but I will find you, and I will teabag you.*

**Edit:** To the many asking, no. I was not able to find him and teabag his family, but I did stop a lot of these bullies in the future after I leveled up tremendously and I teabagged them, satisfaction indeed. |-|

We lost 16-14. 

That player was kicked from the team after. He was good, but got tunnel vision a lot and it cost us the match a long with prize money, and possible sponsorships if we finished well. I yelled a lot at him when it happened but stopped when i saw how bad he felt.  |-|

There were different spots I got stuck on for a few deaths but eventually would work my way past, really just came down to lots of jabs and rolls. The protect the translator section took me an entire month to beat though. Halfway through the month, I actually got within 1 enemy and maybe one good combo from successfully passing the level, when there was another dog that lunged out from behind the pedestal and KO'd me.... I have never been angrier at a video game than that moment. I was so close and actually felt like this time I was going to get beyond this immensely annoying section. I destroyed the controller in my hand and put the game away for a few days before I could actually play it again.
Eventually got past it and beat the game, and to this day still consider it my single favorite gaming accomplishment. |-|

|-| co9fe5l || 10 || Runescape - Underground Pass (Members Quest)

Involves using your 'Agility' skill to navigate a bunch of obstacles with the RNGods deciding whether you fail or not. Takes like 30 minutes of clicking to get to this one land bridge in a big cavern. 

Turns out there's a big ass crack in the land bridge, so you need to jump over it. RNGods decide that I fall, so I take a bunch of damage...and lo and behold I'm running low on food (which restores health.) So..I talk to one of the dwarf NPC's at the bottom of the cavern and he graciously offers me a beer. Beers restore health while taking away some strength points where I only need agility...so why not? 

I go back up and after five minutes I am at the land bridge once again. RNGods cast me down. I drink more beer. Another 5 minutes, another fall, more beer. 

After nearly 40 more minutes of painstaking clicking and my 12 year old eyeballs bugging out with frustration (I couldn't make any noise since I wasn't supposed to be playing games), my sister creeps behind me and in good humor gives me a scare whispering "...bgaw" in my ear. I flip out. 

"BGAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWW!!!!!" I scream at the top of my lungs in retort. Mom: "WHAT'S GOING ON???" 

About five minutes of chaos later, I resume playing. I check my stats. I have -20 agility, out of +64 originally. O_o. The fuckin beer takes away agility points...fuhhhhhhml. |-|

|-| co93cdl || 29 || Back in the 90s, my younger brother must have been 9 or 10 years old.  We had a game for NES called Jackal.  If you remember this game it was fun as hell, but definitely had some pretty tough parts.  Well, one time it was just TOO MUCH for the poor lil guy, and he got so mad when he died that at one point, he stood up, hocked up an oyster the size of Slimer from Ghostbusters 2 (not the original because obviously Slimer bulked up for the sequel) and SPIT at the television.

Now, our NES was hooked up to a small 12 inch color TV that originally belonged to my stepfather.  Wouldn't you know it, at the exact moment the spittle was forcefully ejected from my brother's lips was the exact moment my stepfather decided to walk into our hallway to adjust the thermostat in the house.  My stepdad bore witness to watching this glob of saliva hurtling towards his beloved old TV.  The thing about my stepfather is, he puts a lot of sentimental value into personal items.  Once I dropped a bowl in the kitchen and it shattered into a million pieces.  This bowl was also my stepfather's, and for days he told me about his fond memories of this bowl, and the shit they've been through together.  You'd have thought this bowl was his buddy from the Vietnam War.  Except he didn't go to Vietnam, because he was a hippy and worked at head shops in his youth.  

But I'm getting ahead of myself, let's go back to the story.  There my stepfather stood, frozen in his tracks, as this steaming, viscous blob of prepubescent loogie flew gracefully through the aroma of dirty socks and Clearasil, and splattered across the iridescent glow of his old friend.  The words GAME OVER blinked condescendingly through the bubbles and snot.  The red, blue, and green "pixels" enlarged to a visible checkerboard of color, magnified by the power of the mouth juices adorning the television screen.  My stepdad threw a fit!  My brother was grounded for*ever*!  

I beat Jackal the following week.  Fuck yeah.

I finally made it to the final boss, and after fighting it for about a half hour and got it down to about 10% health, the game hard-locked on me. That was the final straw. I ejected the disc, shelved it, and never touched it again.

I'm up two with 20 seconds left when I get a steal at his three point line. Playing as the Thunder, I pass it up to Serge Ibaka who has absolutely no one in front of him. All I have to do is pass it 10 feet to him and he has a breakaway dunk to end it.

He drops it. Nobody near him. He just drops the ball and, despite being on top of it, can't get it. But my friend is able to have one of his players race over, pick the ball up, hit a three, and win. 

That game broke my spirit.  |-|

After my adventure i headed back to everlook to turn in. Some little fuckhead gnome warlock followed me and dotted me up JUST outside town. No problem i thought. Ill just turn around and whack this little lvl 58 homo to hell and back..... yeah that didn't happen. He fear bombed me for about 2 mins getting closer and closer to the guards until eventually i pulled guard aggro and got 1 hit while this little grease ball fuck legged it off into the snow..

No matter. Graveyard was close so i respawned to carry on my business.. all of a sudden here comes this little fuckstick again and fear bombs me into guards And runs off laughing. GUARDS DON'T CHASE HIM THOUGH WTF?!!? nope. just bend me over and pillage my asshole while this little prick sits on the road and watches me die.

After about the 15th time and over an hour later i snapped.....

I spun around on my office chair and fly kicked my wardrobe while my neck is getting whipped back from my headset. I must have looked like some fucked up kid trying a karate move on YouTube. It sat me on my ass and sent me into a fit of rage. I tore that headset right of my cranium and snapped that fucker into 3 pieces. They keyboard was next. Picked that prick up and power-slammed it over my knee so hard i ended up with 2 keyboards.

After realizing what id done and knew that i had no way of replacing my stuff because i was only 15 with no money i went into a second fit of rage. Screaming and yelling so hard i spewed on the carpet.

Glad my parents weren't home.

TLDR: Went full martial arts on my headset and keyboard and spewed on the ground cause i died. |-|

I'd get to the ledge, jump wrong, harry would die, and then i'd spend like 1-2 minutes getting back to the ledge just so that he could die again. What really infuriated me was how easy the section was, and the more I wasted my day trying to get past it the angrier I became. Yet despite my rage I was glued to the screen because the part was just SO. FUCKING. EASY. It ended when my parents ran in and turned the game off after they heard me screaming. I was in tears and hyperventilating. They had to carry me outside to get me to calm down.

|-| co8yq11 || 30 || City of Heroes, before the shutdown, had a story arc that was available called 'Who Will Die?'  It had, I think, 7 mission arcs for the whole story.  And while it probably isn't that big a secret, just in case it has designs on coming back (there are negotiations thereto currently taking place, pleasepleaseplease...)  I will spoiler the details:

[I want to say it was missions 5 and 6.  Mission 5 was a race to try to save/help Statesman, but Wade always beat you there, taking Statesman out.  The cutscene was poignant, and even though some felt he was a total ass, the Death of Statesman was a pretty powerful scene.  It royally pissed me off.  I was saddened, true, but I wanted Wade's ASS at that point.  I wanted to find his ass, and slowly kill him with a spoon.  Because it'd hurt more.  And be slow.  But what really ticked me off was Statesman being the arrogant jerk he was... he had basically gone awol and then confronted Wade... and he didn't need to DO that.  Damn you both.](/s)

[But that's not all.  The very next arc... [Mission sent you to some part of the cave system, which meant that Manticore and Sister Psyche were left at the little temple.  She gets caught in some sort of mind weapon, and unless she was killed, she would unleash a blast that would kill millions.  So of course, the choice was that Manticore, her husband, not long after being married a year or so ago, had to kill her himself. That was tragic, and just plain damn sad.  I still don't understand why that had to happen, honest, but.. there it is.  Villains for ya, I guess.](/s)

[Those two made me so angry.  The first was... well, I suppose it was to say 'nobody's invincible' and shake up the game... and frankly, the guy, well... there were opinions about him, I guess, so...](/s)

[But the second?  Ton of bricks when it happened.  I had expected the first.  But not the second.  And definitely not the way it happened.](/s)

I haven't been angry at a videogame before that.  They were always just games.  But CoH was different, so... yeah.  Got a little wrapped up in it, I guess. :|

Silly to some, sure, but hey... it's the only one I have, figured I'd say.  I'm not angry anymore.  I still don't believe it happened, in some way, because it's just so... sad.  Yeah.  That's it.

|-| co90g82 || 18 || Story time!!

While playing Crash Bandicoot back in the summer of 2001, because family was too poor for the new version that came out the same year. Anyways, there I am, sitting in the front room of my house gliding through the levels of the game. Thinking to myself *this game is way to easy... maybe I'm on a low difficulty*. If I recall correctly there wasn't any difficulty setting. 

Fast forwards a couple of days. I've just started the second to last level of Crash, excited to reach the end and celebrate (because children do that sort of thing). I'm about to complete this level. Everything is working out well. I can see the end. **DIES**

So I restart that level and try again. I get to the same point in the game and again... **DIES**

This goes on for about 30+ times with each **DIES** building a rage inside of me that a child should not have. 

Finally, the child version of myself reaches the point where I could no longer cope with this game. I grap the console and proceed to throw is to the wall. I pick up the now shattered PS1 and throw it back at the TV (which my family only had one of) and the screen smashes into millions of pieces. Back in those days, TV had, as I believe, some sort of liquid which covered the carpet in out main living room and soaked through, to the room below. This caused a massive damp patch on the ceiling below and no TV for a good week or so. The ceiling had to be re-plastered which according to my dad was "a hell of a lot of money".

Never played that game ever again.

TL;DR?
Smashed TV and PS1 cos I couldn't complete Crash Bandicoot. TV liquid spills on carpet and soaks ceiling which had to then get fixed. Family not happy as there is now no TV and downstairs is filled with workmen.

**DIES** |-|

It got to a head when he taunts you telling you that you need to feint, and me, being an experienced fencer, didn't take that very well. 1 wiimote through the wall and 1 slammed power button later, I still haven't beaten SS to this day. |-|

About 3 weeks into the game, I had beaten it dozens of times now, so I got ready for a no-deaths, or a no-bonfire, no gear, run. I decided to save time and do all three at the same time.

I died during the Queen fight with her at less than 10%. 

Last fucking boss in the game. 10% of her life left. No bonfires, no gear, no deaths, and I rolled myself run into death. It wasn't lag, or a glitch, or a sneeze. I just straight up killed myself.

I karatesmashed the Esc button, which broke the tiny thing which elevated my keyboard.

Was all down for Shepard dying, never expected Shepard to survive the whole ordeal, but that ending, coupled with the gaping plot holes and complete lack of an epilogue was...disappointing to say the least. Really, it felt like the entire last 10 minutes was handled by an entirely different story/dev team.

Majoras Mask - Great Fairys Sword - 14 years ago maybe?

Alright, so basically 10 or 11 year old me spent a shit load of time getting that big sword and eventually 100%'ing Majoras Mask. I don't remember how hard it was to get, shit, it could have taken 30 minutes, but for 10 year old me, it was a big deal.  I have only faint memories now of the events leading up to it, but I vaguely recall following my gamefaqs guide through and through, and eventually receiving the sword.

So anyway, I go to the menu to equip my glorious prize, and the goddamn thing wont work.  I cant use the sword, or its not showing up, or something.  I get frustrated.  I'm certain that I have the sword and I did everything correctly.  The game isn't letting me use the weapon.  I panic.  I get more frustrated.  Nothing is working and the game isnt letting me use it.

*Cringe moment ahead* 

I start crying.  I ask my mom if she will call Nintendo to find out if there is a glitch.

*Cringe moment over*

I realize probably 10 minutes later that you use those yellow buttons to equip and swing the sword, not the A button or whatever.

TLDR; I cried like a bitch because Majoras Mask decided to have the great fairys sword be a yellow button item. |-|

My senior maths teacher took a job with the district when he had a masters in mathematics simply because of the benefits. I believe that he finished his PhD because the school district paid for all of his educational costs.

He, also, became known in the town because he walked into a loggers bar and tried to pick up a woman. The loggers beat him up and put their caulks to him.

Later he was arrested in a nearby town for having a prostitute in his hotel room.

Then as we got older we would hear stories about the 'cool' rich kids who were trouble makers, and the rest of the plebs and realize that we went to a really great high school. 

Sure we had different social groups, but everyone was friends with everyone and nice to everyone. 

The only thing I ever saw go down was a race thing between some drunk girls at a dance. But it was a one time incident and that girl (white) who was the perpetrator, had dated a really nice black kid a few months before. She was probably just wasted and being a Dick.

"Geeks/outcasts" these days tend to mean people with poor social skills rather than above average intelligence or strange hobbies.  If you knew how to handle interactions with others and came across as chill, people rarely cared about how you amuse yourself.  People tended to respect intelligence from what I saw, as long as that also translated to social intelligence.    

Like the only way you really end up in the "geeks" pile is if people find it difficult to get along with you.  I was never a nerd perse, but I never really fit in that well either.  Looking back, I wouldn't have wanted to hang around teenage me either.    

I think some of the stereotypes definitely existed back in the '70s and '80s (who make up most of the people who produce the shows that showcased said stereotypes), but I think most of us grew up on shows with bullies, jocks, nerds, etc., and avoided falling into that trap as a result.    |-|

|-| co92grh || 24 || There was so few white people I was known as the white guy. |-| 
|-| co8ql9m || 220 || There was no bullying at my highschool whatsoever. Everyone was always really chill and happy, mostly because 90% of the school was stoned during the school day.  |-| 
|-| co8puqf || 644 || CATHOLIC SCHOOL IS NOT LIKE IT'S EVER DEPICTED! We weren't stuck up, we sure as fuck don't wear our uniforms everywhere, we knew how to party, and we had more hardcore drug users than inner city schools except all ours managed to get a diploma.  |-| 
|-| co8oja0 || 61 || Literally no bullying .. It was weird because in my primary school, there was a ton of it.  |-| 
|-| co8tb2k || 20 || The marching band was popular and respected, especially by the football team. They refused to walk onto the field unless the drumline was leading them out. |-| 
|-| co8t11j || 32 || I went to a magnet highschool. everyone was smart, then there were the super smart. I was normal level smart, and me and my friends sold acid and mdma |-| 
|-| co8pov4 || 84 || I went to a pretty small school (a little less than 40 in my class, and we were considered a big class), so there was a lot of overlap in the common cliches. Everyone had to be involved in everything. Captain of the football team? Probably also in FFA and speech. Head cheerleader? On the debate team, and graduated 3rd in the class. Me? I did Football, wrestling, track, FFA, explorers club, speech, and graduated 2nd in my class. So ya, there was a ton of overlap.

Also, everyone was generally cool with everyone else. It seriously took a fucking shit ton to get a majority of the class not to like you. |-| 
|-| co8s9bh || 14 || My school had an armoury and a firing range, which counts as pretty unusual in England... |-| 
|-| co90sa6 || 29 || The ugly girls weren't hot girls in glasses. They were just ugly. |-| 
|-| co92ded || 13 || The fat band geek won homecoming king. And to counter that my old teacher has been recently accused of sleeping with a student. |-| 
|-| co8q1jd || 67 || Went to an all boys school in Ireland one of the last state schools to have priests as teachers.
Priests were excellent engaging teachers. The career teachers were arseholes.

One of the Gaelic football recruiting schools, couldn't solo to save my life, no one cared treated great by the kids regardless

It helped that I was an under 16 martial arts champion for Ireland. |-| 
|-| co919mx || 55 || ITT: its not the 90's anymore and movies arent real and most people are nice |-| 
|-| co91697 || 12 || I was the weird kid. I deserved to be mercilessly bullied, considering how much of a chip-on-my-shoulder, twat-waffle I was. But everyone pretty civil to me. In fact, some days during lunch, which I normally ate alone, people would randomly come by, sit with me and chat. I'm not sure if I was just the school's agreed upon charity case, but I would have turned out a lot worse if people had decided to be assholes to me. |-| 
|-| co8y7zj || 161 || ITT: The people who didn't get bullied talk about how chill everyone was |-| 
|-| co8prjm || 18 || we didn't really have "cliques" and everyone for the most part was nice to each other.  |-| 
|-| co90gb8 || 19 || The food! Based on tv shows, especially Disney Channel ones, high school cafeterias and lunches looked pretty decent. Meanwhile my school lunches looked like this:

http://images.angelpub.com/2010/18/4573/school-lunches.jpg |-| 
|-| co8tvjr || 8 || I went to a very red neck high school in the south but the marching band/color guard were higher on the food chain than the football team and cheerleaders. It was glorious :)

Most ppl came to the football games for the halftime show. |-| 
|-| co8uxw8 || 8 || Our concert band was much more respected than our football team.  |-| 
|-| co92khv || 9 || All the attractive, rich, popular kids were in the show choir at our school.  Our show choir had won multiple national competitions and their trophies overshadowed any of the trophies generated by any of our sports teams.   |-| 
|-| co91qsv || 16 || For some reason our high school social ladder made no fucking sense.

Choir at the top, cheerleaders second to Poms, Football second to Basketball, which was tied for sports appreciation with Volleyball. Math Team was the shit and had like 100 + people in it. No one gave a shit about Soccer.

About 90% of people could talk to anyone without it being awkward, and over 1/2 the of the smartest kids in the grade were full blown stoners and partied like mad. It was like some sort of High school musical/21Jump Street crossover. |-| 
|-| co8q8po || 8 || No bullying, everyone was fairly intelligent, no pregnant chicks. |-| 
|-| co8rfmq || 7 || The cool kids all played Starcraft Broodwar and Diablo 2 |-| 
|-| co8wlea || 7 || We had no sports at all. It was an "arts integrated" charter school, so our phys ed class was dance. |-| 
|-| co8okdq || 66 || My school was and still is one of the biggest schools in the UK, despite the fact it's located in a tiny little town. It was weird, I went there in the early 2000's. We never had pregnant kids first of all. Don't get me wrong everybody was sexually active, perhaps too sexually active for a 15 year old, but nobody got pregnant. The cool kids were in fact the nerds, and people like me, the arrogant cool nerds got through school even easier. Been a sport fanatic, rich or funny did not make you cool at my school. Although drugs were popular, they were not respected or though of as cool. If you took drugs, you were immediately branded an idiot. I enjoyed school, I think it suited my personality well and if I went elsewhere I would have been a super loser.  |-| 
|-| co8xu4h || 6 || The marching band was actually "cool" and gathered more attention than the football team. |-| 
|-| co91wfg || 6 || The jocks were nice, the nerds were assholes  |-| 
|-| co94cie || 6 || It was cool to be in the school band and you were looked down upon if you weren't a part of it. Our cheerleaders were hideous and the cheer leading squad was heavily looked down upon by the majority of the student body. Also it was pretty much assumed that you were going to college and any diversion from that path was criticized.  |-| 
|-| co8qp8e || 5 || My high school had about 4,000 kids. Meaning that there weren't clicks that ran the school, or the one kid who ate in the bathroom. Also the size had not that many care about sports or going to school dances. Also my year in theater did not have a single homosexual in it.  |-| 
|-| co8ty64 || 5 || The guy that was voted most athletic was also a thespian. I myself was in choir and drama while also playing on the basketball and volleyball teams. I would sing the national anthem before games while in uniform. There wasn't really a nerd stigma on the arts in my HS. 

I graduated in 2000 for reference. Before there was "nerd chic" |-| 
|-| co8v9yp || 5 || The football team wasn't that great, but our musical theater program was one of the best in the state. All the popular kids (some of whom also played football) were in the shows. |-| 
|-| co92hp5 || 6 || I went to trade school and everyone acted pretty much like an adult there was no "cool" kids groups or any bullying really.

But then again when you give a bunch of 14-18 year old's powertools and torches people tend to have respect for each other lol  |-| 
|-| co92l5b || 5 || No freshmen were stuffed into trash cans, was severely disappointed  |-| 
|-| co9bvi8 || 5 || Last years valedictorian took 6 AP classes and was captain of the soccer team. Biggest pothead you could throw a rock at. Actually got caught blazing up in a parking lot. This years valedictorian takes 6 AP classes, captain of the football team, second biggest pothead you can throw a rock at.  |-| 
|-| co8opca || 113 || Well Steve Irwins kids went to my school in Australia, Crikey mate. |-| 
|-| co8qlyi || 10 || Went to highschool in the 80s. No one dressed like [this](http://www.hercampus.com/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_embed/public/2014/02/02/sweaterneck_411431.jpg?itok=LGUqfTgv) or [this](http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/ratt11.jpg), everyone dressed like [this](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/131544_0217_ful.jpg).  |-| 
|-| co8trfs || 4 || The band students are really popular. Like, the rest of the school actually enjoyed having the band do stuff as opposed to just dealing with. Started being like this after the old molester band director left/got arrested. |-| 
|-| co8zmt7 || 3 || Went to a school in the ghetto. Everyone was pretty chill and accepting of everyone. There was no cliques, popular people etc.  |-| 
|-| co92kn9 || 4 || I ate lunch with a player, a pothead, and a neanderthal. We eventually learned to solve Rubik's cubes and would spend lunch hour talking about it. No one ever gave us crap.  |-| 
|-| co92nc8 || 4 || Our football team wasn't a bunch of bullies.  In fact, some of *them* were bullied.  By the baseball team.

EDIT: our football team was woefully terrible.  They went 1-9 my senior year, and 3-7 the year before.  The longtime coach retired a few years before, and they kept filling the vacancy with PE teachers who hadn't coached football outside Pop Warner because of budget cuts.  Plus, recruiting for the team wasn't great, I know one of the kids transfered to a neighboring high school because their team was better (and the high school poached him from us, which is *kinda* illegal according to the rules of the governing high school sports commission, but good luck in having them actually enforce anything.) One of the defensive ends on the team actually played roller hockey with us, and preferred hockey to football, but he had a better chance of getting some kind of scholarship in football than roller hockey.

The baseball team, on the other hand, was always qualifying for state championships, and we had several players drafted from our high school to the pros (and we've had several players actually make it to the MLB.). The old manager for them used to play in the minor leagues, and was the highest paid employee in the school district at the time.  The team was mostly rich kids, and took great delight in bullying everyone who wasn't "in" with the baseball team.  This included nerds, the band, theatre students (which included me), and ultimately the football team.  Hell, one of them actually shoved our starting quarterback into the trash, in front of half the school during lunch.  The guys on the baseball team were a piece of work.

TL;DR: horrible football team bullied by state champion baseball team. |-| 
|-| co92o3y || 4 || Smart, attractive people that were awkward and didn't play sports. |-| 
|-| co93rlg || 4 || Bullying didnt happen like in the movies. Usually when one is bullied he fights and just gets beat down. We didnt have nerds like pimple faced nerds and all that. Also no sex parties....nobody puts out in lebanon.  |-| 
|-| co95aae || 4 || The Catholic highschool I went to has a higher Atheist population than you would think. |-| 
|-| co95pdc || 4 || The theater kids were popular....and complete elitist assholes |-| 
|-| co95sbs || 4 || I was the most popular kid..... Because i was homeschooled |-| 
|-| co8qjz7 || 6 || The worst students were the ones in the Advanced classes. Guess where I was stuck :(

I really didn't get involved in any "groups" so I was pretty oblivious to everything going on, apart from what happened right in the classroom. |-| 
|-| co8r1w0 || 3 || nobody spontaneously started singing or dancing. |-| 
|-| co8tw21 || 3 || The cheerleaders were ugly. |-| 
|-| co8vl35 || 3 || We didn't have a football team or cheerleaders. We did have a great soccer team and an amazing drama dept. Actually the Drama Kids were the cool, pretty kids at my school. |-| 
|-| co8vmk6 || 3 || The marching band is more popular than the football team. |-| 
|-| co8yv7t || 3 || I never saw or heard of any physical bullying. I'm sure verbal bullying existed, but any fight that occurred was between two equally matched people who were both willing to fight. And after the fight they would be all good with each other |-| 
|-| co90o9y || 3 || My high school was too big for any one stereotype to fit. 

We had smart popular kids, we had dumb popular kids. 

We had popular kids who did theater, band, choir, or sports. Some kids did more than one thing.

We had punks and goths and preps and jocks.

We had good teachers, we had bad teachers. We had a teacher get fired for messing around with students, we had a teacher who had been at the school so long he was teaching his ex-student's kids.

I would be much more surprised to find a school that actually STUCK to the cliches and stereotypes. |-| 
|-| co91b0u || 3 || Before games, our hockey team clacks their sticks together and conjugates in Latin. |-| 
|-| co91yrf || 3 || No one ever randomly started singing and dancing in the hallways... I was disappointed. |-| 
|-| co9214k || 3 || All girls school. Never saw a fight. |-| 
|-| co92fu8 || 3 || The majority of people were very friendly. There was a group of "popular" people but they all hung out with other people and were nice to everyone. |-| 
|-| co92hbs || 3 || Honestly, my hs is exactly like it is depicted in movies.. Clicks and everything. But the girls are all divided, while guys are somewhat cool with each other. Popular kids are smart for the most part.  |-| 
|-| co92wp0 || 3 || Our valedictorian is the prettiest, smartest, *nicest* girl! Everyone loves her. Now she's a cheerleader  and super trendy at a prestigious university. 

The second ranked girl is super smart, obviously, but also an amazing artist. She's off at art school now.  |-| 
|-| co92xpy || 3 || Most of the stereotypical "jocks" were also really smart. Probably because sports scholarships aren't a thing in Canada  |-| 
|-| co92y4i || 3 || Popular kids were friendly, nice and smart. Less popular kids were less so. |-| 
|-| co93irx || 3 || I go to a private school of about 60 per class and there was never any bullying and the lunches were served on ceramic dishes and we had actual metal utencials  |-| 
|-| co93jtr || 3 || Absolutely nothing. The jocks are meatheads, the professors kids are all smart, and the stoners are stoners. Think freaks and geeks.  |-| 
|-| co942nn || 3 || I went to a small school; there was no 'popularity'.  Everyone was popular (except the Magic the Gathering kids). |-| 
|-| co94mpp || 3 || smart kids were to be envied and even had an elite sort of club that everyone respected |-| 
|-| co95ai3 || 3 || All of the band kids are the cool ones. |-| 
|-| co95bw9 || 3 || We had 400 students and 100 of them were in band.  |-| 
|-| co95cng || 3 || We had 179 students total, existed inside of another school, did not take the Regents because the school didn't believe that standardized testing was an effective way of measuring intelligence or learning. Instead we presented a project of everything we've learned in the past 4 years for the subjects that the Regents covered to a panel of two teachers and an outside observer and was assessed on that. Also we called our teachers by their first names, we had a "Town Meeting" session once a week where the entire school would get together and catch up on current events, listen to guest speakers cover world events like the genocide in Rwanda, etc. Classes weren't separated by grades, kind of like in college, and many students enjoyed staying after school just to hang out with the teachers until closing time. It was some of the best times of my life growing up.  |-| 
|-| co95j97 || 3 || Almost everyone was in the chess club.

Really all that meant was that during our free period there was a box of chess sets in the cafeteria that anyone could play with, but almost everyone would play chess. We all started picking up opening gambits and stuff like that. It was pretty random. Granted it was a small private all boys school, but still. |-| 
|-| co95one || 3 || The band kids &amp; drama club kids were the cool ones. We basically had a football team so the band had a reason to perform weekly. |-| 
|-| co96dzf || 3 || We still had some cliques, but in general, everyone was pretty nice to each other.  There really wasn't a "popular" group, though we did have a "richer and better-looking than average" group, and they were nice, too.  

Except for Ashley.  Ashley was a dick. |-| 
|-| co96rtq || 3 || My school had no super popular, or super intelligent, or super sporty cliques. Wait, my school had no girls at all. Oh yeah. |-| 
|-| co97qau || 3 || Theatre (they were adamant about the British spelling) kids were revered. We liked our football team, but everyone knew the theatre kids names. They also got laid often. I'm certain it happened in character sometimes. I was friends with one of them who showed me texts from people like "hey, we can hook up if you want. No pressure, just letting you know I'm down."

There's an awesome culture surrounding theatre and speech, I think at a lot of high schools. The teachers would always get me into the field trips on the DL since I wasn't technically involved. I've got some good stories.  |-| 
|-| co97r5b || 3 || Probably a good third of the school was part of some music program. We had 4 concert bands, 3 orchestras, 3 choirs, 5 jazz bands, 4 show choirs, and 200+ kids in the volunteer marching band. So being in band was definitely not the social death sentence that it's usually considered. Actually my stand partner in the top level concert band for alto saxophone was also the captain of our poms squad, and the fact that practicing music could be cool and a social thing to do was really great because kids who would otherwise not have learned music decided to pick up an instrument.  |-| 
|-| co98slr || 3 || There wasn't really any fighting or bullying.  When a rare fight would break out the football/wrestling team would usually step in and break it up. |-| 
|-| co99hsq || 3 || All the football players were really nice to everyone. But the baseball team were assholes |-| 
|-| co99i9v || 3 || Years before Glee, the cool kids were in both choir and theater. |-| 
|-| co99mfd || 3 || Our suburban football team did have just one black kid on it - but he was the punter. |-| 
|-| co99ny3 || 3 || Bullying was generally met with swift and severe consequences from other students. No one put up with that crap. |-| 
|-| co99pdw || 3 || The preppy kids and the ghetto kids got along and would joke around together, there was no culture clash or seperation.  |-| 
|-| co99zjk || 3 || My HS didn't really have bullying. I mean, I'm sure there was some level that I wasn't aware of but it was taken very seriously by the faculty and students. People really would come to the defense of someone they didn't know, or would grab a teacher if anything was happening. I never saw a single fight in HS either, and things normally associated with the victims of bullying were considered cool (choir/orchestra/band, AP classes, art, etc). 

Shit, I remember that there was this super goth kid (eyeliner, chains, the full shabang) that wasn't exactly popular but was generally thought of as a nice guy. Anyhoo, he got attacked by some kids at the local college for being gay. Students at my school set up a fundraiser for him to help with hospital costs and it raised over five hundred bucks iirc (not bad for high schoolers imo). 

And we weren't a small school per se....about 1500 students. Also, this was in Idaho so not exactly a wealthy or well funded school.  |-| 
|-| co9abwl || 3 || We had a lot of special needs students at my high school and the football team made it a point to protect every single of of them. They were always hanging out together at lunch. Two of the students with autism also won Senior homecoming King and Queen. |-| 
|-| co9b2rx || 4 || The Duke of Edinburgh Award club was the most popular club.

Seriously about 90% of the school was in that club, and it was completely optional.

  |-| 
|-| co9b4g1 || 3 || Everyone in my high school seemed to get along great with the each other and there were no real social groups like the stereotype ones you see in movies and stuff. Everyone was pretty much the same. |-| 
|-| co9b6bu || 3 || My school doesn't have cliques, it is racially accepting and not ghetto. We have no neckbeards and the expectation is to be respectful and not exclude, and that expectation is followed |-| 
|-| co9bi6c || 3 || Attractive people contrary to what teen movies wanted us to believe were very nice.  |-| 
|-| co9bm85 || 3 || World famous robotics team. No football team. |-| 
|-| co9g8mc || 3 || Our class valedictorian partied harder than anyone in the school. Went on to build jet engine transmissions. He also got his nipple pierced today because the Patriots won and he lost a bet. He is the dumbest smart person I know.  |-| 
|-| co8p9jz || 4 || The cool kids were in band.  |-| 
|-| co8pjl5 || 4 || Went to a school of about 1400 students which is massive where I am from. It was the nerdiest school.

Our school band was way bigger than any of our sports teams and won all kinds of awards. Our school musicals were one of the biggest events of the year, with a huge amount of student involvement. There were still "cliques" and "popular kids" but the group who met the stereotypes of the popular kids were just like any other clique at the school. There really weren't any social hierarchies. There was still bullying and things but most people kind of belonged to a web of different cliques and people were kind of friends with a bunch of people from a bunch of different groups.

The way I see highschool in media are that there are all these clear cut groups of people, and there still were at my school, but they were all kind of blurred and everyone intermingled.

Also when I was there we won some award and were recognized as being the most LGBT friendly school in the province. Not that people weren't still discriminated against, but it definitely was better than most schools I'd say. |-| 
|-| co8qg36 || 3 || My high school didn't really have a popular group or clique.  And the cliques we did have were extremely flexible and inviting.  Like someone on the varsity football team also being really good friends with someone from the Math Club.  I was in the JROTC program (one of the programs that was considered kind of a program for social outcasts, but it didn't really have social outcasts in it) but I still was dating a very attractive blonde on the soccer team.  I think this was due to the school being quite large and VERY academically focussed.  I don't know why being focussed on academics would be a factor, but the other "dumber" schools in the district had small exclusive cliques and the "popular crowd" too. |-| 
|-| co9eb1n || 3 || the stoners scored the highest on AP tests. |-| 
|-| co8qebu || 3 || I doubt most schools had the my little pony, trench coat wearing, gallon of tea carrying, army bullet around their neck, who had a pimp for the freaky girls, group. And yes, that was one single group I described  |-| 
|-| co8rkpn || 3 || Nobody gives a shit about the sports teams unless they're on the sports teams. About 2/3 of the crowd at our football games are there to see the band perform at halftime. Band+theater was where you wanted to be for lots of friends and popularity. 

Also, none of the guardies wanted to be cheerleaders. I'm not sure where that stereotype comes from, but cheer and guard are very different things and the guard girls usually came from dance backgrounds (the dance team at our school is really bad and everyone hates the coach), while the cheer squad came from volleyball/fockey cuts.  |-| 
|-| co94jvj || 3 || My hometown is extremely rural and is in one of the poorest counties in our Midwestern state. The whole town is less than 800 people. Despite that, my high school had:    

- unbiased and comprehensive SexEd with an emphasis on contraception methods and their effectiveness, as well as open discussions about options for unplanned pregnancy from abortion to adoption.  
- a state of the art (at the time ~15 years ago) auditorium with seating for 300 and full stage, lights and sound for concerts and plays   
- a popular and engaging school music program with guest conductors and university-level band clinics.   
- over a million dollars of college scholarship funds available   
- an active group of retired teachers who would meet at the library after school to help kids with homework or just talk to them about their day.   


I really hated growing up there but now as an adult I can see how many people in the community work hard to make it better and give the kids there every opportunity to do something with themselves.  |-| 
|-| co94ohs || 3 || This'll probably get buried but my high school was a junior high/high combined (grades 7-12) and we had no classes. There were 23 kids in the whole school and my graduating class was 5. I took german and mandarin and tango as electives. Literally no cliches existed in our school.  |-| 
|-| co8pvi5 || 3 || Everyone at my school was sort of the nerdiest people from our community jumbled in to a good charter school, so many cliché things didn't really apply to us.  All of the popular people were super nice and in the top of their class,  the "slut"  of the school was super involved with its community,  even on outside-of-vagina terms,  and the only real shitty people that went there were terrible ugly, fucking senseless,  and even got quite a bit of gruff from the teachers.  There has only been  two teen pregnancies in its 13 or so years of existence as well.  I've helped with exactly 50% of them.  |-| 
|-| co8pz71 || 3 || I'm from a small town in New York with plenty of money, a weak sports program and a strong theater program. As a result, it wasn't uncommon for star athletes to also perform in the school musicals. It was also the kind of town that nobody really left, so the majority of kids I graduated with, I started with in kindergarten. Because of this, typical cliques like "jock, nerd, etc" didn't really exist to the extent that it exists in other schools. |-| 
|-| co8p9k8 || 268 || "You're not as green as you are cabbage looking"  |-| 
|-| co8qps7 || 688 || "No Dar Papaya" in Colombia. Literally, Don't give the papaya. 

It means "Putting yourself in a position where someone can take advantage of you"

For example: You were sitting in a restaurant, left your bag unattended and someone took it from you, because you gave the papaya.  |-| 
|-| co8r0ic || 120 || Y'alld've (You all would have) |-| 
|-| co8rugs || 1300 || "Worst case Ontario"
 |-| 
|-| co8tvfb || 310 || "There is no bad weather, only bad clothing"

(Finnes ikke dårlig vær, bare dårlige klær)

 |-| 
|-| co8rk5j || 637 || "Fixin'" as in "I'm fixin' to make y'all a wonderful peach cobbler."  

Means "about to" and people around me love to say it. |-| 
|-| co8tgwh || 1864 || "Go fuck yourself." I'm from New Jersey. |-| 
|-| co8tdmo || 291 || We have loads here in the North West of England, but I only realise they're localised when I get that blank expression from people from elsewhere! Some of them might be pan-British, or global even.

A couple I like are 'Running around like a blue-arsed fly', which  means 'very busy'. In the same vein as 'what did your last slave die of?' sometimes we say 'Stick a brush up my arse and I'll sweep the floor as well', in protest to somebody being overly bossy.

A few nice weather related ones spring to mind; 'it's cracking the flags' means 'it's very hot', as in hot enough to crack paving stones. 'It's brass monkeys' means 'it's very cold', short for 'cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey'. Older folk sometimes say they're 'starving of cold', too, or just 'starving' which can be confusing.

If somebody leaves a door open with a draft blowing you might tell them to 'put t' wood in th'ole' (put the wood in the hole'), but they might respond by telling you to stop being so 'nesh' (overly sensitive to cold/wet weather).
 |-| 
|-| co8p9b7 || 2211 || "Cunt's fucked."

It means 'This is not working properly.' |-| 
|-| co8t4n2 || 509 || "Lord willing and the creek don't rise." Meaning if all goes well. Rural Virginia. |-| 
|-| co8qfo8 || 86 || "Shit floats". Spain.

I think it says something about us lol. |-| 
|-| co8rpw1 || 425 || "Get fucked!" means "I am very surprised by this information" in Australia.

If someone calls you mate, they're probably calling you a cunt. If someone calls you a cunt, they're probably your mate. Or you're just a cunt. |-| 
|-| co8qo2e || 968 || "Si pesa mas que un pollo, me lo follo."

Spanish saying which basically says that if it weighs more than a chicken, you should fuck it. |-| 
|-| co8t929 || 348 || I go to college in Minnesota, the biggest disparity is that they call a casserole a "Hot Dish" and they play "Duck, Duck, Grey Duck" instead of duck, duck, goose. |-| 
|-| co8pmh4 || 423 || Jawn(s)

Anything and everything.  |-| 
|-| co8rewh || 2383 || "Happy Birthday!"

Commonly used towards the person on their birthday. |-| 
|-| co8rmw2 || 199 || My absolute favorite:  **“Misli da je uhvatio Boga za muda”** which means **“He thinks he grabbed God’s balls”**. We use it when somebody's acting too important. Bosnia(and probably Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro too) |-|

Meaning: "It is broken/ruined."

Origin (at least what I can vaguely remember): During the middle ages, soap was something that was brought back to western Europe from the crusades in the middle east. Because many would never return home, "going to get soap" became synonymous with death/ruin. |-|

About 3 months after moving, I was having a conversation where I told the person "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth". They had no idea what I was talking about, which stunned me.

|-| co8rc0d || 59 || Literally, "fuck your mother's stinky pussy"

In Guangzhou, it's a pretty common "filler phrase" used at the end of sentences and is never really targeting at anyone in an aggressive manner. A common conversation would go along the lines of:

A: So where did you go this holiday?
B: Man, I was stuck in traffic, fuck your mom's stinky pussy.

|-| co99kgf || 3 || "Se tá no inferno, abraça o capeta" 

This is brazilian portuguese for "if you're in hell, just hug the devil", meaning: if you're already in a very bad situation there's little point in making lots of effort to make it just a little bit less bad. Embrace it and take advantage of it. 

Ex.: you walked 10 miles to the bus station to take the bus to get home, but you realize you're only 4 miles from home now. Just keep walking, forget the bus. You're in hell, now hug the devil. 

Variants on the same theme:

- "Se tá na lama, haja como porco" 

(if you're in the mud, behave like a pig) 

Or a more gross version:

- "O que é um peido pra quem tá cagado?" 

(What's a fart for someone who shat his pants?) 


More Brazilian sayings:

- "Quem desdenha quer comprar" 

"he who disdains wants to buy it"

Meaning: if someone say bad things about something too much, he probably likes it. 

- "de boas intenções o inferno está cheio" 

"hell is full of people that had good intentions"

Meaning: it doesn't matter if intentions were good if the result is bad. 

- "não coloco a mão no fogo por isso"

"I don't put my hand in the fire for that" 

Meaning: I don't trust that this will work. Or maybe: I don't trust that person. 

- "pimenta no cu dos outros é refresco" 

This would be tough to translate but it is used to criticize someone that takes advantage of another person's bad situations, or maybe just laughs at it. It means something like:

 "what feels like chili peppers sauce in that person's asshole for you feels like a refreshing beverage".

|-| co8szyy || 93 || First kiss. It was in the freezing cold at a shit party with a girl that i'm pretty sure is using me to get back at her ex, but the flipside is that it's overwith so i won't feel pressured/nervous when it comes to making out with someone i feel more comfortable with. |-| 
|-| co8qkrb || 185 || I ditched my truck on the highway for the first time last night. Roads looked fine until I hit a patch of ice, spun 360° and slid right into the snow filled median.

Also was my first 911 call ever. |-| 
|-| co8riyu || 465 || First time taking a risk in my life. I have always been quite straight with my life and doing what was expected. So after school went to university, did a master, got a respectable office job and got promoted. I hated every moment of being in the office doing really meanial tasks. So I quit my job to become a dog walker. I am not going to be paid as much but I love dogs and I think I will be much happier being outside with dogs than sitting at a desk all day. We will find out!

Edit: Thank you reddit for the kind words of encouragement. There have been times I have wondered if this was the right choice but hearing all of this from all of you has made me feel reassured that I am doing the right thing.   |-|

|-| co8tarx || 34 || First time taking college seriously.

Started skipping classes as an EE major. Led to failing grades in Diff EQ and Java courses. Put on academic probation. Didn't take it to heart. Continued skipping classes. Asked to leave the university. 

Then it finally hit. If I want a career, I should put forth the effort.

Switched colleges. Picked up a new science major. Haven't missed a class in three semesters. Finished one internship, got an interview for another in two days. Averaging a 3.85 GPA, and looking to graduate next spring. |-|

Ive been out for a bit now and such but i had never been to many places just full of people like me, where I don't have to worry what people think about what im drinking or if i dance like a queen or question if every cute boy is straight or not. Never had so much fun in a bar in my life, i always just figured that bars werent for me- turns out i was just in the wrong ones.  
I also recently had homophobic things yelled at me by a stranger for the first time, that was alright i guess but not nearly as fun.  |-|

|-| co8rw3b || 24 || First time going to an anime convention; also first time sitting in on a panel. The panel was fantastic. And I loved seeing all the great (and not so great but still wholehearted) cosplays everywhere. It makes me want to cosplay, too!

Of course, you had to navigate around the 12-year-olds here and there and stay away from the massive BO areas, but if you did that, you were good.  |-|

|-| co8td4d || 22 || I just got my first apartment.  |-| 
|-| co8rjnm || 88 || I ate my first twinkie a few days ago. I live in the UK so they are not normally sold here but Zombieland and Family Guy and other shows have led me to believe they are glorious. I have spent many years wanting to eat one.

An American-imported-"candy"-shop opened up locally and I went and visited and bought one.

Oh my fucking god. Do the company that make them just pay lots of money for them to be featured in films as something desirable? The bready-outside was sweeter than the inside. How the fuck does that work?

I gave it to a squirrel but it ate a bit, looked at me like I'd just ran over his family, threw it on the ground and fucked off. |-|

|-| co8rf8h || 37 || First time I put a pinball machine in my house. 1978 playboy machine. |-| 
|-| co8qndd || 66 || I started an AmeriCorps term last September.  The first thing we did was go to a camp in the middle of nowhere for our initial training.  I picked up three other women that I'd never met before at my house to drive two hours to said camp.

The drive down was fine, we were getting along fine, until we got past the small town near the camp, and hit gravel road.  I got turned around at one point, got back on the way, when we saw a very non-descript sign that said HILL.

We all had a good chuckle over it ("Really?  A sign that says "HILL"?) until we actually came to the hill...it was no hill.  It was a very steep decline into a valley, on gravel that was fairly loose and dry.  

I didn't realize my brakes were as bad as they were until I started driving down the hill.  I rode them all the way down, knuckle white until we got to the bottom.  It was the first time I was so responsible for the lives of other people, especially practical strangers.  One wrong move and we could have been seriously injured or even killed.

We obviously made it, and I got my brakes fixed, but I was sure glad I had driven--I have 21 years of driving under my belt; some of my colleagues are only a year or two older than that.  I had enough sense and experience not to panic too much...but I was definitely glad to get to the bottom.  I told them about it later, and we are all super tight now, but my mindset going down was "Holy shit, I just met these people two hours ago and now I have to try not to kill us." |-| 
|-| co8qgws || 19 || Made peanut butter fudge for the first time over the holidays, couldn't find my candy thermometer, but it stil came out perfect. |-|

It was awesome.  |-| 
|-| co8uxnc || 35 || My most recent "first" was doing a naked skydive for the first time. Never would've imagined I'd ever do that but when a hot girl wants to do that with me it's kinda hard to say no. |-| 
|-| co8vamf || 18 || I slid off of the road for the first time today. I'm used to driving in the snow, but I ended up sliding sideways while attempting to drive down a straight road. 


Luckily someone noticed me as it happened and pulled me out of the ditch, for free.  |-| 
|-| co99a4c || 31 || Fingered my girlfriend and got head from her. I'm a virgin and had never done anything more than kiss a girl  |-|

|-| co91x56 || 31 || First time making my girlfriend cum twice in the same...um..event (what do we call this?). Had her in the kitchen bent over the counter. It was pretty awesome. It got to the point that her legs started to give out from underneath her and I had to sort of hold her up as this was going on. Was a pretty good time.  |-| 
|-| co8scuu || 65 || First time being a mom and all that includes.  |-| 
|-| co8sq74 || 15 || This is relatively insignificant but I volunteered to play in a local football match/soccer game and I was terrified because I have zero coordination and have not been anywhere near team sports for years but it was fun as hell. Everyone, go play football/soccer if you can! Camaraderie, fitness, happiness, the works.  |-| 
|-| co8y4xr || 15 || First time having sex. The whole act is over hyped but the joy you get from making your partner feel good is much better than any pleasure you get. Also vagina's actually do feel like your cheek, i was wondering if that was true.   |-| 
|-| co8qvog || 14 || i had to deal with blizzards support for thhe first time 2 days ago. someone stole my battle.net account 3 years ago and i only just found out. i figured it would be as painful as any other support system, but they were helpful and easy to handle. after 3 hours they managed to transfer my old account back to me. |-| 
|-| co8v0ad || 14 || I think I just found my first white hair! I'm not even 30 yet! Maybe it was blonde...  It's normal for Asian hair to turn blonde as we age right? |-| 
|-| co8rj92 || 47 || First time I haven't given a single fuck of what people think of me, I'm starting to realize how happy this makes me feel! :)  |-| 
|-| co8q9d2 || 13 || First time eating birthday M&amp;Ms... They were stale and gross |-| 
|-| co8s37p || 24 || First time I've ever been laid off in twenty two years of working. This happened two months ago and I'm still taking it easy. I haven't had many vacations in that time period so I might as well relax while I can before jumping back into things. I'm a programmer and jobs are plentiful in my area so I'm not worried about finding a new job. 

Emotionally I was a little stunned the day it happened, but then relieved because I was really growing to hate my job. I had only been there about 1.5 years and I ignored warning signs (people leaving and not being replaced, upper management not having a good grasp on how to scale the business, multiple higher ups making statements about the company's health, etc) so I have no one to blame but myself for still being there when they started tightening the belt. I have been a little pissed off at one VP in particular because he thought he was a cutting edge coder and insisted we use his libraries to do certain things. This guy wouldn't check code in or out correctly, he wouldn't listen to reason when people proposed better approaches to new problems, and I honestly think he's the primary cause of the company being in the present state. But even that little anger passed. He's stubborn but he wasn't a horrible guy, and his skills were ok. 

I think the next three months are going to be me working out every day, learning some new skills, and then starting a job search refreshed in body and mind around May.  |-| 
|-| co8v5hy || 22 || I went to the gun range for the first time last week. Also, first time firing a handgun. Addicting. Expensive. |-| 
|-| co8xz19 || 12 || I'm 25 and just passed my driving test 2 weeks ago (late learner) and recently drove all by myself from my house to the train station completely unaccompanied. It was amazing and terrifying at the same time - I've had so many nightmares about driving in strange conditions my whole life e.g. having to reach the pedals from the passenger seat and then being chased by police, that it seems so surreal that not only am I legally allowed to be driving, but I'm actually competent at it!

EDIT: I can drive but can't spell pedals apparently. |-|

|-| co920pk || 9 || First time eating 20 bagel bites in a day... |-| 
|-| co8pttn || 24 || I had lactose free mik the other day for the first time. Regular milk makes me extremely uncomfortable, gut cramps etc.  |-| 
|-| co8t7dk || 37 || So, this weekend I took the virginity of the woman I've been dating. This in and if itself is just not that interesting. What begins to make it relevant is that she is in her late thirties. She grew up in a very liberal area and went to an all women's college, only recently in her life did she decided that she was attracted to men and began questioning if she was naturally a lesbian or had just been brought up that way. Hopefully she decides she likes me enough to keep dating. 

Tl;Dr 40 year old vigin no more |-| 
|-| co8qsjp || 16 || I met his parents. Haven't had that experience for twelve years. I flew by myself last October for the first time ever. And shooting guns, and being around them.  That was a first in many, many years. And am currently going through the first time selling a house.  |-|

|-| co8w0df || 6 || I've eaten so many delicious veggies in the past few weeks. So many new textures and flavors, I can't believe I was missing out!!

When I was younger, we got creamed spinach, steamed (to death) cauliflower with american cheese and corn. And, according to my mother, I loved veggies. Haha, yea... |-|

Cats require less maintenance and reddit surely made me into a cat guy. |-|

|-| co8rpj6 || 5 || Falling in love / first serious relationship. 
Never had much interest in anyone to actually consider dating. But I'm glad I gave it a shot because I couldn't be happier!  |-| 
|-| co8vsdo || 5 || Recently had my first ring fight. I've fought a few times on mats but being in the ring has a totally different atmosphere. It felt amazing. |-| 
|-| co8xmpf || 5 || First time going to a Fogo de Chao.  Holy shit.  More meat per second than a gay strip club.   |-| 
|-| co974z7 || 5 || After 8 years of burning curiosity my best friend (another woman) and I got shitfaced and finally managed to seduce each other.I  was always hesitant because we're such good friends and I didnt want to mess that up. We had a great time, woke up the next morning, laughed about it and thats it. Sorry to include a sex story, but after 30 years of knob gobbling it was quite an experience. |-| 
|-| co98rdy || 5 || First relationship at 23. Both of us are experiencing all the firsts together. Had my first double date last night. |-| 
|-| co91hgk || 13 || First time crying on my boyfriend's shoulder.

I'm a little worried that he thinks less of me or sees me as less of a man now. |-| 
|-| co8pww4 || 9 || May be not the first time ever, but it was my first time in a long time to have fun. |-| 
|-| co8rmd8 || 4 || On friday it was the first day I legitimately care about someone's life success. Normally I dont give a single fuck about anyone's life but i guess i do really care about this person |-| 
|-| co8wm17 || 4 || First time going on a diet.

I ate anything I wanted my whole life.  Now I'm not eating sugar and starch.  Not a single grain of rice, or piece of fruit for over a month now.  Feeling great, lost about 15lbs.  But I really miss sandwiches..... |-| 
|-| co901j9 || 5 || First time to drive a car and I'm almost 22. 

WHY DOES THE CAR MOVE WHEN I'M NOT STEPPING ON THE GAS? HOW CAN PEOPLE ALWAYS CHECK THEIR MIRRORS? HOW DO I STAY ON MY SIDE OF THE ROAD? It was mildly frightening and very exhilerating. |-| 
|-| co925hh || 4 || Today I found out that I'm officially under 200 lbs.  First time since Highschool.

God damn, first time I've ever lost weight in my entire *life.*

I don't look too overweight because I'm tall enough, but holy shit I can't believe I lost 60 lbs since March.  Not bad, seeing as I changed my diet just because of my blood pressure/cholesterol was a little high.  I had given up on trying to lose weight altogether, so I didn't even think about it.  It's just been about being more heart healthy.  

For the first few months I thought my clothes were just worn out.  When I realized I might be losing weight I didn't want to jinx it, so I just haven't checked.  Today at my physical I had a little peek.  195, and improvements across the board health wise! |-| 
|-| co92p77 || 4 || I took two dicks at once last night. |-| 
|-| co97mlo || 4 || My girlfriend and I had a pregnancy scare, and for the first time in my life I would have been totally okay if she was. I'm gonna marry this girl. |-|

|-| co986bz || 4 || I watched the movie "Tammy" for the first time this weekend. And the last time.  |-| 
|-| co989k3 || 4 || First time realising what I've been experiencing have actually been orgasms.

Backstory: was always told by friends that I would "definitely know" and "if you have to ask it wasn't an orgasm" and made me believe that orgasms were massive fireworks inducing pleasure bombs. 

Watched a documentary on female masturbation 3yrs after being sexually active that had a sex specialist type person saying many women don't know that what they are experiencing is actually an orgasm, and another woman said "some are mind blowing, and others are nothing special". 

That's when things clicked. Now that I recognise that I am orgasming I have achieved level: mind blowing on several occasions. Boosted self esteem too. |-| 
|-| co98czv || 4 || First time completing an entire video game, at the tender age of 22!

Played on casual, which made the bf laugh when I told him (goddamnit he can be annoying), but I'm still damn proud of myself. Here's to my new addiction! |-| 
|-| co9978c || 4 || First time coming out to someone. You know how people say it feels like lifted off your chest? I thought it was bs, but guess how I felt? |-| 
|-| co9auzq || 4 || Becoming a father. |-| 
|-| co9nx50 || 4 || Yesterday in Dungeons and Dragons, as the DM, I killed my first Player Character. The guy kept fighting a bunch of assassins that were sent to kill him on his own. I figured he would see the unfairness and try to get away. I gave him some Wisdom rolls to have his character realize it as well. He rolled really badly.

RIP Mato, manwhore Paladin of Sharess. |-|

|-| co93y2t || 3 || At the start if my freshman year of college, I got a shot glass that could hold 5 shots. We called it the lighthouse keeper (each shot was a different title, from tadpole, to angler, to ship captain, up to lighthouse keeper at shot #5). All of my friends had taken a lighthouse keeper before, except me. So, a couple weeks ago, I finally took a lighthouse keeper. 

Almost immediately slipped on a stair, rolled my ankle, and tore 2 ligaments. Now I get to wear a big cast for the next month.  |-|

|-| co9ae4v || 3 || I man-scaped. The resultant, lobster-red rash is still making me cry at every step. 

Help me... |-| 
|-| co9dbon || 3 || First time getting back with an ex boyfriend. I was raised to be decisive and independent, to not put up with shit, so I always thought that going back to someone made one weak-willed and frankly, stupid. I broke up with my SO a few months ago, during our long distance relationship because I was annoyed at small faults and mostly because I was unhappy with myself and didn't want human contact. Got back together when I realized it wasn't so bad to lean on someone a little and accept faults and allow my faults to be accepted.  |-| 
|-| co9m3kl || 3 || I got glasses for the first time 4 days ago. I thought I was just a tad nearsighted. Nope! Put those things on and suddenly the world was in high definition.

|-| co91l2a || 3 || First time riding a motorcycle :) |-| 
|-| co91lcz || 3 || Had two this year, one positive and one negative.

I enrolled in health insurance in January.  Actually, I enrolled in December but it didn't go into effect until January 1st and I just yesterday paid my first premium (after the initial down payment).  I felt like such a goddamn grown-up when I got my coverage card in the mail.

I broke up with my boyfriend almost a month ago.  Technically he broke up with me, but he was the one who was cheating and got found out.  We were a long-distance relationship and I came to find out that he'd been cheating on me for four months, even proposed to the other girl while making plans to move in with me in a few months.  We had been off and on since April, hadn't even met in person, and here he was visiting this other woman while telling me he "got lost" on the drive out to see me.  I felt pretty fucking awful, this guy was my first serious relationship since my husband's death.  Now I just remind myself that there are better guys out there, guys who will respect me and all of that. |-| 
|-| co91nh4 || 3 || First time exploring an abandoned building. Three of us wanted to explore an abandoned building because there was a lot of speculation as to what it was. We got through almost the whole thing before security got there and we got off completely free because we cooperated and told him we didn't break in, the door was already open and we got nosy (that part was a lie....we brought tools to get in). No cops involved and he was super nice. 

It was the most fun I'd had in a long time. |-| 
|-| co944r1 || 3 || I got butt sex from my wife for my birthday.  I'm 40. |-| 
|-| co94dky || 3 || First time getting my heart broken. Yeah... |-| 
|-| co94inh || 3 || First time driving in a car wash the other day. I made my mom come with me (I'm an 18 year old girl) because I was scared to do it by myself. I am pathetic |-| 
|-| co99vhg || 3 || I went skydiving three days ago. I've had a shit time of it lately, not getting into my university (college) course, amongst other things. It felt so good to just say fuck everything I'm jumping out of a plane  |-|

|-| co8tv3x || 224 || I hardly know my dad; him and mum split when I was 6. Growing up he was either working away or in and out of prison. Petty theft, drink driving, spousal assault (both my mother and his side-girls). The last time he was sent down, I was 14. It was for armed robbery. He got out when I was 25. 

Last summer he was diagnosed with sclerosis of the liver. The doctors told him that, without a transplant, he'd be dead before Christmas. He was lucky and the transplant came just in time. 

I visited him in the hospital a few days before his transplant came through. He knew I didn't want to be there but he also knew he was close to the end. I guess he wanted to make peace with me and my younger brother. He'd been in and out of it for days but he suddenly became very lucid; he reached out of his bed, gripped my shirt and pulled me close and, very quietly, told me: "don't end up like me".  |-| 
|-| co8ux7f || 70 || He worded it more eloquently if I recall but it was essentially:

Trust is built over the life of a relationship but can be lost in an instant if you're not careful. 

Nobody can take your integrity away from you. It's one of the few things that is yours, so be careful with it because it can be lost. 

Something like that anyhow. That's the message I received and retained so it will have to do.

After she takes her haul to their bedroom, my dad rubs his brow, turns to me and says, "Son, only women think they can save you money by *buying shit.*"

 Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.

There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man

 Don’t make decisions when you’re angry. Don’t make promises when you’re happy.

 If you blame it on someone else, don’t expect it to get better.

 If the grass is greener on the other side, there’s probably more manure there.

With regards to the opposite sex: If you look hungry, you’ll starve.

Strive to be the man you want your daughter to marry.

Never forget your car keys will change your car from one tonne of inert metal into one of the most deadly killing machines that has been invented.


Try not to take anything personally. No one thinks about you as much as you do.

 Figure out what you love to do, and then figure out how to get someone to pay you to do it.

If you treat a woman like a queen, and she treats you like a jester, your princess is in another castle.




Smart girls like to hear they’re pretty, pretty girls like to hear that they’re smart.

* When the guy you're fighting falls down the fight isn't over.  If he gets back up he's going to be *very* mad.  Start kicking him when he goes down.

Eyes wide, I said: "Then what happened?"

He said: "*I died.*"

I burst out laughing. Apparently, he'd just gotten a shock and a good lesson. After that (and after learning more about electricity) I calmed down and stopped being such a ninny. |-|

Don't date for love and marriage in college, first date to find what you're looking for in a partner. Go to the gym as often as you can. You'll look and feel better about yourself, and all the hot girls with great bodies go there all the time; that's how they get those bodies. And finally, when you need a place to dump the bodies, throw them in an enemy's car trunk and light them on fire. They'll never find your finger prints, and your enemy will at least be under scrutiny for a while, if not get outright arrested and charged for murder."

As a bonus, I learned to first press the dead bodies' fingers all over the inside of my enemies' room leaving prints everywhere, along with leaving some hair and clothes from the recently deceased in their hamper and in their bathroom too.  |-|

He was referring to my job...at the time I thought he was insulting me but I came to realise that he was talking about the pressure that is put on you by your colleagues and managers, how you are made to feel like you can't say no, can't quit, can't move jobs, because the system is so stretched that they "can't cope without you". Its a mentality that can be so entrenched in a workplace that you don't always do what is right for you, but stick things out through "obligations" to a department.  |-| 
|-| co8rpy7 || 16 || My father has given me so much advice throughout the years, I've likely forgotten more of it than I'll ever be able to fathom. Most of it was genuinely helpful and entirely well-meaning... but given that the man is something of a self-styled prankster, I would occasionally have to accept his wisdom with a grape-sized grain of salt.

There was the time, for instance, that my family spent an evening at a local Mexican restaurant. All of the employees - including the guitar player that had been hired for entertainment - were Mexican immigrants, and I decided that I wanted to interact with them in their native tongue.

"Dad," I said to my father, "how can I tell the guitar player that I like his music?"

He considered this. "Just say '*mis zapatos huelen mucho*.'"

For the record, that phrase translates roughly to "My shoes are smelly."

There's a particular facial expression that the men in my family adopt when they're telling tall tales, appropriately referred to as "The Max Face" (because many of us are named Max). Unfortunately, at the time I had yet to learn the signs for recognizing it, and I repeated my fathers words verbatim as soon as the entertainer was close enough to hear me.

"What?" the man said, giving me a confused look.

"I said," I answered with a smile, "*mis zapatos huelen mucho!*"

The guitarist glanced at my parents, perhaps hoping for an explanation, but saw only a man hiding a mischievous grin and a woman shaking her head in exasperation.

"*Mis zapatos*," I said once more, "*huelen mucho!*"

"Okay," the man replied. I happily beamed at him, then returned to my meal, thoroughly convinced that I'd made his night by making an extra effort to communicate. My father, of course, took that moment to start gleefully giggling, after which he translated the actual meaning behind the phrase.

That was only one such time that his advice turned out to be more impish than invaluable, and it was far from the last. Even so, I managed to learn something that evening... and as with nigh-on every interaction with my father, I got a story out of it.

Yeah, it's rough around the edges, but it made it easy to decide if the guy was worth the trouble. If I didn't mind someone else doing it, it wasn't that important and if he had a problem with it he could go find her.

*"If it's worth doing, it's worth doing right the first time,"* has been the most helpful advice in regards to work. My accuracy and quality of work has gotten me places mediocre stuff wouldn't have.

*"Those to whom much is given, much is expected,"* taught me to respect my talents and be a productive citizen by paying taxes without complaint, giving to charity, helping others if something is easy for me, and not accepting anything less than my best.

|-| co924ei || 3 || Sadly, my dad has never really been around to give me any kind of advice before he gave my family the finger, but when I become a dad some day I'm going to impart the following:

* Some will call you stubborn, others will call you strong, but regardless of what they say if you know deep down that what you're doing is the right and just thing, their opinions shouldn't matter.

* (Stole this from somewhere years ago) Do what is right regardless of what you're told, not what you're told regardless of what is right.

* Being strong isn't always about beating up other kids, or lifting something heavy over your head. The strongest of people know their weaknesses and do what they can to improve on them; they try to help those that can't defend themselves; they know their limits and seek help when they need it. 

* There's going to be different people of different backgrounds telling you that one viewpoint is better and truer than the other; they'll come in all shapes and sizes: religions, political views, social norms, words of hatred or kindness. Don't take things at surface value: question it. There will be slivers of real truths in them, and a lot of them will coincide with the truths that you will know, like don't cheat on your spouse, don't commit murder, do love others as you would yourself, and so on. But when the day comes where your views are challenged, don't be quick to judge. Dig into it and maybe you'll find why some people feel and think the way they do about the things they're invested in. Maybe you'll just think in the end their viewpoint is garbage anyway and you can be on your merry way, but if the opposing view has merit maybe you'll take a little of their view and add it onto your own to improve your sense of right and wrong.

* There's no quick and easy way to achieve or attain something valuable and hard-earned; anyone else who tells you otherwise is trying to sell you something. 

* Be open-minded but within reason. There's a difference between trying a new food or drink and trying meth for the first time: the former opens your mind and palette to different cultures and experiences and the latter just makes you a dumbass. 

* For god's sake kid, read! I'll give you all of my Harry Potter books, or take you to a library and check out books with you, but don't give up your drive to want to learn something new and more as much as you can. Only the smartest know just how vast everything is and how limited they are in knowing all of it.

* One of your worst enemies will be your own ego: it'll tell you that you're never wrong, that you're invincible, that you have no weaknesses and limits. Tell your ego to shut up on a regular basis. Accept the lesson when you're wrong, and train harder to spite your shortcomings.

* (Should my kid(s) ever get depressed) I know it feels like it's the end of the line; like you have nowhere else left to go and no reason to keep trying when you know in your gut that there's no point to press on anymore. I was there too; dreams shattered, hopes crushed, and nothing mattered to me other than simply wanting the pain to end. Forcing yourself to become numb to your surroundings only goes so far before it adds onto your hurt. But it's in these terrible, hopeless moments that we're faced with a very basic choice: try again or quit. I know you want to quit; you want to just say "screw it" to whatever else may be down the line, because while you know there could be many great things out there to bring you joy, none of them matter because they're not here in your life right now, and that's understandable. But if you quit now, you remove any chance of any of that ever happening. It might not happen right away, and it might not happen in the way you imagine it to be, but your happy moments are coming as fast as they can. I struggled like hell to be where I am, and sometimes I struggle even now, but if I gave up ___ years ago, I would've left nothing but heartache for everyone else, never got to find out how happy I could really be, and I would've never had you. I love you kid. |-|

You know she is the one for you, and you have been in love with her since the third date, but you still have to work hard to impress her. She invites you to a party she is having at her parents house, a great opportunity to make an impression. All of her family and friends will be there. You have to go to the bathroom. There's a super long line, (the house only has one bathroom) but you can hold it, no big deal. You get in there, and things go horribly wrong. First of all, you are wearing black leather pants, and as soon as you pull them down you instantly realize you can't get them back on. Whatever, you will deal with that in a second. You poop. It is a terrible, burning, stinky, runny ordeal. You  finish up, but realize that there is no toilet paper. In the entire bathroom. Finally, after frantically searching, you decide to suck it up and go to flush. The toilet backs up. There is no plunger in the bathroom, it reeks, and there is nothing you can do about it. Now you have to get your pants back on and deal with this. You see some baby powder, and rub that on your legs and hands to help get the pants back up (maybe it will try up the liquid or something, you had texted a friend whom wears leather pants and he suggested it) but that doesn't work. Unfortunately, it doesn't work and you now have white powder all over your hands and black leather pants. You see some lotion, and think that maybe if you rub it on your legs it will help you pull it the pants.            Unfortunately it makes a paste with the powder, and you still can't get the pants up. While trying to pull up the pants, you hand slips and the paste, which is all over you hands, gets on your shirt and face. You still can't get your pants up, the toilet is clogged and is going to stay that way, your phone dies so you can't text or call a friend for backup, and there is a long line that is getting impatient. |-|

The first night we set up camp/tents etc, didn't do too much. The next day we set out to find a couple caves. Explored a lot of old mining tunnels which were all caved in. My Uncle mentions a very small cave that was closer to us than any others. 




It's  a down-hill entrance that has a small opening. Barely enough for me to crawl through and i'm a small person. Once through I look around, it's just an opening about 25feet in diameter with a small pond/puddle in the center. I shine my light at the walls, it looks as if water has dropped in to the puddle and caused small beads all over the  inside of the cave. It's every where though, even to my left where the puddle is furthest. Hell it's even on the roof, but there's no leak. WTF? Then I realize what's happening. All those little "beads" of light, are spider-eyes catching my flash light. I have never seen anything like them, they were as big as  a playing card, but had cricket-like bodies.





Before shitting myself or  entering cardiac arrest I exit the cave as fast as humanly possible. My Uncle asks how it is, I say "Lame, but it has an interesting pond in the center you might want to check it out".  About  a minute after he wiggles through the opening (he had to clear away some dirt) he starts yelling.  Sprints out of the cave falls about 3-5 times all the while never looking back.

Everyone knows that once you go through your first child, you don't care too much about what the other one's do and I was the second child when my mom was alive. Moving into a house where I became the first child really didn't go over well. I am now 25 and we have a good relationship but it was pretty rocky when I first moved in. I only lived there for so long as I went to college not too long after, but I will say I never really felt "part of the family," or "unconditionally loved."

|-| co9etrx || 115 || I currently have custody of my godchild. She is twelve and her mother and father are unable to care for her at this time. She was also failing school and getting into tons of trouble, including running away for a few days.

Her parents transferred temporary custody via a temporary custody agreement (we literally googled that and our home state and used the form) with the clerk of courts. It was really easy, we met with a notary and then filed the forms with the county.

My goddaughter then moved several hours away with my husband and I. We immediately enrolled her in school and got her insurance switched over. She saw a doctor and got a counselor right away. With the agreement it was very easy. I just faxed a copy to whatever party required them. I had her shot records on file from her previous school so they transferred that over.

Thus far she is doing better in school, hanging out with a better crowd and she has even joined the cheer-leading squad.

Honestly, I thought it would be harder. I already have a eleven year old son so the transition from one child to two wasn't as extreme.  |-|

They were always *so* much more overprotective of me, to the point where I was suicidal for a while because I felt like nothing I did was ever right. My siblings did whatever the hell they wanted, but if I so much as went out for dinner with a friend, it was like I committed murder. I've kind of always felt like a black sheep too. |-| 
|-| co9f28f || 64 || I'm the godchild in this situation, but I suppose the story is still what you're looking for.

My godmother, whom I live with now, isn't actually a blood relative of mine. She's been a very close family friend for quite a long time, as she moved in with my grandmother when my mother was about 7 I believe. She was always a large part of her life, somewhat like a second parent especially after my grandmother passed of ovarian cancer.

As for how I ended up living with her, my mother died almost a few years ago now from breast cancer. My godmother was over helping her, my siblings and I just about every day my mother was on hospice. I'm still not sure how she missed that much work. My parents split so early in my life I don't even remember them being together, and my father was always very distant. A few holidays a year maybe, a call on the birthday, you know the deal. 

After my mother went, the obvious choice as to where to live was my godmother. I saw her probably about every other day even when my mother wasn't sick, which made me think of her as family far more than my own father. My father seemed to see this as some sort of calling or something and expected me to live with him. I was really glad he wanted to be around more, but I told him my decision and a whole custody thing came up of it. It was pretty ridiculous, I was 17 at the time so all I really had to do was fill in the judge and he went with my pick. My father called that his "line in the sand" and I haven't talked to him in over a couple years. But I guess that's kind of unrelated to the question.

As for how things have turned out, I'm still living with her until I finish community college and transfer. She's great to me, helps me out whenever I need it and I do what I can. In terms of reliability and things like that, she does fill in the role of a later-in-life parent. But the big drawback is that she just isn't and never will be "my mother". That level of closeness just isn't there. I don't really know how to describe it, but she isn't the same kind of emotional support my mother was. I just wouldn't feel right letting out all my problems with her, and I can't really remember her opening up about much to me either. But I love her, and I know she does too. I really couldn't ask her for more, she's already been unbelievably helpful to me and my mother before me. I don't know what I'd do without her.

If you're asking this because of a situation you're in, I'd say the biggest thing I'd have to say is be as close to them as possible. Be open with them, and encourage the same from them however you can. You don't need to fill in the role of their parent, but if you can give them that support and feeling of comfort, it's what they really need - especially after what they probably went through to end up with a godparent. I sure know I do. |-| 
|-| co9has6 || 27 || I am sorry this does not answer your question per se, i just need to get this off my chest.

I am a deadbeat godparent.  

My friend got pregnant when we were in our teens.  Sadly, being young and stupid, I had no idea what she was going through- becoming a mother.  

Well, she had her baby, a son, and asked if I wanted to be a god-parent.  "Well, duh, hells yeah!" I mean, it's not like anything would *ever* happen to her! 

Being that she was now a young mom, our paths began to split, I moved far away.  She got married.  I got married.  I eventually had a child of my own, she had a second child, life went on.

We kept loosely in touch.  Her relationship seemed strange- her husband wouldn't let her have many opportunities to talk or hang out when I would come to town.  She would go back and forth between telling me how poorly he treated her- and then turn around and tell me how lucky she was to have him and how he was "her knight in shining armor".

I should have seen the signs.  I should have acted. I should have *been there*. Looking back over the time we spent together, I feel like I just missed opportunities left and right.  I never got to know either of her boys.  I never pried about her marriage.  I never interfered with the abuse. 

The winter night I heard she was missing, I was miles and miles away.  I did nothing.  I didn't even come home for the funeral.  I couldn't.. But I really don't know if I would have gone had been able.  I should have at least tried.  I don't know why I let myself stay distanced.  

I kept loosely in touch with her family, but I have done very little communication to either of her boys.  I have never even brought up the godparent thing- I feel like it's the elephant in the room.  There was a huge amount of legal drama before her husband was finally convicted and the boys were finally able to stay with her mom, their grandma.  

Her family has been through so much, I don't know how anything I could say or do would begin to make a difference.  I should have been there.  I never even bothered to ask what I could do to help- never even offered to step up and be a role model.  I am ashamed, scared, embarrassed all rolled into one for not being there for her and not making any attempt to get to know the boys.  I mean where do you start?  "Hey young man, sorry about your mom!"  

There at days when I want to reach out and just start writing the older son who is now practically an adult.  I really don't even know where to begin.  And as a teenage boy, wouldn't it be kinda creepy if some lady you barely know just starts acting all interested in you and what you're up to?  Eewww.  I've just defaulted to what I do best. Nothing- well, not necessarily nothing- I'm actually quite busy- but nothing in the social aspect.  I revert to being a hermit.

I see her sister sometimes- maybe a couple times a year (coincidentally lives close).  I loosely keep in touch with her mom and try to visit when I'm in town.  I occasionally see pictures of the boys and feel so ashamed at how little I know them even though they look just like her in their own little ways.

My godmother was awesome.  She sent me a present every birthday and an ornament every Christmas.  I, on the other hand, am the lousiest excuse in the world for a godmother.  I am quite ashamed of that fact, yet obviously have done nothing to change it which makes it all the worse.
 |-| 
|-| co9ja3q || 27 || I can sort of answer this from the other perspective. My Aunt was my godmother. My parents were/are still around, so it's not like I had to live with her, but we were always fairly close. 

She made it a point to take me to church with her. She was very much a Christian, but not the annoying kind. When I was in my mid-Twenties, my parents moved overseas for a few years. I was going through a really tough time and so my aunt convinced me to come stay with them until I could get things sorted out in my life. I did and started going with her to her church. She didn't pressure me or beat me with scriptures or judgment, it was her kindness that made me want to go with Her. That one time turned into a lot of times, because the people there were super people. 

It was a Pentecostal church, but it was started in the 70's by Bikers and Hippies. They loved bluegrass and old gospel music. Honestly for a long time, the music was the only reason I kept going back. I don't particularly care for that type of music out of that context, but I loved it in that setting.

Over the years, we grew apart. The truth is, I grew up and didn't have time for her anymore. She still never judged me. She was always kind and loving. My beliefs turned pretty skeptical, but still, never a word of condemnation.

She just passed away right before Christmas after a long battle with Alzheimer's. She did her job though, because she is what god had in mind and what I hope he wants his people to be like. I will always compare Christians to her, regardless of what I may believe. Most fall short. I can't think about her without thinking about the fact that she embodied what I hope Jesus had in mind.

My niece and nephew moved in with my husband and I last year after it became too much for their mom to take care of them. Honestly, it has been tough on my marriage to go from having no kids to having a 11 and 9 year old. However I do not regret our decision to take the kids in.

My husband and I can provide a much better life for the kids than their mother can, the first of which is a abuse free home life. We try to treat the kids like our own, which having no baseline to compare it to I am not sure if we are doing it correctly or not. The kids are doing so much better with us, they are involved in sports, doing well in school, and eating much better. 

We are not sure at this point if it will be permanent but we certainly hope so.

|-| co9fycb || 19 || I'm not a godparent, but I have a story that relates to this.

There was this girl named Cassie* who I met in junior high and knew high school. We weren't really friends, but it was a pretty small town so we interacted quite a bit and had mutual friends. I'm not sure where her parents were, but she and her brother who is a couple years older were being raised by their grandmother. I know that Cassie struggled with severe depression during her teens and got into some pretty heavy drugs. She dropped out in year 11 and I moved away and didn't really have contact with her, except we were Facebook friends so I was sort of aware of the goings on in her life.

Well, she wound up having a baby when she was 19 or 20, she was single and seemed to be really trying to straighten her life out for her little boy, named Owen*. She would post about taking Owen to the library, or taking walks to the park with him, playing on the slide, etc. Intermittently she would mention her mental health situation, which wasn't good, and she really seemed very lonely, despite having her son and her brother, who was newly married to this beautiful girl, had a good job and a house and seemed very happy and well-off in comparison to his sister.

Fast forward to last year, it's been ten years since I've seen her and suddenly she calls me one night. She was in tears, clearly in the midst of a panic attack and kept profusely apologizing for some mean thing she said to me back in middle school, which I had totally forgotten about but she apparently felt intense guilt over. I knew she was depressed, and I recognized that this call out of the blue might be a sign that she was suicidal, so I talked to her for a long time, assuring her that I felt no animosity toward her over the incident when we were kids, but she just kept apologizing. I tried to keep the conversation light, asked her about her son, made plans with her to meet up for coffee that weekend, and I kept her on the phone until I felt sure that she had calmed down and sounded okay.

Two days later I learned, via Facebook, that she had died that night. Her cause of death wasn't specified, other than "peacefully in her home," but I knew what had happened.

 I see the way her brother and his wife have taken Owen in and have legally adopted him and are raising him as their own son. He's five now and calls them mom and dad (though he talks about his bio mom and is encouraged to remember her), and is being given a privileged, stable upbringing unlike anything Cassie could have provided for him in her financial and mental state. I'm pretty sure that Cassie knew that Owen would be well taken care of, I know she felt intense guilt and perhaps she thought that he'd be better off without her, and it gave her the courage to go through with her suicide. It's incredibly sad and I wish I could have helped her, but I know she would be happy to know that her baby is being so well taken care of, and she isn't forgotten. RIP, Cassie &lt;3

**Names changed to protect identities |-| 
|-| co9eupj || 12 || Does it actually work that way?  From my perspective, i.e., born and raised Catholic with heavily Catholic family, the "godparents" are those somewhat responsible and involved with the child's Christian/Catholic upbringing.  They set a good example and all that shit.  That's pretty much what the priest says during godparent's "class."  

There's no true **legal** ramification to being a godparent.  My three siblings and I all had separate godparents, but when I was old enough to inquire or be curious about such things, I knew that if both my parents died all three of us would go to my aunt and uncle (my sister's godparents).  Similarly, my sister has six kids (lol Catholicism), and while they all have different godparents, I know for a fact that the kids would go to me and my ex-wife.  Wait a second.  EX-wife.  I better make sure my sister changed it in their wills.  I can't handle six kids.    |-| 
|-| co9exxw || 4 || At least you got a couple of nice responses. |-| 
|-| co9j1gi || 5 || Godparents have no legal right to the minor.  The purpose of the godparent in the Catholic church is to ensure they're taught about the religion and keep up with their communion etc if the parents fail to do so.  It has nothing to do with custody.

That said, it's usually a family member so they do have a leg to stand on legally if they're trying to adopt. |-| 
|-| co9n4fa || 3 || I am the godchild in this scenario.  
My parents both passed away when I was a teenager and my godparents had to take over. I had never really known them my whole life, and they had never dealt with a teenager before so needless to say we were both terrified.

But they were younger than my parents were and really became good friends of mine and some of the best influences in my life. I owe them everything. Paperwork was little to none since my dad had a will, so that was easy. But they did take on the responsibility of sorting through my parent's belongings and finding paperwork and bank accounts which they still deal with to this day. I'd say the hardest part was definitely the sudden life adjustment for everybody involved. |-|

|-| co98tea || 31 || When I was in my early 30's, my best friend and his wife were murdered. Their killer attempted to kill their infant son, but had to flee. I found the associate to the murder, who used to be a friend, and tried to kill him for his crimes. I was wrongly imprisoned for 13 years until I was finally able to escape from jail. I discovered the murderer and his associate were still plotting to kill the child, so I went to his school to stop them. After a long battle, I explained to the child who I was and told him that he could live with me if he wanted. A year later, he moved in to use my house as a safe spot for a few months but due to my notoriety as an escaped murderer, I couldn't leave the house. Finally, before the child returned to my house for the summer, my cousin killed me. I never got to be the godfather he had hoped for |-| 
|-| co92bg7 || -18 || Well I first notice that the parents of a young girl were treating her terribly. Her parents would spoil their other daughters and reduce this poor child to medial physical labor.

So one night, I noticed she was particularly sad as her sisters got to go out to ball as she was left behind to do chores. Feeling Empathetic I put some psychedelic drugs in here drink(Cosby style) thinking she might enjoy a nice break from reality.

Unfortunately, I guess I gave were way to much cause she just started rambling about Pumpkin carriages and glass slippers. Poor girl.

Edit: I guess no one likes disney princesses.  |-| 
|-| co97vk0 || -17 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| co9hnt5 || -6 || Well, I was in jail when his parents died so custody went to his distant relatives, not particularly lovely people. His cousin tormented him the whole time, he had to live in a closet, it was really awful. Then, I finally got broken out of jail and got the opportunity to go see him - unfortunately, since the authorities are still after me, I couldn't keep as close an eye on him as I wanted. Then, after a brief stint with a group of rebels and revolutionaries, I got pushed into a mirror-limbo from which I can never come back. I can only imagine how hard it was on him; the same bloke who killed his parents tried to kill him, gave him a lightning shaped scar on his forehead to boot. |-|

I'd tried the whole no-contact thing to work on moving on.  ~5 months of no contact and within a week of talking to each other I felt the same way again.  She's one of my closest friends, so I don't want to cut her out of my life.

|-| co8pvh6 || 51 || I'll take a stab at this.

I've been working in Korea for the past year. I am no longer going to be doing that and it was quite sudden. I have 30 days to figure out my life again and leave the country and sell all of my possessions. 

I also need to figure out what to do next. So far my ideas have been to start my own business, take another job in my field and aggressively search, go on a trip see some of the world but without a destination I find I may not enjoy this option.

The two big questions are 

1) What should I pursue next as far as work is concerned.

2) Where should I do it?

I don't know which country to even try to live in or where to go. I'm originally from Canada but I don't have much of a desire to return there. I speak a decent amount of French and am fluent in English and my Korean is still rather poor. 

I've been in the infantry, worked as a web developer, a video producer, a video playback technician, and a teacher for my most notable jobs.

I have two forms of education a 2yr in Web Development and a B.S. in Business Management. 

My interests are video games, video work, working out and fitness. I also really enjoy learning and am often fiddling around with side projects for fun.

I want to continue this absolutely fantastic journey that life has been so far. It's time to decide a new path and I have a few ideas but nothing is sticking so far and I'm wasting the short amount of time I have to sort all of this out.

There you have it Reddit. My current dilemma. I appreciate any input.

**TL;DR - Need to leave country and figure out what to do next in 30 days. Above is information about me to help make a better judgement call but I am currently welcoming all suggestions for what to pursue next in life.** |-| 
|-| co8q8r8 || 191 || - Motivation. I can't make myself do anything. I've already listed out everything that needs to be done and made a schedule to get these things done. But i... don't do it. I get the problem, I need to force myself to do things that I don't want to do. But when I try, it doesn't happen. The result is me failing school and falling behind on life.

- I'm very depressed. I usually feel sad and worthless. But sometimes, I get I-want-to-injure-myself sad. My life is miserable. It's like having a permanent cold. Sometimes you just lay in bed because you don't have the energy to move. Other times you can still go about your life, but it's such a chore.

- My social skills are awful. So I have few friends and no close ones. I'm lonely. I want to talk about the things I find important with other people.. I understand that these skills can be learned though. But the more I've tried to learn, the more I realized that I'm really clueless and people are really complicated. I'm not sure if I could ever learn.

- I think I'm weird. I'm not trying to be a special snowflake. I've never met anyone who likes the things I like. My opinions are always unpopular and in the minority. Most people don't even look like me, which alienates me further. 

My life is nothing. It feels like if I want anything then I have to climb Mt. Everest alone in a t-shirt.

**edit:** Thanks for all the feedback. I think I'm going to try to see a psychiatrist so I can take meds. Many of you have said that it maybe could get getter. I think you're lying. ^\(sorry\) I will give meds an earnest effort.

**edit2:** If you can relate to what I wrote, 1) Know that you're not alone. I know that doesn't help a lot but you can't say you're alone any more and 2) Read the advice people gave me. Maybe it could help you. |-|

|-| co8puya || 125 || I just lost my dog (best friend) of 13 years last night. he passed in my brother's arms as we brought him into the vet due to heart failure. 
Cried from that point till when I went to sleep and began to sob again just now as I woke up because he wasn't in my room to greet me like always. 

edit 1; you guys are amazing, i cried even more reading your stories and felt the comfort. multiple times today I went to just go sit down in his favorite spots or lay next to his bed and just cry. thankfully i have 3 friends that helped me get through the 1st day of not having my beloved friend by my side in 13 years (they're probably reading this "Thank you guys"). I just feel empty and alone without my Golden Retriever, Oscar, here. |-|

|-| co8okt1 || 50 || Honestly? A combination of student debt, and being under-qualified has plagued me for years. I couldn't get enough loans to stay in school, so I didn't get to graduate. Now I can't get a job good enough to pay off the loans I already had, nor afford to return to education to further my qualifications.  |-| 
|-| co8qe9v || 24 || Making friends. Now that college has wrapped up and my life is starting to find some real rhythm I'm realizing that I have little in common with my old friends. I don't resent them or anything, it's just that we have very little interest in the same things now that we're all a little older. I understand that people move in and out of life, but I feel like I'm on an island most of the time and really wish I could make some real bonds with others around me. |-| 
|-| co8xamh || 25 || I'm not in love with my boyfriend anymore. We live together, we adopted a dog together (difficult dog, in training), we have two roommates in a house that I bought on my own. He's my best friend, and I don't really have any other local friends. I'm afraid of being alone, but I know I don't want to stay with him forever. He's 100% invested in me and gets really upset/depressed when I mention breaking up, which I have brought up a number of times. The problem is that there isn't any real problem. It's not like he does anything wrong. He doesn't make much money which is a burden on me, but that's not something to break up with someone over. It's just that I don't feel totally in love with him, I just want to be friends.

I know that people will think I'm an asshole for continuing to be in the relationship, and I honestly don't think they're wrong. It's just that I don't really mind it, I do enjoy everything about him, but not romantically/sexually. Also I have several times made a serious effort to break it off, but he does everything in his power to keep that from happening. Again, I know that doesn't excuse me, but it really is difficult to break up with someone who won't let you. |-|

|-| co8q3vk || 17 || After a year of being broken up my ex told me she's sorry for everything that happened, regrets hurting me, and still loves me. She is stationed a few states over from me, and said she wants me to come get her later this month for a 4 day weekend. Also said she wants me to come live with her before she gets deployed to Jordan next year. I am deeply in love with her and this was the best thing I've heard since we were together. The problem is that after we got off the phone I haven't heard from her. That was Thursday and now it's Monday. I feel like I've been lied to and hurt all over again for believing she was actually sorry and meant what she was saying. I feel tricked and stupid and like I lost her all over again. This was the first time we had really talked about our feelings for each other since the breakup last year.  |-| 
|-| co8redl || 16 || My dad left me and my siblings an apartment. When he died that apartment was sold and money was given to my brother. He then used all the money towards his marriage including my share of 10K. I have asked plenty times for it and no one gives me a straight answer for it. When I owed them money(2K to make a college payment), the whole family got together sat me down to figure out how can I return the money back. Yet no one ever stood up for me in my family.

Back story: I do have a student that my mom cosigned and I am in default on it so my brother says when I pay the loan off he will give me the 10K. |-|

When I'm nervus about a class, I speak with the prof to see if they have any tips or tricks to keep in mind, and they're usually more than happy to help. Except this Tolkein prof. He said if I'm intimidated or inexperienced, I shouldn't be in this class and go elsewhere. When I tried to explain I'm a writing major, he cut me off and said "I don't care, I'm not changing the curriculum for you, or anyone else," as if I would even ask!

She pulled me out of depression when we started being friends, and she's mainly the reason I didn't commit suicide in high school, so it feels awful knowing I fucked it up. To clarify, I wasn't being her friend just to ask her out, the feelings developed maybe a year after we became friends, and I would've been perfectly happy if she wanted to just stay friends, but we'd recently had a conversation about this exact thing, and she said she'd rather people be honest about it, so I thought I had nothing to lose. Now I'm slipping back into the depression she got me out of, because I don't feel like I have any support anymore... |-|

As well as his moods sometimes (he's clean almost a whole month!)Plus starting to try to save for my last yr of EDC vegas with my international friends. All this after moving to a new city last spring, moving 2 times within the new city (long stories) and picking up these jobs that do not afford me the same income as Bartending did. 

So grateful I'm able to keep my head above water but it's stressful!

|-| co8rdbj || 4 || I applied to law schools and got into a few. Full ride at T2 and acceptances at some mid T1s (working on the aid part now). I was ridiculously stressed while studying for the LSAT last year and when I retook it there was a tragic event the night before the test that prevented me from doing better. 

I feel like I can improve, that I have a chance at a top school, but it would mean studying again for June LSAT and going to school next year. I do not like my job and the office I work in will likely be closing in the winter. I would be in school, so it doesn't matter, but if I try to wait until next year, I'll be out of a job for the whole year.

I am thinking that I'll put down some deposits and take the June test regardless and see what happens.

I just graduated university and am now looking for a job.

By fourth year I could write 5 pages and have no clue what I wrote about the next day.  I was accused of cheating because I couldn't remember handing papers in, and had to start using the access center for exams.

I live at home with my family rent free, and my social life has died down so I'm not going out for the forseeable future. have no payments aside from 1 school payment or car insurance. I'm not in that bad of shape, I just really need a job lol |-| 
|-| co8qyg6 || 3 || In all honesty, there is an odd situation I'm dealing with at the current moment. So have any of you felt a connection so strong, (not romantic) just a connection with another person that was unexplainable? This is what I'm dealing with. Here is the story. 

In high school (which I'm a current senior in.) I transferred my sophomore year to an all girls school sure I had some regular friends. But there was this one girl....we will call her Q. Q and I sat alone at lunch together and would talk about deep stuff in our lives. She was curious about me and I her. (JUST TO CLARIFY: I am completely straight this is a completely platonic friendship relationship.) But then at the time my depression was really bad, and I was sent to the day program at a local hospital for about a week. Then I transferred back to my old school for certain reasons. I never really got to say goodbye to Q. But I work at a local fitness center as a receptionist. I was almost at the point where I forgot about Q. But then her and her family came to work out. 

This whole situation is surreal in a way. I don't know what to do. I still keep in contact with some other friends at the all girls school, and I asked someone for her number or imessage. Got an imessage, I sent her something she has yet to respond. It's just an odd situation. I miss her. She actually cared. This is too long and hard to explain....

TL;DR Met a girl at my old school have a deep connection that is really hard to explain...:\ |-|

However, I'm not sure we'll be ready by then. You see, the drama club already performed this play in the fall, but about half of the people who participated in the fall weren't able to do it for the festival because they were too busy with sports, work, or other various commitments. Luckily, some freshmen decided that they wanted to join and we were able to recast those parts. Seems like a perfect solution, right? Not really. Most of these kids have never acted before, which I wouldn't usually hold against them because I'm all for people trying new things, but in this case, we have less than a month until the festival and almost nobody knows their lines, we've had three snow days, (two of which were on days when we were supposed to have rehearsal) and we have to try to pull a play together with a bunch of inexperienced actors and a director who consistently makes bad decisions and plays favorites. Anyway, I don't really have a question or expect anybody to solve my problems. I just needed to vent. 

TL;DR: Drama club is trying to put on a play for a competition, but we're facing a myriad of problems.  |-| 
|-| co8oyp6 || 6 || School yo. Failing three quarters of my classes. |-| 
|-| co8zyaq || 3 || I'm too afraid to talk to anyone in my life about my depression problem. |-| 
|-| co9gqr6 || 3 || Throwaway, because school friends.

I'm 16, and am just now realizing the full consequences of potentially having Huntington's disease. My mother passed away from it when I was six, and now my uncle is beginning to degenerate. I haven't been able to sleep well, and I get nervous and depressed every time the idea crosses my mind. I don't know how I'm going to be able to deal with not knowing while I watch the symptoms overtake my uncle over the next 2 years. |-| 
|-| co8qshu || 5 || Battling an extreme urge to crossdress and have sex with a man. |-| 
|-| co8phs3 || 3 || I Kinda hate myself or i don't :/ I'm fucking confuse.  |-| 
|-| co8pq92 || 3 || My room mate/best friend does not approve of my current relationship. It's with his little sister. |-| 
|-| co8sbg2 || 3 || I can't find a job. I don't have a degree, so obviously I'm not applying to those, and I'm trying find something other than retail or food service. There's just really not anything out there |-| 
|-| co8pakh || 4 || The fact I haven't had sex in over 3 months.  |-| 
|-| co97ytm || 257 || Someone who celebrates their own ignorance |-| 
|-| co923lq || 916 || Someone who can't just chill and needs to go out every god damn night.  |-| 
|-| co984ro || 116 || Playing the no contact game. If we've been dating less than six months and I didn't run over your grandma or something there is NO winning scenario for this relationship that involves stopping contact.

Whether you're pissed at me, wanting to play some power game, testing how interested I am... I'm not putting up with it. You're more work than you're worth. |-| 
|-| co90r1z || 426 || lip to gum ratio |-| 
|-| co95hft || 366 || When a guy says "You're just so cute when you're angry" or "I love to annoy you". Lived through one sadistic relationship where he was constantly making mean remarks and then playing them off as jokes.  |-| 
|-| co92dm5 || 119 || Giving me ultimatums over the most inane things. |-| 
|-| co9442u || 218 || Not liking animals or music. 

I'm not saying you have to be a pet owner or like every animal. And you don't have to be a musician, fanatic, or even have good taste. I just think it's super fucking weird to completely dislike either and it would make me question if you were an alien.  |-| 
|-| co9cos1 || 43 || Double standards.
"You can't do this, but I'm going to do exactly that thing I just told you that you can't do." |-| 
|-| co94vrr || 313 || It has come to my attention that there are people in the world who don't really believe in closing drawers/cabinets when they're done using them. You walk into their kitchen and there are just random drawers and cupboards open all willy nilly.

I mean this in all seriousness: I could meet my soulmate (if my current spouse died in a tragic space mining accident, obviously) and if they did that shit, I would tearfully end it.

Edit: it has also come to my attention that there are people who believe everyone only has ONE soulmate, and my plans to move on after my spouse's tragic space mining accident (after a respectable mourning period, of course) suggest that my heart is not true. WHY YOU NO WANT ME TO BE HAPPY. SPACE MINING IS VERY DANGEROUS AND I DON'T WANT TO LIVE ALONE FOREVER. I need someone to listen to my hilarious criticisms of TV commercials! Just not someone who leaves cupboards open. That's a deal breaker. |-| 
|-| co90vxk || 39 || Impatience. |-| 
|-| co99qid || 33 || Having the same name as my mom. |-| 
|-| co93m14 || 121 || Cell phones when I take them out for a meal. |-| 
|-| co913r3 || 352 || when we finally meet in person and it turns out the whole time she has just been a dog with a laptop |-| 
|-| co91v24 || 178 || Lying.

I hate liars.

If you lie I will find out, and I will question you until you slip up. |-| 
|-| co97v3v || 121 || If they forget the Alamo. |-| 
|-| co90stp || 392 || To me this isn't a small thing, but I feel it's not a big deal to a lot of other people.
Smoking. I can't stand the smell of it, and it sticks to people for ages.
If I was interested in someone and I found out that they smoke, my interest would just go up on flames. |-| 
|-| co91irs || 185 || Pooping in the bed. I won't sleep with someone who poops in the bed. |-| 
|-| co96zgv || 42 || Heavy snoring. My brain is instantly set on fire to that sound. Millions of pissed off ants made up of pure rage crawl into any available space in my head. I wish I wasn't like this, but fuck..
 |-| 
|-| co91dpc || 171 || If they don't like books. I don't care what else the person does in life or even what kinds of books he reads. It could be comics or it could be door-stopper russian literature that I don't get. as long as he enjoys the written word in some form I am good. I can't imagine myself with someone who doesn't read.  |-| 
|-| co91c5x || 187 || Writing "would of." |-| 
|-| co94t82 || 243 || Being rude to waiters. As someone who feels the need to clean up the table and stack the plates before leaving a restaurant, this will definitely not fly with me.  |-| 
|-| co92b6u || 83 || An SO who doesn't allow me to do the most trivial things, like hang out with friends and go drinking with them.  

It's not just controlling, it's a huge red flag about how insecure and distrusting they are.  

I give them the benefit of the doubt by talking to them about it and telling them how I feel, but if they continue, I leave them. |-| 
|-| co981ct || 31 || Food smacking... like chewing with your mouth open and making your food smack.  |-| 
|-| co92cu5 || 49 || Not liking dogs.  |-| 
|-| co92oul || 129 || Liking country music and nothing else |-| 
|-| co90the || 46 || Do they kiss with tongue and if they do it's all about how much tongue.  |-| 
|-| co9798i || 12 || Lack of intelligence |-| 
|-| co9867z || 23 || Not liking my dog, if it's him or the dog I'll choose my dog every time. |-| 
|-| co9e1hx || 12 || If the person chews with their mouth open.  Once food is in your mouth I should not have to see or hear it again. |-| 
|-| co92jk5 || 104 || If they have more than 4 objects of Disney paraphernalia in their room. 
  |-| 
|-| co949wo || 46 || If they're racist. |-| 
|-| co94zfm || 50 || If they don't like LOTR. |-| 
|-| co92saf || 197 || One thing that has recently, on more than one occasion, been a deal-breaker for me is naturopathy/homeopathy.

If she's a vaccine denier, or recommends some kind of tea/fruit in lieu of actual medicine...I usually fall out of love pretty quick.

I just can't imagine an entire life having to fight her on "science." |-| 
|-| co90mrq || 37 || If she breaks deals. |-| 
|-| co91wbz || 121 || Someone who hates cats. Love me, love my four-legged friends. Even when they sing the song of their people at 5am and vomit on the carpet. |-| 
|-| co95qz1 || 58 || If they dont worship the all mighty lord of darkness Cthulu I tend to lose interest.  |-| 
|-| co927zx || 65 || If her penis is bigger than mine. |-| 
|-| co9197m || 26 || If my dog doesn't like her. |-| 
|-| co95s0j || 17 || Being overly dramatic or emotional.. Life's too short to be in a heightened state of stress all the time. |-| 
|-| co96bu9 || 14 || racist, bad kisser, sense of entitlement |-| 
|-| co97u5u || 7 || enjoys only one type of music |-| 
|-| co9fmyn || 8 || If he uses snuff/chewing tobacco. That fucking STINKS and looks disgusting too, especially if he's the kind that carries around a 20 oz bottle of spit.  |-| 
|-| co94sd4 || 29 || If you don't like animals. My pets are a huge part of my life and if you don't find them adorable, it's just not gonna work.  |-| 
|-| co94m6n || 51 || Being a picky eater.  |-| 
|-| co915d1 || 65 || He didnt like the Muppets.  Had to break it off. |-| 
|-| co97kti || 31 || Taste in TV.

If we are going to spend a lot of time watching TV together, I'm not watching ITV and all the shitty soaps and reality shows presented by Ant and Fucking Dec. And I don't want her rolling her eyes when I want to watch QI or Have I Got News For You. |-| 
|-| co9164z || 40 || If she's got the stank. |-| 
|-| co98q3b || 8 || Lying, either by commission or omission. |-| 
|-| co9g0em || 7 || If they are poly-amorous. 

I'm in a good relationship now, but when single I kept attracting these people. They all kept trying to reason with me on why I shouldn't care.  The last date I was on before I ended up with my SO, the person didn't even tell me they had a girlfriend until I was about to meet up with them for our first date. It feels so crummy when you start thinking you're not good enough to be in a monogamous relationship  :[ |-| 
|-| co95u3r || 46 || That thing where they have to pull out their phone or whatever to fact check anything I say, especially if I express a smidgen of doubt. |-| 
|-| co94mnz || 92 || I honestly would not be willing to have a relationship with a religious person. Every one has the right to religion but I don't want it in my life and definitely not as intimately as that.  |-| 
|-| co91eqw || 113 || if she only has guy friends  |-| 
|-| co9467u || 6 || being in a cult would probably be a deal breaker. |-| 
|-| co9eiin || 18 || This might make me unpopular but stoner behaviour.

I understand the once in awhile at a party thing, but I can't deal with a guy who smokes weed even semi regularly. I can't stand the smell for one thing and I've never dated a guy who was into weed who didn't try to pressure me into smoking with him (most of them just can't comprehend why someone wouldn't be into smoking weed). |-| 
|-| co922j7 || 17 || Speak incorrectly.  
It annoys me A LOT.  
PS: I'm brazilian, and Portuguese can be VERY tricky.  |-| 
|-| co96v5g || 11 || Chicks that lie, period. |-| 
|-| co976nt || 18 || Lack of ambition. I don't care a ton about what the ambition is for; but I just find it very attractive. 

Desire for tons of piercings/tats. 

Not being able to have meaningful discussions on current events. |-| 
|-| co98iqj || 5 || Selfishness.  |-| 
|-| co9hb0x || 5 || This has not actually come up, but I would instantly dump someone who didn't use their turn signals. |-| 
|-| co9itn8 || 5 || Addiction. I dated a recovering heroin addict once. I knew him in high school and had a brief fling with him then, and then he started using and we lost contact for a few years. I ran into him again and decided to give him a second chance. MISTAKE.

He had simply replaced heroin with alcohol. He would fall asleep in public because he'd get so drunk, and then when I'd try to wake him up to take him home he would scream at me and throw massive tantrums. 

The relationship ended when he just decided to stop speaking to me and blocked me on Facebook. The last thing he said to me before that was "I love you."

Man, I'm glad I have better self esteem now. |-| 
|-| co92sul || 20 || Tattoo to tooth ratio |-| 
|-| co91wqx || 15 || Toes. Can't date a girl with messed up toes. |-| 
|-| co96afy || 26 || If they have or want kids.  That is a no go for me.  I have absolutely zero interest in dealing with any children. That is an instant deal breaker for me.  |-| 
|-| co91tuq || 32 || Really hateful attitudes. 

I mean i can handle the occasional grumpiness and getting annoyed at people, but if she's racist/sexist/homophibic/whatever then nope, she's gone. |-| 
|-| co989py || 11 || ~~The absolute pettiest thing I can think of is if they don't like a single one of the TV shows or music artists I like. Because I really love a wide range of music and I like watching TV or listening to music when it's shitty outside (as it often is in the Midwest) and I don't want to be stuck with someone who's gonna listen to music I can't stand or TV shows I hate. We have to have SOME common ground there.~~

Scratch this I thought of something worse. I couldn't date someone with a micropenis or anyone with a lisp. Sorry people with lisps it hurts my ears. And a micro dick is just... I can't. I could deal with a smaller than average dick but not a teeny tiny one. I'm sorry.  |-| 
|-| co91c3q || 50 || Smoking:  I don't think I would put up with a girl that smelled like an ashtray.

Vegetarian:  I dated a vegan in my early 20's.  The realities pissed me off enough that I don't think I could put up with someone that had vastly different eating habits. |-| 
|-| co98c2f || 5 || If they're not open minded and willing to step out of their comfort zone a bit every so often. I don't think I can take doing the same things day-in day-out. |-| 
|-| co9ixa4 || 5 || If i go on a date and they insist on gluten free food and they are not gluten intolerant. |-| 
|-| co9mvr2 || 4 || Walking ahead of me when we are walking together. I'm short and have arthritis in my back, I'm doing the best I can. Be respectful and at least try and stay with me.  |-| 
|-| co927e7 || 13 || if you take everything serious then we can't talk anymore |-| 
|-| co942b2 || 31 || Fat. 

Typical, I know...but yeah. "No fat chicks". 

I'm fit... I like my ladies thin and femme. |-| 
|-| co9119d || 47 || Treating waitstaff rudely. |-| 
|-| co939ow || 12 || *A liar* -- even if relatively minor lies.

If you can't trust a person in small things, you can't trust them with larger things, either. |-| 
|-| co90xp9 || 36 || Smoking |-| 
|-| co95kso || 11 || "Minding" me. My ex used to take my sunglasses off of my shirt-v neck and put them in her purse, scowling "You'll ruin your shirt that way!" Fuck you. If I "ruin" my shirt (in ten years) I'll buy another fucking shirt. I make the money, you don't have a job. Little things like that. Of course, any comment I make about her is grounds for divorce. Which is why we are... |-| 
|-| co92ltx || 7 || Man hands |-| 
|-| co97mgm || 21 || -If she sleeps with her pets.  I am an animal lover, but I cannot sleep with an animal in the bed or even in a bed that had fur all over it.

-Her having an over-the-top celebrity crush.  I don't want to date a teeny bopper.

|-| co945hu || 7 || Did you say [lip to gum?](http://i.imgur.com/K7FtAKF.gif) |-| 
|-| co940iz || 7 || If they're ugly. |-| 
|-| co90oan || 11 || A penis |-| 
|-| co94cqw || 3 || Sports Team Affiliations (which teams you root for).

It's okay if you aren't into the same teams as me; it may be okay if you are into a rival team to one I love.

BUT some people just can't be cool about it, and it makes them hard to be in a relationship with.

My long ago example is that I am diehard for Bay Area teams (Sharks, Niners, Giants, Warriors), and this one young lady way back when in my single days was a diehard for St. Louis teams.  That wasn't inherently a problem, but her Cardinals fandomship was so grating and irritating, there was no way we could be a long term serious thing.  There was no way she could be playful about our respective sports loyalties.

It's just sports, who cares, right?  But it (can) matter.  If I was single again, I'd move back to the Bay immediately and only date women who are Sharks fans and Sharks are their favorite team (as compared to teams of other sports, i.e. Sharks first, Niners second, Giants third, Warriors fourth)  Misery loves company. :) |-| 
|-| co9ak3s || 3 || Someone who doesn't like animals.  |-| 
|-| co9cgiv || 3 || Someone whose never comfortable just being around together. Gotta always be doing something. We can't just settle down somewhere comfortable and relax.  |-| 
|-| co9d22q || 4 || If they hate metal or cats.  |-| 
|-| co9f4ey || 3 || if they eat with their mouth open.  |-| 
|-| co9g9xt || 3 || If they ever use the term 'big pharma' in anything but a joking manner, I just can't fuck with that person anymore. |-| 
|-| co9i318 || 3 || Ask me why I don't have an Asian accent... then ask me to do an Asian accent.  |-| 
|-| co9iu04 || 3 || Girls that use the crying laughing face emoji for everything. |-| 
|-| co9j8r4 || 3 || Littering. |-| 
|-| co9jt3u || 3 || If she calls me "daddy", I'm out. Shit's creepy. |-| 
|-| co9k1gr || 3 || Thin lips. As a full-lipped dude, I've never had a halfway decent make-out session with a thin-lipped girl. It's all tongue and teeth with those ones.  |-| 
|-| co9mrhm || 3 || Had sex with one of my close friends or family. Noooooope.  |-| 
|-| co9mrrl || 3 || If they couldn't' accept my disabilities, it be bye bye. |-| 
|-| co9n9e6 || 3 || their/there/they're

Deal breaker.  Straight up. |-| 
|-| co9ofz7 || 3 || Someone whose political affiliation is central to their identity. I don't want you dragging politics into everything. If your entire life and existence revolves around being a democrat or a republican, I'm not interested. |-| 
|-| co9b4w3 || 9 || This may sound shallow but. Being religious. Sucks I'll live in a religious town. Forever alone.  |-| 
|-| co9hvo7 || 7 || Not being able to make up your damn mind on where you want to go out to eat. 

"Hey, where do you want to eat?"

"Anywhere is good!"

"Chipotle?" "No"

"Red Lobster?" "No"

"Subway?" "No"

"The Royal Palace?" "No"..

I'M TAKING YOUR ASS TO MCDONALDS GOD DAMN IT. |-| 
|-| co9k5m9 || 5 || If she yells at her parents or family members, nothing is more of a red flag or unattractive. |-| 
|-| co914se || 30 || Probably letting themselves go. I won't deal with someone who gets fat and comfortable in a relationship. |-| 
|-| co941n0 || 7 || big nipples, the kind that cover more of the boob than there is a boob. |-| 
|-| co922n9 || 4 || beware of crazy... and bad teeth. |-| 
|-| co90qx2 || 5 || Small things?  I'd like to think small things I could live with, but maybe if there were a BUNCH of little things...they would add up and be a deal-breaker.

Smallest thing I can think of that would be a deal breaker is if they are immature and/or have a potty-humor sense of humor. |-| 
|-| co9269t || 6 || Having a Y chromosome.  |-| 
|-| co950vm || 5 || If she mocks pro-wrestling.  It's not that I care if she likes it or not, to each their own. But it's a sign that she can't respect my interests.  |-| 
|-| co931uj || 6 || Bad teeth  |-| 
|-| co9alg0 || 3 || its not ALWAYS a deal breaker, but its close enough. if you don't drink, the inability to go have a few seltzers or iced teas or whatever at the bar (barring being an alcoholic who gets anxious or tempted to drink when being at a bar, that I can totally understand). sometimes I like to go to the bar. that's where my friends are. and I'd like for you to all get along. |-| 
|-| co9dadf || 3 || Being a pothead. Just can't date someone who is like that.  |-| 
|-| co9dv6m || 3 || Bitch does crossfit, I am not taking care of her when she becomes handicapped doing something moronic. |-| 
|-| co9er8b || 3 || Trash covering floor of car.

Basically it means you're comfortable being surrounded by trash... which means I'll be constantly cleaning up your trash if we ever moved in together.

I'm not your maid, bitch. |-| 
|-| co9eteq || 3 || Calling/texting/messaging me way too much, particularly early in a relationship.

If you need to have a four hour phone conversation with me every single day and feel neglected if you don't get that attention, I'm probably not the right person for you to date. |-| 
|-| co9h65j || 3 || Someone who always needs me to come to them. 

I was seeing a guy who refused to come see me, meaning I always had to take the bus an hour one way to see him. When I asked him to come over, he snorted and said "I'm not going all the way over there!" Soon after, I said the same thing.  |-| 
|-| co9htfn || 3 || When a dude makes jokes about women belonging in the kitchen or staying at home all the time because that's what they do best.  |-| 
|-| co9leyw || 3 || That the guy who spends way more time with his friends then me. i know this seems selfish but i have been in a relationship where he only meets me once a week because he is in the army and that one day we meet is always been with his friends. im clingy as fuck because of this. lmao  |-| 
|-| co93kue || 5 || A "small thing". |-| 
|-| co9ghvt || 4 || Never shaving the nether regions. 

I can't stand pubes! Trimmed is ok, a little sexy, but if it's long enough to grip with the entirety of my fingers instead of only the tips, it's too long.  |-| 
|-| co9dhpf || 3 || Bickering. I don't want to be with someone who I bicker with all of the time. That seems to work for some couples which is fine, but not for me. I like being with someone I can be friends with as well and even if we don't share all of the same likes and dislikes we have to at least be able to converse like friends and not bicker about every little thing. |-| 
|-| co9i3du || 3 || When I give her backrubs every night without her having to ask, but she down right refuses to give me one, when I ask for it.. fuck that shit, a back needs rubbing. |-| 
|-| co9iphs || 3 || Vegan/veggie. I'm a butcher, so I just don't see how it could work out.  |-| 
|-| co92w1u || 10 || If she doesn't believe in vaccination, works for Comcast or doesn't enjoy Bill Murray movies. I know I'll get down voted to oblivion for saying that but its the truth. |-| 
|-| co9du26 || 4 || Depression.

I'm currently in a relationship with a girl that's going through depression. I love her dearly, and I do my best for her, however if this relationship goes south, I'm never again dating someone going through depression.

It's just frustrating giving 100%, and end up receiving complains about it. You don't need to reward me, but please, don't take your frustration on me, I'm human too, and it's unbearable to be treated as sub-human by someone you care so much.

Maybe I should have written this on a throw-away. Maybe not. |-| 
|-| co92mh6 || 4 || If she hated the Beatles. They are my favorite band and couldn't handle the negativity. Or a girl who judges music harshly and isn't open-minded to music.  |-| 
|-| co97ve6 || 3 || Smoking.  |-| 
|-| co9fxf5 || 3 || Likewise to the people saying those that don't tolerate their cats won't be tolerated, I don't want to date cat people at all. If I have to be woken up in the middle of the night, spend money on medical bills, deal with my stuff getting wrecked, clean up shit and puke- I might as well just get a kid that will eventually grow out of it. I don't even like going to people's houses that have cats because I always leave covered in hair. Fuck cats, fuck that they are so popular now, fuck people that let a wild animal shit in a box then sit on their counter. |-| 
|-| co90or8 || 5 || /u/PineappleInTheMist and /u/ObeseSkipper are too picky. I just request that she not be stupid. I seriously don't think I could date a dumb person.  |-| 
|-| co98918 || 5 || Smoking.

Anti-vaxxing.

Creationist. |-| 
|-| co92cen || 3 || I dated a girl who admitted to having two threesomes with four different guys. I wasn't attracted to her after that. |-| 
|-| co92dqd || 3 || Smoking.  I don't care if it is pot or tabacco. |-| 
|-| co961wb || 3 || Snoring... I like a peaceful sleep! |-| 
|-| co9bjja || 3 || Misogyny. You don't have to be a self identified straight male feminist, but your actions speak louder than words. If you feel the need to compliment me by putting other members of my gender down, then it's a deal breaker. If you babble on about how you aren't sexist, yet fail to recognize and respect women that don't hold traditional values, then adios to you.  |-| 
|-| co95txf || 3 || Fibromyalgia  |-| 
|-| co9awgv || 3 || A bad reputation. I have followed my feelings and ignored my friends advice once and ended up in the worst relationship I ever experienced. 

Some people deserve a second chance, and someone else can give it, I ain't risking it again.  |-| 
|-| co90mzu || 3 || If she's actually a dude |-| 
|-| co91zgq || -5 || Irredeemable Republicans. I truly believe that every Republican is ignorant, stupid, hopelessly brainwashed, or rich and selfish. |-| 
|-| co9cjhq || -4 || Girls who fart and think it's cute. Excuse yourself and go to the bathroom you fucking pig. |-| 
|-| co97tuv || -4 || Thinking it's okay to go out with someone of the opposite sex without me. |-| 
|-| co934ds || -6 || Farting. If you think it's just ok to fart on your SO or ANYONE for that matter, my dick goes limp in a millisecond. It's not fucking funny, it's gross. Accidental farts? Fine. Farting with the intent of humor? I don't even want to be friends with you. |-| 
|-| co92gai || -5 || Kids? No thanks. 

Smoke? No thanks. 

Drink alcohol? No thanks. 

Not intelligent? No thanks.

|-| co9dwuu || 335 || When me and my dad moved into an apartment when I was 8, I found a ventriloquist dummy hanging in the closet (like, with a string tied around its neck as if it had been hanged in the gallows), and a swastika drawn on its forehead. 

That was pretty creepy.  |-| 
|-| co9dznn || 620 || When I moved out of my last house, I left a small note inside one of the light fittings. When the bulb runs out and they are forced to replace it, the note would fall from the fixture. The note read "If your socks go missing, do not search the crawl space. It lives there..." |-| 
|-| co9gekd || 219 || Buy 10 of the same clown dolls and hide them all around your house.  When they find the first one they will thinks its pretty creepy, but when they keep finding them around the house.  They will think that the doll keeps coming back no matter how hard they try and get rid of it. |-| 
|-| co9fkfs || 201 || Get a furby, put brand new batteries it, and hide it in the wall.  |-| 
|-| co9eq73 || 427 || A single bottle of unopened Amontillado, right next to a noticeably newer section of wall in your basement. |-| 
|-| co9kcli || 169 || Step 1: Buy rain-X (you know, that stuff you put on your windshield that repels water and helps you see in the rain).

Step 2: Dip a cotton ball in the rain-X and then use it to write a scary message on the bathroom mirror. Something along the lines of "GET OUT"

When the window is dry, the rain-X will be invisible. However, the first time that they take a hot, steamy shower, the whole mirror will fog up, except where you touched with the cotton ball. So when they get out of the shower, it will look like somebody just wrote the message with their finger on the foggy mirror.  |-| 
|-| co9fvim || 74 || Dude.  I haven't even thought about this since I was 16.  

The *lovely* prior owners of my parents house had half renovated their garage.  It was a cute little old husband and wife moving to a retirement home, and they had just stopped whatever they were working on and sold it to my parents as is.

A week after the house closed we got all of these condolence letters to the wife.  Apparently the husband died the day after he sold the house to us, and the wife never sent a change of address to anyone.

While we were dismantling the garage (to turn it into my room) we came across a wall with "daddy's wall" written in chalk.  Over and over and over.  Floor to ceiling.

One week we got a few more condolence letters, but one was a dark grey envelope and it had written in what must've been a white out pen "daddy" in the same scribbled handwriting on the back.  Unlike all of the other letters, the widow's name was not on the front of the letter, it was just addressed with no name.

We did not open any of them, but were never able to get the new address, even from the realtor.

I don't want to find out what that was all about.  We all figured that family secrets should stay secrets.

Daddy's wall even without the letter was freaky as shit. |-| 
|-| co9a3o7 || 316 || We replaced the carpet in our house before we moved. I sooo wanted to draw satanic ritual symbols on the floor that would be discovered years later.  My wife wouldn't let me. |-| 
|-| co9deu6 || 97 || Yourself. Either dead or alive. Bonus points if you try to be inconspicuous about it. Maybe give the crawlspace a go or something. |-| 
|-| co9dile || 47 || I've left a child sized mannequin jammed into the deep corner of a closet. It was painted white to blend in with the wall so it was easy to miss until the closet light was turned on. 


I like to think the new tenant thought it was 3spooky.  |-| 
|-| co9bzdb || 159 || My daughter's bloody jumper/bouncy thing. That thing freaked some people out.

Anyways backstory, so my daughter was about 7 or 8 months and she had two of these exersaucer things. It's just a seat that spins with toys around it and bounces she had another one but the bottom was like a trampoline. The trampoline one was much quieter so I kept it in my room and the bigger loud one in the kitchen. One night my brother gets shit-faced drunk. Oh, now would be a good time to add that my daughter was safely in her crib sleeping, no babies were harmed in this story. Anyways, he drops a glass and it shatters, then the drunk idiot falls on the shattered glass trying to pick it up. He cuts himself all to shit and is bleeding everywhere, he decides to use the bouncy to help himself up. He doesn't make it up and ends up passing out draped over the bouncy. The commotion didn't wake me up but my daughter wanting her midnight bottle damn sure did. So, I find a bloody glass mess and drunk brother all over the kitchen. After the mess is cleaned we decide the bouncy is trash. It's just covered in blood, we hosed it off but it wasn't salvageable. We threw it out back and waited for "big trash day" then put it out at the curb with the rest of the trash. People always take crap that we put out, junkers and stuff usually take the metal. They drag shit out in the road and make a huge mess. One night I see this van pull up they hop out and take the bouncy, then not 5 minutes later pull back around and throw it back in the pile. I thought it was kind of funny until police show up the next day. Then it hits me, of course they'd  call the cops! It was a bloody baby toy! I explained everything and they see my daughter doesn't have a scratch and my idiot brother is still all cut up, they didn't even call social services. 

If it freaked people digging in the trash (find some weird shit in there) out enough to call the police, imagine finding it in the basement or shed of your new house? That'd be pretty fucked up. |-| 
|-| co9cgcg || 74 || My sister had a crude sort of child's drawing inside the back of the fireplace of her old house. It was creepy as fuck. A few years ago I had to pull out one of the kitchen cabinets and I recreated the drawing on the wall before I put the cabinet back. It's my gift to the future. |-| 
|-| co9ebtn || 96 || I dunno about creepy, but I remember when my family and I moved (just last September), my little sister left an unflushed shit in the toilet, so... *shrug* |-| 
|-| co9e5sb || 62 || an old doll from the 30's that is still sitting in my attic staring at the entrance. it has been sitting there ever since the 40's... and the worst part is that my family told me to never go into the attic. |-| 
|-| co9ha8j || 31 || In the attic, leave a picture of someone sitting facing away from the camera in the same attic. |-| 
|-| co9e81m || 30 || As we update our house we routinely find things left behind. This mostly involves religious stuff: a jar marked holy water, statuary, crosses, prayer cards. We've also found letters and photos that slipped between a shelf and the wall, or into a crack in the fireplace mantle.

So we've discussed putting things back INTO the walls. My favorite suggestion so far is a complete set of my little pony toys, preferably painted with disturbing sigils and symbols. |-| 
|-| co9ggir || 52 || Alright, this is what you do:

This works best if you live in a house near the woods, but there is a bit of flexibility here.  A rock outcropping, an overgrown field or a body of water (preferably a river or stream) are also possible.  If you live in one of those tightly packed neighborhoods with houses on all sides though you're probably SOL.  Sorry.

First, you go to the pet store and get two cow's feet (in case you don't know, butchers will literally chop cows' feet off, dry them out and sell them as dog chews).  Only get two.  This is important.

Next, attach them to a pair of stilts.  This requires a bit of DIY finesse but shouldn't be too hard.

Next, wait for a heavy rainfall.  You want the ground good and muddy for what comes next.

After the rainfall, find a roundabout way into the woods or other environment behind your house.  You don't want visible footprints from you leading away from the house, especially towards the woods.

Once in the woods, strap the stilts on and walk to the house.  Hopefully the ground will be muddy enough to leave deep footprints and the extra stride given to you by the stilts should give the impression of a very tall, two-legged hoofed creature.

Once you reach the house, just go ahead and come in through the back door.  Hopefully there's a lot of mud caked to the cow hooves by now, as you want to leave tracks through the house.

As for where to go from here, that depends on the house.  If you have a pull down ladder for the attic I would recommend stopping the hoofprints just underneath it, otherwise try make the mud prints last just long enough to get just past the entrance to the master bedroom.

Next step, move out and dispose of all evidence.  A good-sized dog will completely devour those cow hooves in a matter of hours.  Donate the stilts to charity.  Be careful not to disturb the footprints until the ground has dried.  Ignore everything your mother taught you and leave the mud there in the carpet until you're gone.

Then just wait for the new owners to move in and profit. |-| 
|-| co9eo7d || 23 || A single, fancy looking antique. Maybe a small chest or a mirror. Bonus if there's an inscription in a language not imediately identifiable. If horror movies have taught me anything, it's that demons live in stuff like that.  |-| 
|-| co9ez65 || 25 || As a white elephant gift I once got a little pig that you put in your refrigerator that oinked when you opened the door. My landlords foreclosed on my triplex and I was made to move out when it was aquired by the bank. I left the pig in the frige when I moved. 
Not the creepiest, but I'll bet it gave someone a start. |-| 
|-| co9hr4y || 20 || A memory card stashed somewhere, with a video of you on it, wearing a mask and tied to a chair, screaming help me, and crying about how you don't want to die "like this".  Video must be shot in the basement, or attic if sufficiently creepy, have carnival music in the background and funhouse mirrors all around you, perhaps a strobe light and some fog too, throw in some random sound fx like cars breaking hard and wolves howling at the moon. |-| 
|-| co99xm6 || 55 || A torture chamber. |-| 
|-| co9gwam || 17 || A scrappy wooden box. Rub some dirt on it, put a spider web over it.

Place it in the corner of the attic, basement etc.. Some eerie place that is either hard to get to or rarely visited.

Inside the box leave a note that says:

"You shouldn't have opened the box.."

Make sure the paper looks really old too. |-| 
|-| co9ch1p || 44 || In high school I worked for a guy who bid on cleaning out repossessed houses from the bank. I've found a lot of creepy shit. Once we found a hidden room with nothing but a padlock on the door and only thing in the room was a mattres and a lamp.
In a really nice house we found 5 deep freezers in the basement filled  survivel foods. He also had a room of things to trade and many plans of the city. He also had blue prints of key buildings in the city. |-| 
|-| co9hj0p || 17 || I lived in Alabama and had killed a nice sized buck during hunting season. Unfortunately, I hung his antlers and skull plate from a rope in the thick trees of the fenced in back yard and they were gnawed up by squirrels. They were difficult to see, but I'm sure after I moved out that the new Asian home owners eventually found them hanging ritualistically from a branch.  |-| 
|-| co9h44a || 29 || A talking Boony doll.

Back in the summer of 2006, the marketing geniuses at Carlton United Breweries gave away a talking David Boon doll with every carton of Victoria Bitter beer. 

David Boon is an Australian cricketer with a legendary appetite for beer. He once consumed over 50 cans on a flight from Australia to England.

Anyway, the dolls apparently worked on a timer, and started chatting away when the cricket was about to start. Stuff like "Cricket's about to start, grab us a beer" and "Got any nachos? I love nachos".

Pretty amusing stuff if you're expecting it. Pretty terrifying if someone leaves one stashed in the cupboard of your new rental house, which is exactly what happened to a Queensland woman. She started hearing a gravelly, muffled voice at odd times. Believed it was a ghost and got so scared she decided to move out.

During the packing the Boony doll was discovered, and she recognised the voice as her ghostly tormentor. 

*GOT ANY NACHOS?*

|-| co9huko || 13 || When I was in uni I went to this party at someone's house (in the student village) and we found this little door behind the fridge (kitchen was on the 3rd floor btw so it was next to an attic space). So being curious we opened the door and went through to the attic space to have a look.

We found:
3 black bags full of (what looked like) human hair
A wall of photos (from the university's student village, we guessed late 80's early 90's due to what people wore) with the eyes and faces scratched out Se7en style.
Some old sleeping bag
and a very large purple dildo.

After a while my son asked if he could draw something on the wall behind the microwave, I agreed. He drew something he found, I call it the gate to hell,like a large creepy open cave mouth in a dark landscape. He found the picture online and free hand drew it on the wall. It is pretty creepy.

Three years later I got around to replacing a the microwave. Son asked me for 2 days to finish up his picture. He finished, we installed the microwave. It will stay hidden until the microwave goes out or is replaced. I'd love to see the reaction when its found... |-|

I left it hanging on a string in the middle of the living room about eye level.  I always wonder what he thought about coming to his empty rental place &amp; seeing a dildo hanging for all to see in the middle of the living area......hopefully he was showing it to potential renters....lol |-|

|-| co9gqrt || 4 || About a decade ago two friends and I were moving into a new apartment. The apartment was basically the second floor of a house, but with it's own entrances and utilities, and the landlord (about 26 years old) lived downstairs.

We were moving some stuff into my roommate's closet, and there was a short message written in pencil on the wall inside the closet that read "to anyone considering renting this place, you should probably know that the landlord is insane."

He turned out to be a pretty weird guy. His dad owned the place and he took care of it. Seemed a bit off. Not like serial killer off, but definitely not all there. Kinda guy that would ask you to fix his computer and then pull up porn right in front of you as soon as you get it working again, like that is a socially acceptable thing to do. Seemed like maybe the dad had kind of abusive at some point. He was really intimidated by the old man. |-|

Two brothers who are assassins are sent to kill somebody who stole from their boss on their way they run into all sorts of odd scenarios. It's an easy read and an interesting book about humanity, I think it could easily make for a very entertaining film under the right direction. |-|

|-| co9h210 || 4 || Clive Barker's Weaveworld. Starting Gene Hackman as Shadwell, Tilda Swinton as Immacolata, and directed by Guillermo DelToro. Someone please make this happen.

|-| co9hjtg || 3 || The Eternal Champion. A series of stories that overlap in parts, involving a Champion that incarnates all over the universe in different times where needed, rarely remembering who else they've been. Fighting between the lords of Law and Chaos. Separate movies for Elric of Melnibone, Dorian Hawkmoon, and Corum at the least. I didn't get to reading the others, there are many more stories. But there's a ton of fun reading among just those three. I'd want to get Elric done right first. Or a video game of Elric, I'd settle for that. |-|

|-| co9ern1 || 5 || Skullduggery Pleasant - Derek Landy |-| 
|-| co9kkmz || 4 || Long time lurker here, am finally taking the plunge to throw Gary Paulsen's relatively short novel "The Car" into the mix. I read it as a kid and it seemed so epic to me then. A 14 year old kid who sorta just minds his own business, goes to school, mows lawns for rainy day money is suddenly thrown into an interesting situation. His folks are always fighting and one night his dad calls home and tells him he's done with them, he's not coming home. Mom calls later and says pretty much the same thing. The kid's so surprised he doesn't mention to either of them that he's essentially been abandoned in his home by both of them. He doesn't particularly care for either parent and decides he's going to track down a distant uncle he's only ever heard of across the country. Instead of taking a Greyhound bus there, he puts together an old kit car his mechanic dad had sitting in their garage that a trucker once gave to him as a kind of payment for a job. The kid pretty much follows the instructions, ends up with a kick ass car, and starts driving cross country. Along the way he meets an old hitchhiking Vietnam vet named Waylon and the dude takes him upon himself to sort of show this kid the proper way to road trip, and they mix it up with cool biker friends, hear old oral history being told by this old Native American dude on the way, and a bunch of other things I can still sort of recall all these years later. I remember this book fondly and I occasionally look it up to see if anyone has ever considered making it into a movie, but I'm doubtful since the book barely has a Wikipedia page and the story itself was never as big as Gary Paulsen's "Hatchet" If I could have one celebrity take a look at this story as a potential movie for themselves, it'd be the great Mr. Jeff Bridges as Waylon. A wise road trip companion that doubles as a coming of age story for this kid, yeah I'd love to see that.  |-| 
|-| co9g2l2 || 3 || It's already a film, actually it was already eight films, and it's Harry Potter and it was highly popular. However, I'd like to see all seven books compressed into one long film- kind of like the A Series of Unfortunate Events movie was.

Edit: I accidentally said eight books. I meant seven. |-| 
|-| co92t20 || 363 || I work at a small restaurant that is open breakfast lunch and dinner. Im the chef in the morning and its normally really slow, so il make breakfast for this elderly man that lives across the street and some eggs for his dog, then walk them over.

He used to be a regular in the morning, but fell recently and has trouble walking across the street now.  Its just my way of showing him we miss him.

 |-| 
|-| co921md || 90 || Complimenting someone on something they're wearing. Its a really really easy thing to do and it goes a long way especially when its someone you don't know!  |-| 
|-| co92xtp || 72 || Whenever I'm walking to get food, if I pass a homeless person, I tell them where I am going and ask if they want anything.

Sometimes they come with me, and we get to sit and chat.

sometimes they ask for just a burger, and I'll get them 2.

A lot of times they just want people to acknowledge that they exist. |-| 
|-| co96yon || 72 || As a very tall person I always help people stuggling with high shelves in supermarkets. I'll also move things from the back of the shelf to the front so others can reach. |-| 
|-| co93i52 || 160 || I work at a fast food coffeeshop, 2nd shift. At the end of my shift we throw out all of our pastries. Given the fact I grew up in a very frugal home, it causes me physical pain to do this. So when it gets to be 8 or 9pm, I start giving away donuts for the simplest things.

Smile at me? Donut.

Have cute kids? Donut.

Laugh at my shitty puns? Motherfucking donut.

It is something simple, but it tends to make people happy and therefore make me happy. |-| 
|-| co91od6 || 100 || Clearing a neighbors driveway. It takes 10 minutes and I already have the snowblower out.  |-| 
|-| co91uvh || 47 || Pay for the person behind me in the drive thru. |-| 
|-| co915vl || 193 || Smiling at the cashier, wishing them a nice day.  |-| 
|-| co91rq7 || 35 || When I use a gift card, leaving the remainder at the register for the next person to use. Whether it's a little or a lot, it's a great way to randomly make their day better, especially when I might just end up losing it or never going back. |-| 
|-| co91m5j || 32 || Giving someone a real and genuine compliment, nothing too complicated, just something that will make them smile. |-| 
|-| co92nu7 || 36 || I live in NYC, and there are usually homeless or poor people at my home subway stop trying to get swiped through the turnstile so they can take the train because they can't afford it. When I get off the train to go home, I usually swipe a person through. I already paid for my infinite rides so I'm both not spending any additional money and I'm helping someone out. |-| 
|-| co91o4v || 146 || In my city we have passes that give you unlimited trips on our public transit system for the day. When I buy one to run errands I always leave it at a bus stop/station so someone else can travel for free for the rest of the day. |-| 
|-| co96aio || 22 || Random baked goods. If I've baked something and I talk to you, you are getting some. If I have a craving for doughnuts at work I'll buy a dozen on break and leave them in the lunch room. If I'm sleeping with you, you goddamn know you'll have more cookies, muffins, and brownies than you'll know what to do with. |-| 
|-| co923mx || 21 || I work in a knitting shop, I enjoy encouraging people on their creative projects, I know how overwhelming it can be learning a new skill, it's so much fun encouraging people to go for it!  I've had a few people come back to me saying thanks for help and showing me finished projects, it's only a small thing I can do but it makes me feel nice to do it. |-|

|-| co93lwn || 19 || Any time i see someone having car troubles I pull over to ask if they need help, fully willing to if they ask. But most of the time they tell me everything is alright. |-| 
|-| co91lw5 || 52 || I buy homeless people cheap fast food. Sometimes I eat the meal with them. |-| 
|-| co9370k || 44 || When I find pennies on the ground that aren't face up, I flip them over.  |-| 
|-| co92cjc || 34 || Parking far away from the store. It's not like the extra minute of walking will kill me, but it may make a whole lot of difference to someone else |-| 
|-| co91t9x || 53 || I like finding an old person/couple and paying for their items. My children like to find other children their age at the store and taking them to the toy isle and letting them pick something out. |-| 
|-| co91kub || 52 || Giving gold.  |-| 
|-| co950lr || 30 || Being nice to old people and giving them a friendly bit of time out of your day.

We'll all get there someday |-| 
|-| co93fq7 || 27 || We get randomly assigned for a 24 hour duty  each month that has to be done every night. Sometimes I like to switch with those that have it on the weekend so they can spend more time with their families. |-| 
|-| co92got || 12 || -Buying the person behind me's coffee
-Buying the person behind me's bus pass
-Drawing pictograms for coworkers having a rough day
-Giving bartenders and servers HUGE tips |-| 
|-| co91ye7 || 12 || Giving people a little more time on a bowling lane. |-| 
|-| co927qy || 12 || At a gas station and buying the persons coffee in front of me who is scrambling for their money. |-| 
|-| co95nwg || 12 || If the person in front of me at the store doesn't have enough money for their groceries (Ex. has to put something back) I will pay the difference. This is if I have extra money.

I did this for someone at Christmas one year, and him and his wife (with a young baby) waited until I came out of the store and thanked me a million times over. It was very nice :) |-| 
|-| co92rhj || 24 || Volunteering with the elderly. Getting to know their stories. |-| 
|-| co923dz || 33 || Leave the waitress a bigger tip than usual

Go the extra mile to be nice with customer service people |-| 
|-| co92dl7 || 10 || Holding the door open for anyone and everyone. It's my own form of social rebellion. |-| 
|-| co91mtd || 30 || Simply opening the door for others and smiling.  |-| 
|-| co91lmm || 9 || Playing to people's good side. Complimenting them and giving them extra attention. |-| 
|-| co94x7h || 10 || When I leave a store that gave me pennies for change, I scatter the pennies heads up on the ground so superstitious people will have good luck  |-| 
|-| co92wjs || 19 || I live in an apartment complex that gives 50.00 dollar fines for having a trash bag outside of your door. Anytime I'm heading out and see that someone has a trash bag outside I just take it to the dumpster for them. I usually leave a note to just pass it forward.  |-| 
|-| co9154b || 61 || Tossing packs of skittles at homeless people and telling them to taste the motherfucking rainbow |-| 
|-| co94r5u || 20 || I always carry post-it notes with me, and love to write little feel good notes on them, such as, "You're beautiful", "Don't worry, you got this!", or "I believe in you!". I'll stick them on random cars when I walk by or leave them in books or magazines in stores. |-| 
|-| co95fe5 || 18 || I stay indoors so other people don't have to put up with me? |-| 
|-| co92f61 || 8 || Shoveling my neighbor's driveway. |-| 
|-| co933u1 || 8 || Giving up my seat on the train.  |-| 
|-| co97lmz || 8 || When I see someone having a bad day I say hello and talk to them. Of course sometimes people just want to be alone but the simple gesture of communicating with someone else is enough to have a conversation. My sister does this and it really helped me get through tough times. You wouldn't believe what a difference it can make when someone *listens* to you.

I don't really see this as an act of kindness, just something that would make my mother proud. And it's great to know you can leave this world a better place than you found it. |-| 
|-| co93rtl || 7 || Back when I was looking for a job: if I found good jobs that I wasn't suited for, I'd pass them along to friends.  I like to think the karmic payoff resulted in me getting a job after a long spell of unemployment. |-| 
|-| co9403l || 7 || Last time I went to stay with my sister we were driving in the countryside when we saw a young man. It was absolutely pissing it down so we stopped and picked him up. Turns out him and his friend from uni had arranged to meet somewhere equidistant between their home towns. A couple of minutes later we found his friend. They'd been travelling since the early hours of the morning, mostly on foot. We dropped them at a pub. |-| 
|-| co93mzw || 6 || Give up my seat on the subway.  I don't like sitting on the subway, never have, but I'll occasionally sit down if it's relatively empty.  I'll almost always give it up to anyone, and it usually makes their day.  Requires little effort and makes the other person happy.  Win-win situation. |-| 
|-| co9fcch || 11 || I was in a pretty bad accident and a known drug dealer called 911 and bailed. He was the only witness.  |-| 
|-| co92sop || 26 || Upvoting threads.  It feels nice to make a difference. |-| 
|-| co9dg4t || 10 || I like to pick up litter...specifically plastics and recyclables.  I try to do a little bit each day.  Keeps that stuff out of the local lakes and makes things a little nicer....
 |-| 
|-| co931vp || 5 || My town uses those parking meters that give you a receipt to place in your window. I  often drop a few coins in as I leave so the next person to come along already has some minutes available. |-| 
|-| co9crhq || 6 || Giving food. My mother was always pretty restrictive with food and I lost a lot of weight, so my teachers at school would always give me some of theirs. Their kindness helped me get through a lot, so I associate giving food with love and happiness. If I want to tell someone I care about them I give them food, and if someone takes the time to make me food then I appreciate it more than words can explain. Being given food is one of the few happy memories I can always rely on to give me faith in the world. I just want to share that with others. |-| 
|-| co9dm1m || 5 || Whenever I borrow someone's car I always fill it up with gas no matter how much is in the car. Usually they don't notice and I never say anything.  |-| 
|-| co9dnmm || 5 || If i'm in a taxi home from a night out and want to get some food, i always buy the taxi driver the same or whatever they want as well as a thank you for going out of their way for me. |-| 
|-| co9etw4 || 5 || When a car stops at the white stripes on the street, I raise my hand and smile to them while running over the street to make them lose the least amount of time as possible. Sometimes, I even just slow down before reaching the stripes so the cars don't stop and they don't have to brake. It's a habit, I can't stop it.  |-| 
|-| co9fl8l || 5 || I would buy 2-3 bags of dog biscuits and give em at random strays during my daily commute.  |-| 
|-| co92531 || 14 || at grocery stores where you have to put a quarter in the cart to unlock it, I usually leave my quarter in the cart, or just give the cart to someone walking in. 

Edit: wow, gold in less than 2 minutes. that's definitely a record for me. Thanks! |-| 
|-| co923pz || 12 || The person giving the gold is a legend, and will not be forgotten. |-| 
|-| co92xdz || 5 || If I buy a park-ticket for a day and I'm done and have some time left, or as said the whole day I give that to people waiting at the ticket automate. |-| 
|-| co937px || 4 || Thanking older veterans, normaly Vietnam or Korea, for their service. I don't know why, it just feels right. They almost always appreciate it.  |-| 
|-| co93tmv || 4 || Going out of my way to assist anybody I can  in hopes that they pass forward the kindness and thus the world will become less of a giant shit.  

Also, at work I'm one of the only males and probably the youngest in the office, so I am the go to guy for birthday decoration hanging, feels good to be a gangsta.  |-| 
|-| co94rs8 || 4 || Buying lunch for a homeless person.

But just because I bought you lunch doesn't mean I'm gonna chauffeur you someplace, so stop asking. you are *not* getting in my car! |-| 
|-| co95l01 || 4 || I like to give the pizza guy $10. They put up with a lot of crap.  |-| 
|-| co974n7 || 4 || Sometimes I'll pay for the gas of the next couple of people behind me |-| 
|-| co97jjs || 4 || Complimenting people, it seems small but it can really turn someone's day around |-| 
|-| co9dciz || 5 || Pay it forward at the drive-thru, especially if you pick up coffee on the way to work. A free cup of coffee can really brighten someone's day! |-| 
|-| co9f6y0 || 4 || I like to buy a couple small bunches of flowers occasionally and give them to someone who looks like they need a pick me up. I usually choose a mother that looks a bit overwhelmed to either hand it to or leave on their car. 

I also like paying tolls for the car behind me. |-| 
|-| co92nzk || 3 || Holding doors open or rushing ahead to open a door |-| 
|-| co92y72 || 3 || Pulling over and helping cars/ motorcycles on the side of the road. |-| 
|-| co94yxo || 3 || Seeing a homeless person on the sidewalk and sitting with them to have a nice chat about whatever with a cup of coffee. Just giving them the time of day to care about them as a human being.  |-| 
|-| co9bmdr || 3 || Holding my hand to block direct sunlight from my pts eyes.  |-| 
|-| co9coz5 || 3 || Sometimes I get bored and volunteer at the local animal shelter and Pet smart. I love animals. |-| 
|-| co9effy || 3 || I give free carpool rides to fellow students in my university. Usually people expect $1, but I don't accept any money. I let them choose the music too, and finally I leave them at or near their homes before I go home myself. |-| 
|-| co9f12v || 4 || I love giving homeless people food/money. The homeless are no different than you and I, it's just that they've been dealt a bad card by life. The least I can do is give them some food or money. 

There was a homeless guy at a gas station holding the door for people, so I handed him a 10 when I walked past. When I came out, I had gotten him a sandiwch and some coffee. Just little things like that make their shittly lives way better because they know people still have faith in them.  |-| 
|-| co9g3la || 3 || I'm sure any of my go-tos are taken, but I wanted to acknowledge an act of kindness on me today. I'm new and unsure how to tag someone in a response, but user Glennznl messaged me after I posted a slightly morbid topic to make sure I was okay. It brightened my day and I don't think I'll forget it for a long time.  |-| 
|-| co9379y || 8 || My fiancée loves bananas. If I'm at the grocery or convenience store I will grab her a bunch and just put them on our banana stand without telling her. Also if she is sick, I will get her a cup of chili and orange juice from her favorite restaurant. |-| 
|-| co92eju || 5 || Taco night - I always get my wife one dollar taco night, and she always acts surprised.  |-| 
|-| co92h0k || 3 || Helping the aged cross the road... |-| 
|-| co93wpa || 7 || Whenever I'm on a date with my girlfriend, if there is a woman eating by herself, I'll anonymously cover something from her meal (not the entire thing). If we're at someplace small like a café, I'll buy her the entire thing, especially if she looks like she could use the pick-me-up. I try to leave before she gets the bill so she'll never know who it was. |-| 
|-| co9auuy || 3 || I'm a random cash to the homeless sort of guy.  It is easy to do and if it pays for alcohol for some people, so be it.  I do believe it pays for food for some people too.     |-| 
|-| co9fawo || 3 || My school makes everyone get 9 hours of "community service", which I am think is kind of against what community service is about, so I always make sure to go there extra mile and work extra hard. I really enjoy doing community service, and feel a little bad getting school credit for it. |-| 
|-| co93fd9 || 3 || Asking people how they are/what they think: including them in the conversation.  
I have been the weird awkward guy enough times to know how much appreciated this can be. |-| 
|-| co916ff || -7 || Putting rufies in someone's drink. |-| 
|-| co95ocr || 329 || Yes. I'd fuck the shit out of her. 

Why? Because we'd be mutually horny fucks - why not? |-| 
|-| co95p0z || 452 || "Would you fuck me?... I'd fuck me" |-| 
|-| co97z80 || 51 || Depends, how big are my tits? |-| 
|-| co96jv6 || 108 || I'd do it, i mean i already masturbate to myself in the mirror. The reason i haven't fucked myself yet is because i don't like the feeling of things in my asshole and my dick isn't long enough. |-| 
|-| co95qxp || 160 || God no. I don't even really understand my wife still fucks me.  Have you *seen me*? |-| 
|-| co95xrx || 58 || Nah my GF probably wont like that.

May be down for a 3 some though...
 |-| 
|-| co95qak || 52 || did the clone look the exact same with just opposite genitalia?
 |-| 
|-| co967uu || 26 || In a heartbeat. My clone would know exactly what was up without instruction. I hate how-to sex. It's uncomfortable. 

Also, I'd be willing to bet he could grow a world class beard. I've always been curious about that. Dunno why. |-| 
|-| co95zc5 || 37 || I'm into chubbies.  So... yes. Because the female version of me probably doesn't get laid that much either.   |-| 
|-| co960fg || 35 || I would fuck her so hard that she made me another clone. Then another and another and even more until they finally take over the world MWAHAHAHAHAHA! |-| 
|-| co994rv || 26 || Hell yeah. I'd fuck the non-genderbent me too. How about both at the same time? That sounds fun. Better mske it a foursome actually,  just to make it fair. Don't wanna leave out girl-me for all the gay sex opportunities |-| 
|-| co9f8s2 || 44 || The Clone Song

By: Isaac Asimov

Tune: Home On The Range

Oh, give me a clone

Of my own flesh and bone

With its Y chromosome changed to X.

And after it's grown,

Then my own little clone

Will be of the opposite sex.

Clone, clone of my own,

With its Y chromosome changed to X.

And when I'm alone

With my own little clone

We will both think of nothing but sex.

Oh, give me a clone,

Is my sorrowful moan,

A clone that is wholly my own.

And if she's X-X,

And the feminine sex,

Oh, what fun we will have when we're prone.

Clone, clone of my own,

With its Y chromosome changed to X.

And when I'm alone

With my own little clone

We will both think of nothing but sex.

My heart's not of stone,

As I've frequently shone

When alone with my own little X.

And after we've dined,

I am sure we will find

Better incest then Oedipus Rex.

Clone, clone of my own,

With its Y chromosome changed to X.

And when I'm alone

With my own little clone

We will both think of nothing but sex.

Why should such sex vex,

Or disturb or perplex,

Or induce a disparaging tone?

After all, don't you see,

Since we're both of us me,

When we're having sex, I'm alone.

Clone, clone of my own,

With its Y chromosome changed to X.

And when I'm alone

With my own little clone

We will both think of nothing but sex.

And after I'm done

She will still have her fun,

For I'll clone myself twice ere I die.

And this time without fail,

They'll be both of them male,

And they'll each ravage her by and by.

Clone, clone of my own,

With its Y chromosome changed to X.

And when I'm alone

With my own little clone

We will both think of nothing but sex. |-|

Not just for *sex*, but also for a "best friendship" with no boundaries, in which we can say or do anything around one another with no limitations.

Most of our friendship would probably revolve around conversation and people-watching in the park or something, but I'd like to think that we'd also enjoy playing Strip Scrabble or just watching Netflix (while enjoying the casual and only semi-sexual nature of any nudity).  |-|

If it is an alternate universe clone:

* Am I going to absorb some freaky radiation and then implode if we make contact? 

* Is she stuck here or if not do I have to worry about getting her back?

* would this act in any way alter the known universe?

If it is an altered genetics clone:

* who made it? 

* How was the aging accelerated and stopped at the correct point?

* Since it would be the same base genetics wouldn't this one be incest?

* don't the ethics of this type of clone seem questionable, since I am making it to have sex with?

He was in third grade and behaviorally he acted like he was a toddler. Sometimes he seemed sort of able to read, but frequently he was so out of it that if you asked him a question he'd just stare at you blankly. I was trying to convince his parent to get the child tested so that we'd know what was going on and could address it. I had notes from previous teachers saying that they had tried the same thing and failed to convince the parents. 

This was the first year that the state was implementing a mandatory reading test at the end of third grade, and any child who didn't pass it would have to repeat the grade unless they were in special ed. I told the parents that even if I worked with their son during every spare minute of my time for the rest of the year, there was no way he would pass the test. They were insistent that he would. He didn't. I'm no longer with that school, so I have no idea what happened, but I feel terrible for the poor kid. His parents won't have him tested and none of the teachers who have taught him have been able to figure out what the problem is, so they can't even attempt to address it. I worry about what his life will be like. |-|

|-| co9ez63 || 81 || I'm hesitant to comment, because the question was directed specifically to teachers. however....I'm going to anyway!

When I was in high school, it was standard practice to have a teacher/student meeting, followed by a parent/teacher/student conference when entering junior year in order to discuss college/aptitudes/focus of studies, etc.

Well, my conference didn't go as planned I guess, as the teacher couldn't wrap her mind around the fact that I had no guardian/parent/family for which could come to the meeting.  I had left home a few years earlier, and moved to a different state.  Legally, I had a guardian, my father, but he lived in Germany and I hadn't lived with him since I was 10. Well, the consequence for not bringing a parent to the meeting was detention. Continued failure to comply, resulted in additional detention up to a certain limit, don't remember the number now, finally resulting in expulsion.  It was a very odd situation, I really couldn't comply, there was no way to.  I actually had to get a school counselor to act as my adult during the meeting. The whole thing was silly. |-|

|-| co9csgo || 91 || Tangentially related story but one I haven't had the chance to tell before.

My mum's old colleague got a new job at a super fancy private school in Sydney, Australia.

Before her first set of parent teacher interviews, the principal called a staff meeting and said "For all the new teachers out there who don't know, if a set of parents bring their *house barrister*, you are to inform them that you are unable to undertake a conference and leave it at that.  Do not, under any circumstances, answer *any* questions in the presence of the barrister."

Rich people are Fucked. In. The. Head. |-| 
|-| co9ilnf || 48 || Not a teacher, but the work in the tech department at an inner-city high school. 

Although I'm not involved directly with any parent-teacher conferences, I am usually directly involved the next day if they turn south...

Now I'll start off by saying that our school has a good mix of low-income bracket kids, probably about 50-60%, and for the most part the kids at the school in general are a bit worse than normal high school kids (see pictures in profile for further details), but their parents really take the cake when it comes to acting like shit. Either way, MANY students wind up on the wrong side of the law, you'll see a few examples why in a minute.

The first month I started at the school, I responded to a ticket where apparently some kid's father became slight upset (read enraged) when presented with the fact that his child wasn't quite meeting standards in the class. I'll admit I was slightly impressed when I walked into the classroom and found the teacher's CRT computer monitor EMBEDDED inside the classroom TV. He had literally thrown a smaller CRT inside of another, larger CRT. This is no easy feat seeing as the glass on those things are easily 1/4-1/2" in the front.

I've lost count of the number of hard drives I've had to replace from the times students (or parents in some cases) have thrown/pushed computers off of tables and desks in fits of rage. I'd say the average life span for computer equipment was about 4-6 months before succumbing to blunt force trauma, vandalism, or other forms of physical and electronic torture that'd make the CIA blush.

If you ever need a quick weapon in a fight, I'd recommend a keyboard based simply on the number of them I've found thrown and punched into drywall. I always find it funny that stuff just sticks in drywall like that, like someone purposely installed it there as modern art. 

Our district managed to find the funding to provide all the schools in our district with iPad carts. If any of you have seen these before, they are metal rolling carts that house about 30 iPads on charging racks that the teachers use to teach the kids with. We set the district record for the fastest to loose the program. Much like the keyboards, the iPad holocaust was quick and brutal. I think I'll just try to bullet point the stats I wrote down.

*Number of cracked or broken screens: 12 (never replaced)

*Number of units damaged beyond repair: 9

*Number of units stolen: 18

*Number of units still operable: 3

*Time before first broken screen: 3 hours (Same day we made them available)

*Time before first unit damaged beyond repair: 2 weeks, 4 days

*Time before first theft: 1 month, 1 week, 0 days (All 18 stolen at once when a teacher left the cart unlocked)

*Total time of program at our school: Exactly 2 months

Someone also embedded one of the iPads in the drywall as well, but it survived fully intact.

Speaking of theft, mice and keyboard keys seem to disappear rather quickly around here, most likely due to their small size. In addition to these small thefts, thin clients and laptops tend to get stolen sometimes as well. We've even had a student steal two desktops (found a day later in his locker) despite kensington locks, but I digress.

Now you might be wondering, where did the 18 iPads go? Surly they have features that let you track them in case they get stolen, right? Yes, you are correct and yes, we did find the iPads. The iPads were found in a pawn shop owned by the parent of the student who (we suspect) took them. How did we identify them? They had our school name and campus number laser engraved on the back without any attempt to remove the engraving. We'd have them back, but according to the head of the tech department they are still sitting in an evidence locker as the owner of the pawn shop is on trial for running a less-than-honest business.

Unfortunately, I don't have any more juicy parent-teacher conference stories that I have, after all I only hear them 2nd hand.

EDIT: Fixed formatting (I hope)
 |-| 
|-| co9j3bp || 20 || Not a teacher, but every parent/teacher conference for my kid's school has had some weird scheduling hiccup. The first year, I got my little slip in the mail saying when and where it would be. It was scheduled for 7:45 am. Weird, but I thought maybe they just had such a big class this year they had to do a few in the am. Showed up and the school wasn't even open yet. Stood outside for 15 minutes before finally going home. Went home to check the slip thinking I was an idiot, nope. Said 7:45 am. It was at 7:45 pm, they just messed up. 

Second year, showed up on time. 4:15. First conference of the day. Teacher wasn't even there. Finally someone called her cell. She forgot all about them. 

Third, the mom before me sat and gossiped with the teacher for half an hour. Not sure why the teacher didn't cut them off. 

It's a good school, but sheesh, get your shit together.  |-| 
|-| co9azbd || 53 || There was an issue I had with this one student a few years back. This student was always a problem with every teacher, and then when I finally had him in my class, he became *my* problem. 

After dealing with him for a short while, I called a parent teacher conference, but since this kid was always trouble, I had an asst. principal to be there too. 

The mother came in, and after I aired my grievances, she looked at me straight in eyes and yelled, "My son can do *no* wrong! Not at all! You just can't do your job right!"

At that point, I (mentally) checked out of the meeting. The next day, the kid came in with new shoes too. A couple of months later, after enough teachers calling his mom with different issues, the student transferred. 

EDIT: A word. |-| 
|-| co9lcst || 18 || During my first proper year of teaching, I had a Year 5 class and this boy had a massive crush on me. Like to the point of being a right little shit every minute of the day to get my attention. Thing is he used to be the best-behaved child like, ever and then turned into a screeching, hyperactive, disruptive, defiant, and downright creepy little hellion. And it got old, fast. I was terrified to tell anyone, as kids tend to make shit up in those circumstances and our senior leadership was quite corrupt. So I basically just kept my head down, tolerated this kid's increasingly awful behaviour, and hoped he'd get over me and crush on someone else his own age. 

Well that never happened. Got to the point where I was unable to get through lessons and the kids were starting to tease him. Some months later I was like fuck this shit and rang up his parents for an interview. But it's not like I could have been like "I think your son likes me", because that would have been fucking weird. So instead I sat there with him and his parents and listed every irritating and borderline creepy behaviour I dealt with daily, hoping that they'd reach some sort of conclusion in their heads. 

Well they didn't. We were literally sat there for an hour as I gave example after example and it just Didn't. Fucking. Click. The parents kept asking their son to explain his behaviour, and naturally he just shrugs and his disposition swung between smarmy and overconfident to scared shitless. He was one of those kids who had his parents wrapped around his finger, as this was definitely not the first time I had spoken to his mum about his questionable behaviour. And as soon as I ran out of examples, my TA (who was in the room to cover my ass if needed), actually burst out laughing. The parents were confused by this, but then started laughing as well, which made me wonder if they'd clued in. 

Most awkward meeting ever. 

The parents didn't figure it out until about a month later when said pupil found out I had a boyfriend and threatened suicide. When I made a report, the protection officer literally had to ring up the parents, inform them of what happened, and then say "I think your son has a crush on his teacher." Only then did it click. But when his parents spoke to him about his feelings, his conduct in the classroom went from annoyingly disruptive to all-out Phantom of the Opera. Luckily we only had a few weeks left that that point. 

It will be difficult for me to top the squirm factor of that interview. 

Edit: a few sentences. |-| 
|-| co9jtma || 14 || My wife is a 3rd grade teacher. A few years ago, a parent showed up with the kid, and she had an incredibly awkward conversation about the students falling grades. Why awkward? The dad said "I know she's not good at math--I wasn't either. At least she's pretty!"

Fuck that dad. |-| 
|-| co9ldak || 14 || I had a parent come in and, with her voice breaking, ask if her son seemed to be okay. She proceeded to whisper (her son was there too) that she'd been sexually assaulted with her husband lying in bed next to her and the kids in the other room. She wanted to know how traumatized her son was and how much I thought he understood. I told her he wrote a story about mommy fighting off a bad guy and then having a barbeque (she immediately sent her kids to her mom's) and was still doing well with his schoolwork, hugged her quickly (probably a dumb thing to do, but it was instinct) and somehow managed not to start crying until they were gone. It wasn't bad because the parent did something wrong, but working in a low income district, you are constantly aware of the shitty things happening to your kids that you have no control over. That really drove it home. It just made me so mad at the world. |-| 
|-| co9c31d || 36 || 80% of these are a waste I felt.  The really good students don't need it, and the troubled children usually have a behavior inherited from their parents who will make excuses for them or the other extreme.  |-| 
|-| co9c4qq || 41 || (Repost from another question)  Started out as the worst....then the right words came:        Taught third grade a long, long, time ago, when teachers were allowed to run their classrooms, and mornings before school were a time when the kids and teachers talked a lot. We also played all kinds of games, and got pretty wild some times...(did I say there were 48 kids in a class?)...anyway, a parent comes in to a parent-teacher conference and tells me what her child told her happens in my class. The story was quite exaggerated. So, I looked her squarely in the eyes, and said slowly, "You believe half of what your child says happens in my class, and I will believe half of what your child says happens at home".  |-| 
|-| co9clpc || 17 || Its the worst when the parents fight about a parenting issue I'm front of you and try to get you to pick a side. Also I have had parents flirt with each other and get handsy and frisky in the conference. Its extra gross when they're unattractive.  |-|

|-| co9cgo1 || 17 || I wonder where the teacher who gave kevins' everywhere a bad name is. |-|

She had to call both sets of parents down, when asking the kid what possessed him to do that he answered "That's what daddy does"

|-| co9gz5d || 7 || Parent-teacher conferences are a breeze because only the parents of the good kids ever show up. |-| 
|-| co9jxav || 6 || I was teaching kindergarten and a parent came in arguing over their child's grade. As these grades are for parents to see where their child may improve and have no bearing on their future otherwise, I couldn't understand the rationale. After 10 minutes of trying to understand her argument, I took back the report and hastily crossed out everything, replacing each comment with super excellent A++. |-| 
|-| co9chhn || -27 || Well, not a teacher but a parent here. We had moved to a very affluent area and my son started Kindergarten at a highly respected school. About two months had passed and his teacher called me in for a conference. We sat down and she said, "Your son is way behind the other children in my class." I'm thinking, "He's five years old, how behind can he be after two months?" But what I said was, "Behind??? Is he not eating enough glue paste?" I couldn't help myself. She then proceeded to tell me that most parents in the area held their boys back an extra year before putting them in Kindergarten so they would be bigger and better athletes when they were in high school. She also told me that he was behind because he didn't know how to read. He's fucking five! I said, "Well, isn't that your job?" I just got a bovine vapid stare back. I put him in a Waldorf school the next year.

College levels the playing field. All the bad embarrassing stuff is forgotten. All the awesome accomplishments don't mean much anymore.

It's like the bible in every class. It tells you when assignments are due, when the tests are. And sometimes that's the only time these dates are ever mentioned - you could just walk into class and it be test day, or a big project is suddenly due. But also, most professors include tips on how to best succeed in their class in the syllabus. 

Go to class.

Of say 100% the material that's covered in various chapters/assignments, only about 20% of that is usually tested/expected to be remembered - going to class tells you exactly what to study so you don't spend ridiculous amounts of time studying crap that is ultimately unimportant. Not to mention, you did pay for the classes - might as well get your money's worth.

Seek help.

If you're having trouble, of any kind - ask somebody for help, your professor, the counselor, other students, library people - learn the resources available to you and use them. They're free, why not.  |-|

If you chronically have trouble focusing on your work, see about getting put on a regular dose *and keep your dose regular*. But once you get sucked into the binge/crash vortex of amphetamines it will be **VERY VERY VERY difficult** to extract yourself from it without having your work suffer.

In fact be careful with drugs and alcohol in general. You may, like me, discover too late that you are prone to abuse and addiction, and your college experience, like mine, will go down the toilet because of it.

Tip #2: Learn how to write a damn paper. Within the first few semesters you should be required to take a class that teaches you about academic writing. If you pay very close attention during this class it will save you a LOT of work for the rest of your college experience. Learn how to identify reputable and relevant sources, to identify the main points in them, how to integrate and synthesize those into your paper for the purposes of your research question. Learn how to fucking cite your sources! The last thing you want to be doing when you're down to the wire on a term paper is wondering where parentheses and commas go. Seriously if you know how to find and use your sources your papers will practically write themselves. |-|

It's so easy to get into that weird cycle of staying up all night and living on caffeine, but in reality that paper will probably look a whole lot better if you weren't trying to write it at two in the morning.  Working normal hours and staying well rested, at least during the week can have amazing benefits.

Also, for me I found it better to find a few close friends instead of lots of kind-of-okay-friends.  In high school I had the latter and they were people I did not have a lot in common with.  Now in college I have two super close friends and feel overall happier because we all get along well.   |-|

Academically, financially and socially. 

Cheg is also your best friend. If you go to a county school wait till the first day to buy books. If you don't know for sure wait. Sometimes teachers use different materials than what the school tells you. Specially those who write their own stuff so you buy it. Fuck those professors. |-|

Go to class!

|-| co9jiwu || 9 || Develop good study habits and discipline in the first semester of your freshman year, and your GPA will thank you.  

*Everybody* has a natural tendency to slack off on the subjects they enjoy least or don't understand well, and maybe need a bit of remedial work in. But realistically, those are the subjects you need to spend the *most* time on - which admittedly is hard to do. Be aware that you will make good grades more-or-less organically, with less effort, on the subjects you enjoy the most. Perversely, those will be the courses that you will find yourself spending the most time on, and forsaking the more frustrating material, where you could really use the extra effort. 

Remember that the law of diminishing returns applies; it often takes more effort to go from a 3.7 to a 3.8 than it does to go from a 2.5 to a 3.4.   |-|

I'm about to graduate now, and I think that I've learned a lot more than the people who just take any class that allows them to sleep til noon. I've had some amazing professors and still remember a lot, even from GECs, that were 3 years ago. When the professor is interesting it makes it easy to go to class and pay attention, and you'll retain so much more information. Really helps you get an education along with your degree. |-|

Meet lots of people. My first go I didn't talk to many and it was so shitty. Meet lots of people in your classes but many out of it. The insight random people can give you when writing papers is crazy, you might get too focused on something and they open your view to something new.

Don't skip class. You will regret it. And you struggle to catch up. And remember, you are paying to be there. Skipping class is throwing money away

Drink at lunch/between classes. Im not saying get hammered, but go have 1 drink. This helped me a lot 3 years into engineering. Go have a beer with a friend somewhere. It's a much needed break and gives your brain a bit to reset before your next class. Alternatively. .....

Nap. Like drinking, let's you rest a bit so you can go back and refocus.

Save time for YOU! Always give yourself time to go do something you enjoy. If it's party, sports, reading, make sure you always make some time to do what you enjoy. Don't become a zombie with your face in a book (unless that is what you love doing). I would give myself at least an hour a day at the climbing gym to relax and get some exercise. 

Take morning classes. It gives you the rest of the day to study/work/nap. If you take a late class, chances are you will sleep in and loose several hours a day that could be utilized.

Most importantly. ......

HAVE FUN!
  |-| 
|-| co9jnq2 || 6 || Make a master syllabus of all assignments and deadlines.  |-| 
|-| co9g9g3 || 16 || Oh man. I am so peanut butter and jeaaaalous! 

Here's my input. 

1) Figure out campus and learn where streets/bars/restaurants are: It's college, and people are going to make fun of you for being a freshman and being clueless. Yes, you'll learn eventually. But it's better to learn right away. 

2) Make friends early and easily: Talk to the people on your dorm floor. Offer to have people in your room for movie/TV night. Be cool, friendly, and inviting. You can make lifelong friends from your dorm. Believe me. 

3) Befriend older people: Play sports? No? Know someone who does? ...Or, are you in a club? ...What about your classes, any upperclassmen? - Older college kids can get you booze AND invite you to cool house parties. Befriend older students.

4) Learn your limit: This may take weeks, months, or your entire college career. Figure out how much is too much. Sure, you're gonna have the nights when you think it's cool to bong six shots of vodka. We've all been there. This is when friends are essential. Making sure you have a group of friends to get you home is key in these situations. 

5) Gettin Some - This Aint High School: Whether you're a man or woman, you've gotta be careful! College age/your twenties is the prime time to explore your sexuality (maybe your whole life is, I don't know). Anyway, you're physically in your prime! Anyway whether it's your dorm or college house, you can persuade your dormmate to leave/or warn your housemates of your sexual encounter. Either way, it's an experience like nothing you've had before -no parents are gonna walk in. Learn, explore, enjoy. 

6) Figure out when you can miss class: There are some courses when you can learn everything from the book and you go to 5 out of 20 classes, andddd, there's courses where you are fuuuucked if you miss a single class. Figure out right away which you can miss, and which you can't. 

7) Establish a work schedule (which will change each semester/quarter). When will you do your HW/studying? Will you devote Tues/Thurs from 3-8 in the library, and then meet your friends after?

8) Unless you're a total sober nerd (and I
 mean that in the nicest, most respectful way), you are gonna be partying way more than you think you are: college is different. Everyone parties. Budget your study/work time into your partying time.

9) TLDR: Have fun, be yourself, don't be an idiot, good luck :)

|-| co9ecyl || 12 || New prof here.

The buck stops with you.

You get three absences in my class, I don't care what they're for. Model UN, hangover, fraternity rush, cramming for another class, stuck in the drunk tank, doesn't matter. It's up to you to get the work done within the parameters of the class.

Likewise, you don't have to take a class I recommend. Unless you need their financial support, you don't have to take the classes your parents want you to, and that includes going to law school!

You have the freedom to choose your own goals and pursue them however you want. But, you bear the consequences for your decisions, good or bad. Failure is an option, if that's what you end up choosing. Don't screw around thinking someone will bail you out. This can be scary, but it's this sort of responsibility that gives your choices, and your life, meaning.  |-| 
|-| co9jm1j || 8 || Make plans to study abroad. A full year would be best, but a semester or even just a month will do you a world of good (literally). I did a year in France and gained a hell of a lot of perspective on my life and other people's. |-| 
|-| co9f2gj || 3 || I recommend becoming close with a professor or two. Try taking multiple classes with a professor you like and make yourself stand out as a student. This will benefit you in the future if the professor will put in a good word for you, help you create contacts, and will support you throughout your education.  |-| 
|-| co9g8ak || 3 || Set up informational interviews with people working in careers you are interested in. Call or email to request 30 minutes of their time and ask them how they got where they are now. 

People love talking about themselves and mentoring students, even if it's just for a few minutes. You may even make some really good connections. |-| 
|-| co9gkjl || 3 || Its easier to write an essay by starting early if you can bang out a page or two a day. 

In between classes go study or do your reading/assignments. Gives you some free time later on in the day. |-| 
|-| co9ih11 || 4 || Don't schedule a class at eight in the morning.  I thought I would have no problem getting up and getting to class by 8 AM, after all, I had been doing it for 13 years.  Wrong.  There will always be something going on, or something to do and the next thing you know it is 2 AM.  Granted, some people can pull this off, but I could not.

Also, I wanted to add that if you are planning on taking 12 hours a semester, go ahead and throw in another class to make it 16.  After a few weeks drop the class you like the least.  It is sort of a back up plan in case one of your professors rubs you the wrong way. |-| 
|-| co9k86x || 3 || You are not and cannot be fully prepared for this. Accept and embrace that reality. Prepare for the possibility of fucking up, but even more, prepare your determination to drive through your fuck-ups.

Also, be ready to hate it. I'm not saying you will, but you might, and that can destroy your soul if you let it. |-| 
|-| co9kf3j || 4 || 1.  Don't purchase your books through the book store.
2.  READ the chapter BEFORE class - then, you'll actually know what the prof. is talking about and can ask questions for clarity.
3.  Enjoy the freedom and be social - it's a great way to make good friends and learn some life lessons.
4.  GO TO CLASS.
5.  Do your work - you/your parents are paying big $$ for you to attend.  So attend gdi. |-| 
|-| co9gpby || 5 || Got a 69? 79? 89?

Email the prof and ask them if they *pretty please* would round that mark up for you. Especially if it's a large class. 

Worst case scenario, they turn you down. Best case scenario, you get bumped up another grade level. |-| 
|-| co9fzar || 4 || If you're not completely sure what you're going to major in or even on the fence think about going to community college! It's so much cheaper for you to get your core classes done and some of the time these classes are easier then those at major universities! 

Even if it's just one year it's totally worth it. Community colleges help you get classes done while easing you in to college life more easily.  |-| 
|-| co9e64w || 3 || Talk to people who aren't like the people you'd talk to in high school.

Also, get some under-the-bed storage containers! |-| 
|-| co9e9hn || 3 || Show up to class, pay attention, do your homework, participate in class and try to have a decent relationship with your teacher.

|-| co9fsle || -4 || **Don't show up to class:** This shows your professor/teacher that you are a independent student that does not need constant assistance from a superior. Remember, independence is one of the best traits one could have at such an age. This tactic develops this important skill that you will use for the rest of your life.

**Don't do your work or study until the day before an exam:** Studies have shown that cramming studying the day before a test compresses the information in your mind, leading to more efficient memorization. If you ever have any doubts about this, remember this trick: *cram for an exam!* It rhymes, so it must work.

**Don't make friends:** Friends are nothing but an unnecessary, destructive distraction at this point in your educational career. Shun the deceptive embraces of friendship for the one thing that matters: studying.

When I'm walking up behind someone, I let slip a few scuffs of my feet on the pavement so they know I'm there (without being obvious about letting them know I'm there). I start to do this from pretty far off so they have time to realize that someone is walking behind them before I pass them (if I do).

I do something similar on my bike when I'm riding up on a pedestrian on a multi-use path. I'll stop pedaling so my ~~gears~~ hub does the *click-click-click-click* noise. 

I don't know why, but I think being subtle about it is better, sort of like, "I'm here, but it's no big deal."

|-| co9cqbu || 3 || I just grab them and say, ["I'm not going to rape you. I'm a little boy."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDZHwb-If9w) |-|

|-| co9euqj || 3 || I've lost my dad in ikea please help  |-| 
|-| co9fauc || 3 || Biggest problem for me is that I've been in marching band.  I subconsciously match my footsteps to people around me and it's creepy as fuck and I constantly have to check my walking pattern to make sure I'm not sneaking up on people.

Take loud steps that are not in time with the person in front of you's steps.  Make sure that they know you are there and that you don't care if they know you are there. |-| 
|-| co9hf28 || 3 || I put on my bowler, start whistling "Singing In The Rain," and ask them if they want to go to the Korova milkbar for some milk-plus. |-| 
|-| co98cpq || 6 || As a 5'3", 112 lb woman...nothing. If anything, I'd like to look *more* threatening, if I could. |-| 
|-| co9c54v || 6 || Be a woman |-| 
|-| co93845 || 8 || Nothing. It's not my problem if someone thinks i'm a potential rapist/murderer just for walking down the street at night. |-| 
|-| co95383 || 3 || http://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/rvzaq/the_smiling_man/ |-| 
|-| co95g5z || 3 || I stand up straight - not like I'm at attention, but so I have good posture and it doesn't seem like I'm sneaking around. |-| 
|-| co99sat || 3 || Scuff my shoes a few times. And stay back a respectable distance.  |-| 
|-| co9ad4p || 3 || I'm over 6 feet tall and have a large frame. If I'm walking at night, and someone is walking in front of me, suddenly everyone's garden becomes a lot more interesting. I just have to stop and look at all the fascinating shrubbery. |-| 
|-| co9b5ti || 3 || I fake a sneeze, then I stop for a few seconds pretending to blow my nose, then I keep on walking keeping the new distance.

If I'm close home, I jiggle my keys so the other person knows that I'm going somewhere in that direction. |-| 
|-| co9bgex || 3 || Where's the fun in that? |-| 
|-| co9bw2w || 3 || Finding another way to where I'm supposed to walk. Last year, I was at the mall and they had closed the gates to go down so I had to go around to where my parents were. I was going to go theough the right, more light up area, but as 6' 250lb guy in a hoodie I did not want to scare anybody so I went through the left, darker, less traveled size. |-| 
|-| co9g2k0 || 3 || I act like I'm on the phone.  It backfires when someone calls you though.  Then they start walking *really* fast. |-| 
|-| co959ie || 3 || be white |-| 
|-| co95yg9 || 3 || Take out my knife and and wave my arms in the air while screaming to get their attention so I can tell them I don't want to hurt them and that the knife is for self defense and hunting trips. |-| 
|-| co99e1k || 3 || As a 6'2 180 lbs guy I hate this situation, I'm super nice but just happen to like a full beard and long hair and I generally wear darker cloths so I can understand how people can perceive me as a threat. When I do find myself walking behind someone at night I make sure I am going slower then they are and my body language says I'm relaxed and doing my thing.   |-| 
|-| co9a0a6 || 3 || Tip my fedora when they look my way. |-| 
|-| co8xzoi || 118 || New country. Older country like Johnny Cash is fine, but almost all current country music is just awful, and unfortunately I live in a place where country is the most popular. |-|

Every time I have to listen to it in a public place (it is strickly forbidden to be played in my house) I feel like my ears are getting raped with a hot iron rod. The tune is the same, the vocals are awful and the lyrics are mostly about drinking, druglords  or women in a really sexist way.

I know some people want to innovate, change how things are done, or go back to the root but it's not a reason for producing music like [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQ34vBT3rwM) ! |-| 
|-| co95quw || 3 || I want my music to have some rhythm and some melody. 

I am not a big fan of ~~Hip-Hop~~ rap (can be good if paired with something melodic, but just rapping along isn't doing it for me)

Most Electro/House music doesn't have enough melody either (there are exceptions).

Interstingly enough I love Dubstep (unpopular opinion here?) |-|

|-| co8wxaj || 19 || Country, because  |-| 
|-| co8w4m6 || 36 || Dubstep is pretty awful. Not just the way it sounds but because now it has everyone obsessed with bass. Everyone's just like, "Turn up the bass! DROP THE BASS KLAHJESKORTJASDTLKJASDHFKALSDHRIK" and I'm just like, "I'd like to hear the music please. Please add some treble and turn off your face." |-| 
|-| co981k4 || 11 || Smooth Jazz. I once got my company to use Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis and John Coltrane as on hold music instead of Kenny G and Dave Koz. I feel to this day like I prevented a war crime. |-|

Now hold on, I love metal. Its energy, ferocity, everything about it. Its the fans I hate, or to be more precise a sublet of fans who argue what is true (trve) metal or how this or that isn't metal enough or whatever. The arguements become ad-libs!

"Oh metalcore/progressive/Viking/folk/doom/&lt;insert subgenre here&gt; metal isn't real metal, you &lt;words that can't be repeated in polite company&gt;!" 

"Oh you actually like The Black Album/South of Heaven/Powerslave/etc? What a &lt;expletive&gt;! &lt;Band name&gt; was way better you &lt;implication of one being a pedestrian fan&gt;." |-|

|-| co8vqac || 24 || I generally don't like gangsta rap. The mainstream hip-hop stuff is okay to me usually only when I'm drinking or being sociable. Also, country. I like Carrie Underwood and Keith Urban only for their voices (Urban's decent at guitar) and grew up on 90s country . The new generation country is horrible. It seems like all they write/sing about now is drinking beer on their tractors with their dogs or picking up sleazy women in the country clubs. They are trying to conform with the hip-hop culture and it mixes about as well as pickles and ice cream.

This is also a very regional type of music, but where I'm from we have Zydeco that everyone goes bat shit crazy over. It's terrible, I'd rather saw my ears off with a butterknife than listen to that shit. |-|

As has been stated many time above, it's all repetitious: singing about the same old things, blah blah blah. And plus, every country singer SOUNDS THE SAME. Singin' bout trucks and red solo cups  |-|

|-| co8x04r || 3 || Reggaeton (sp?) That shit is THEE WORST. |-| 
|-| co8vuuy || 4 || I am not into tecno music in general, but Dubstep really gets on my nerves. It's like listening to R2-D2 hump a tape recorder. But if you like it, hump away! |-| 
|-| co8xja6 || 3 || Country. |-| 
|-| co8vv7t || 3 || Polka.  It's one genre that I would never add to my playlist. |-|

if I wanted to listen to instruments being played discordantly I would go to a middle school talent show. |-|

Go ahead look it up, I dare you. |-| 
|-| co8viap || -6 || I don't like gangster rap because I think it glorifies the the thuggish stupidity of poor inner city youth (especially those youth's that don't have fathers).

|-| co8werf || -11 || Rap, which may not apply because it isn't even music, but people who don't know any better call it that, so, rap. |-| 
|-| co942n2 || -3 || metal. no doubt about it. |-|

Now, by hitting just a few buttons on my wrist, I have complete control over just about everything in my home without even getting off the couch.  Worth Every Penny.  

Edit:  just so everyone knows I have all lights, various appliances, home theater, hvac, and a lot more automated.  It's all controlled with my phone or my pebble.  Check out [this site](http://automateyourhome.org/pebble) for more info on how I set it up. |-|

We got a large suite, which was nice as it had separate rooms yet we were all close.  Our suite was one floor beneath the pilot area, so we had those GIANT porthole windows you see on the front of a ship.  There was an easy chair with an ottoman near one that I sat in a lot.   When the family wanted to relax in the cabin, there was plenty of place for all of us to stretch out.  At any time, I could be in my chair, my wife taking a nap on the king-sized bed, my son watching TV and my daughter and her daughter in another room relaxing, watching TV, or also taking a nap.    

I try to plan a yearly vacation so we just go away all together and reset.  This year's was the most expensive yet, but they really enjoyed it.  |-|

|-| co91qwe || 54 || In early 2014, I invested all of my savings in refined steel. Steel is cold and unemotionally, pure and logical. Though I did not own much land, I got to work and began building a railway. I did not rely on the charity of others, for one must rely on oneself and oneself alone. After 9 months and the deaths of 4,000 immigrant laborers, I owned a majority share of the American market, demonstrating what great individuals can do with hard work and a detachment from empathy and other trivial emotions. I was truly a captain of industry. 

And the trains....OH THE TRAINS. Sleek, elegant, manful trains. Gliding across the tracks churning beautiful black smoke into the skies. Just thinking about my trains running through fields, across bridges, in and out of tunnels....I'm wet just thinking about it. |-|

I had been going through a fairly profound depression, after ending a very long relationship. Socially receding, not talking to anyone outside of work-related necessity, gaining weight, the whole nine. It was getting rough. I was slipping from what had been a well-adjusted normal lifestyle into gross neckbeardy filth.

A co-worker bugged me to play this game with him for a while until I finally gave in. I hadn't touched an MMO in years and, really, had no intention of ever getting back into it. I bought it, started playing, and immediately started making friends and feeling better. It was a good way of resocializing myself, and helped me break out of the nasty shell I was starting to develop.

It helps that the community is pretty stellar, too. Obligatory reference to /r/ffxiv |-|

(finally got rid of my Note 2, great idea, poorly executed) |-| 
|-| co90zuj || 11 || A Chromecast for every TV in the house. |-| 
|-| co8zgcq || 6 || A plane ticket to Brazil. I had an amazing time and met so many wonderful people. |-| 
|-| co90v59 || 6 || I bought a BitWhip from Antsonamelon.com...it's a flow,  dance,  rave toy.  Basically a six foot,  color changing fiver optic whip with 27 different modes.  Getting the flow down was tough,  but you can do some really cool stuff with it once you get it down and it requires virtually no skill to do so.  If you hate it,  your dog or cat will absolutely love it.. So its a win win either way.  |-|

|-| co90mif || 8 || Pokemon Alpha Sapphire. Hoenn is the shit. |-|

|-| co93hzc || 4 || I bought an Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 arcade cabinet.  The 10 year old me is very happy with this purchase. |-| 
|-| co94lrw || 4 || Gaming laptop. LANs at my friends place are so much easier now, and it does everything I need it to do on top of that.  |-|

|-| co99wjw || 4 || A smart phone.  Got a new old stock 4s and I love it.  Take a picture and email it to some one, you mean I don't have to hook a digital camera to my computer and hunt the picture and email.

Sold.  Hope to never go back.  Can't believe I waited so long to get one. |-| 
|-| co93ggy || 5 || Our new house!  Moved from a 360sqft studio condo for me, my wife, and our kitty, into a 1400 sqft 3 bedroom 2 bathroom 2 car garage house, bought a beautiful dining room and bedroom set, a brand new mattress, a kickass designer couch, some chairs, an elliptical machine, etc etc.  It's pretty awesome and we're stoked. |-|

|-| co98bpj || 3 || A Sodastream. My husband and I both drink tons of sparkling water, and I also drink diet soda. It's saved us so much money, and also seems far less wasteful, since recycling tons of cans and plastic bottles presumably uses up far, far more energy than whatever the energy cost for refilling one CO2 canister is. |-| 
|-| co9bpv5 || 3 || * I bought some sweatpants from Target for 95 cents. It was on sale for $6 and I have a $5 gift card and I saved an extra five cents for not using a plastic bag.

* I bought a new button down shirt from Macy's for $4 in October and redeemed some Citi Thank You points and bought a cast iron grill pan from Macys.
