|-| cnu3g1t || 3 || He's saying that deciding whether or not to act on an impulse implies freedom.

But every decision which isn't random has to be made by an evaluation of the available options,  made with reference to already-existing preferences. Therefore it isn't free. It is impossible to make a non-random choice without reference to pre-existing preferences, therefore every choice is a simple weighing-up exercise, with no freedom. |-|

|-| cnv4kdp || 62 || why are Heideggerians still becoming shocked and surprised by this stuff

"the Jews are world poor"

what did they expect?

shouldn't spend so much time on apologia and accept that it is what it is. Heidegger was a Nazi and even urged by Arendt he did not rescind. |-| 
|-| cnv7z0i || 19 || The black notebooks were not a big shock. I think that some of his work like the question concerning technology has some value even in spite of this though.

I always also liked an interview that Marcuse did with Friedrick Olafson (a Heidi scholar) where Marcuse tears Heidegger apart. He talks about how he visited Heidegger after the war and noted that the man was not really pensive about Nazism at all. He never did admit that he thought the Nazis did anything wrong.
I think its a must read if you are interested in this topic. |-| 
|-| cnv8ljh || 23 || Anybody else quietly horrified that unpopular opinions coming to light is going to make it very difficult to address anything Heidegger's written outside of "well that's Nazi philosophy" dismissals?

I feel like society is becoming increasingly self-censored and deeply uncomfortable with entertaining ideas they don't hold themselves. |-| 
|-| cnv8rav || 36 || Just because Heidegger was a Nazi, that doesn't mean his philosophy is wrong. Von Braun was a Nazi, that doesn't mean that rockets don't fly.

A bigger surprise would be if a guy from small-town Bavaria WASN'T a Jew hater. A lot of great people have thought and done WAY worse and we all politely sweep that under the carpet. |-| 
|-| cnv95d5 || 4 || It is always a challenge to separate a creator from their private political, moral and sociological leanings, however, should it be done? Does society discard the valuable insight or work they have provided if their other perspectives are offensive or don't align with the standard?

I am not defending Heidegger expressly, but I wonder - what if Einstein had been, not Jewish, but a member of the Nazi party? Would it undermine or invalidate the value of his formluae?

It's quite a conundrum. 

I suppose it might be different in the case of a philosopher like Heidegger, or Foucault because their ontological and critical examination may have colored our perspective implicitly and so we must be wary of their inherent biases, whereas Einstein's work in physics may be discrete from any such consideration...

|-| cnvfk75 || 3 || &gt;Heidegger had laid out the publishing schedule for his posthumous works, dictating that the Black Notebooks not be released until long after he was gone. Still, thousands of pages of documents in Heidegger’s archives are still closely guarded by his heirs, who refuse to release them.

Does anyone know what is going on with the publication of Heidegger's writings?  Why are these little notebooks being published when there are so many other (probably more substantive) things being withheld?  |-| 
|-| cnvge48 || 9 || Does anyone have a link to the actual Black Notebooks? There was one line quoted in that whole article and it didn't call for extermination so I'm curious as to what the context of these writings actually are. In cases like this, everyone should read it for themselves and make up their own minds, it's real easy nowadays for everyone to cut off thought and reasoned debate by shouting "Anti-semite, racist, and bigot".

EDIT: Wow. They're impossible to find. I'm googling the shit out of this and can't find where to even buy the full notebooks.  |-| 
|-| cnvj3hn || 3 || When it comes to Heidegger it's probably best to make a distinction between the actual person and their philosophy. TBH I'm surprised people don't.

Applies to all philosophers really (even Marx believed in common stereotypes about the Jews) but Heidegger especially, for this reason. |-| 
|-| cnvjuss || 3 || So the _chairperson of the Martin Heidegger Society_ wasn't at least aware of the contents of the Black Notebooks? |-| 
|-| cnvns8u || 3 || Why would Heidegger's personal views having any relevance to his philosophical views? Who cares if he hated Jews? Why does that matter when it comes down to discussing being, nothing, time, any metaphysics?

It's like you people don't understand ad hominem. Attack Heidegger's argument, not the fact that he doesn't like Jews.  |-| 
|-| cnvv9t1 || 7 || What is this supposedly common argument supposed to mean? I'm familiar with the brain in a vat quesion but what does (1) mean? I've never heard it before.

Also this article seems to simply be about vague language. If one were to say 'a brain in a vat has no hands' then an immediate question would be 'do you mean in the higher reality wherein the brain exists or do you mean in the reality which the brain perceives?' Then the article could be reduced to a few short paragraphs about using specific language.

Excuse me but I simply fail to see how this sort of semantic waffle has any benefit in cases like this. Before making an argument terms must be defined, it is silly to consider all possible meanings of a phrase when you can simply define them before continuing. Or perhaps someone could explain the value of such thinking.

Jokes aside, Malabou has this interesting (but difficult) book [The Future of Hegel](http://www.amazon.com/The-Future-Hegel-Plasticity-Temporality/dp/0415287219) where she tries to refute the Heideggerian (and French poststructuralist) accusation that Hegel was a philosopher of the past, without a future (both in the sense of being an antiquated philosopher, and of thinking that history had ended at his time, that no further change would happen). It's a worthy reading for anyone who thinks Hegel believed his philosophy and his time were the end of history. |-|

|-| cnxuj3u || 24 || Love Rapoport's stuff! 

Although it's kind of difficult to follow the rules when the opponent is an arrogant egocentric. I apply the "I see your point," "This is just my opinion," "I was wrong on this," "I'm not sure about that because I haven't researched it properly" - and these ultimately mean that I lose the debate, because the opponent isn't intelligent enough to understand how it works. 

"So there you go, if you were wrong about this, then you're definitely wrong about everything else." - this one is the most frustrating one. I don't even try to explain, those people are a lost cause in my eyes.  |-| 
|-| cnxxn41 || 7 || I think the secret to successful and most importantly worthwhile debate is coming into it with an attitude "I want my facts and beliefs to be disproven," rather than the other way around. Defend your beliefs and logic, but seek to find fault in them with the help of your opponent's critical thinking skills. 

But this would probably only work when the person you're debating comes into the game with the exact same attitude. |-|

Otherwise it is a pretty interesting read. What I do like about this conception of knowledge is that it subscribes to a 'floor gets more solid as time goes on' understanding of what it means to gather and accumulate knowledge. Inherently, that view is full of optimism and promise for future generations.

I do see a couple of flaws with this concept however, that I would like to see addressed. The first is the issue of visibility. We do not live in an ideal world where everyone knows what people would wish to publish. Often it is the case that luck rewards one person over many others with the opportunity to be read, and quoted, over and over. 

I am sure there are plenty of unknown papers full of genius lying around in universities where english is not the dominant language, and that are far from a power structure. It would be an interesting experiment for example, to dig into research done by people in provincial universities in places like Italy or Poland. Obviously, English is ever more widely spoken and written in, and the internet makes centralized institutions ever more obsolete. But the effect is still there, and I believe it can have a potentially huge effect on the way the marketplace of ideas works.

The second issue I have with this is the potential for unexamined bias. Sometimes, a shift in perspective does not change the knowledge gathered, but changes the framework in which it is understood so much that the knowledge itself becomes irrelevant. The example that jumps to my mind for this is the classification efforts of 19th century botanists and zoologists. With a modern understanding of genetics, these classifications are just plain wrong. However, they did prove useful up until the point where a previously unknown underpinning mechanism was exposed. EMH holds that such moments necessarily get rarer as time goes on, however knowledge is ever expanding, and I can easily imagine a fractal conception of it where shifts in paradigm occur with a certain regularity. 

In many ways, I find myself wary of nicely tied ideas like EHM, I worry that this type of theorising, much in the way that "The end of History" was for politics, is a way to reify the status quo. I do however find myself almost convinced. What do you guys think?

|-| co8vrgh || 5 || This is very, very good.  I'm used to reading critiques of "marketplace of ideas" conceptions, but you rarely ever see someone step up and take a swing at defending the EMH position even though many english speaking philosophers seem to tentatively assume it.

|-| cobozqk || 3 || This basically sums up the entire animal rights argument.

&gt;I would like to try to reduce the problem of the human treatment of non-human animals to a few basics that most of us can agree about. The first and most important one is that humans are animals too. The second is that all animals with nervous systems feel. They are not insensate lumps of matter. The third is that ethics and law  – what is right and wrong to do – are predicated on the existence of feeling: In an insensate world there would still be natural laws (laws of motion, gravity, electromagnetism) but no such thing as morality, or laws of conduct, or right or wrong, because if nothing feels, nothing matters.
  

He goes on to succinctly counter common objections:

1 . That we treat people badly too:

&gt;Now, although there is no suffering that we inflict on non-human animals that we do not inflict on humans, the vast difference is that the suffering we inflict on humans is seen as wrong by most decent people worldwide — and it is also against the law. Not so for animals. 

2 . That animals used for food are treated humanly
AND  
3 . That we need meat to survive.

(Links in paragraph after photo)

4 . Animals eat other animals.

&gt;So the survival needs of carnivores necessarily entail that they cause suffering to other feeling creatures, whereas the survival needs of herbivores do not.

&gt;What about our own species? We are omnivores, capable of thriving healthily on either a carnivorous or a purely herbivorous diet. Our ancestors no doubt ate meat, because they had to: there was not enough herbivorous fare for survival. But then we invented agriculture, and it became possible, in principle, to thrive, healthily, on purely herbivorous fare. However, we have not yet taken that route, and the question is why?

|-| cogn1ts || 15 || If I were a high school student, I'd be scrolling down to the comments to see how people respond to something like this:

Advantages

1. Getting 6 hours of college credit for $150 or less is a steal.

2. Starting off with philosophy will give you tools that will help you in your other college courses (regardless of major).

3. This can help you get a head start on your degree, or can just lighten up a couple semesters.

Disadvantages

1. Online courses require more self-motivation than physical classrooms.

2. Philosophy is conversational - the classroom dynamic can make the subject more engaging.

3. Taking a philosophy course may convince you that you need a philosophy degree, as it did for me.

|-| cognwhq || 11 || Short response, Kant applies equally well to fiction/fantasy as he does to reality. You can, with a little squeezing, get the major points of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason from Aristotle's *Poetics* if you simply write of Aristotle's argument that it's strange that people accept narratives on the basis of its fidelity to first causes and the appearance of necessary effects that follow.

&gt; reality without logically deducing, empirically experiencing, or appealing to authoritative testimony. 

All three of these exist in 'quality' fiction. Take Kant, replace 'reality' with fantasy (ala either Lacan, Marx, or Foucault's account of how reality appears to us as a kind of fantasy/ideology/discursive structure) and you still have the structures of mind that utilize reason in a forwards and backwards manner with scrutiny and impetus towards first cause and lackadaisical care for following any cause and effect chain indefinitely. 

The point is not that fiction stands up to impossibly logical scrutiny, it's that they stand up to enough scrutiny to convince people to participate in and fantasize about a world that appears to be ordered without contradiction--be it stretching deductive reasoning, re-authoring canon (Star Wars and Star Trek), or appeals to director/writer/show-runner testimony.

The fact that many people desire to fill the gaps in fictional narratives is more telling of how individuals really relate to reality and 'truth' than any philosophy which demands rationality as a guide by which to organize human behavior and thinking.

Or, as Zizek says in Pervert's Guide to Ideology:

&gt;Our fundamental delusion today is not to believe in what is only a fiction, to take fictions too seriously. It's, on the contrary, not to take fictions seriously enough. You think it's just a game? It's reality. It's more real than it appears to you. For example, people who play video games, they adopt a screen persona of a sadist, rapist, whatever. The idea is, in reality I'm a weak person, so in order to supplement my real life weakness, I adopt the false image of a strong, sexually promiscuous person, and so on and so on. So this would be the naïve reading... But what if we read it in the opposite way? That this strong, brutal rapist, whatever, identity is my true self. In the sense that this is the psychic truth of myself and that in real life, because of social constraints and so on, I'm not able to enact it. So that, precisely because I think it's only a game, it's only a persona, a self-image I adopt in virtual space, I can be there much more truthful. I can enact there an identity which is much closer to my true self.

|-| cogosft || 4 || Is your question about fiction itself or the useage of it? All fiction describes something about human nature, it's one of the best ways to understand human beings and how we work. The effects of fiction also are external/objective ones.  |-| 
|-| cogqx3a || 3 || Well, your conclusion is more accurately that audiences cannot come to know anything about solutions to "what if?" questions from fictions absent real life experience or logical deduction... and not that fiction cannot convey information about the external world, but that the reader cannot confidently draw external information from fiction in isolation. To that, I'm inclined to say duh. Further, I'm inclined to point out that scientific articles are equally useless absent logical deduction, real-life experience, outside comparisons, etc., i.e., when considered in such an irrationally isolated sense. Also, your suggestion that fiction mandates unrealistic events seems to reflect your preference for science fiction more than it refllects the actual limitations of fiction. |-| 
|-| cogwxd3 || 4 || &gt;... to properly make all of the objects in a fictional narrative correspond properly to real laws ... an exhaustively comprehensive knowledge of those laws is required.

I don't see any necessity for this kind of flawless knowledge. 

You admit that when the author doesn't specify the laws, our everyday laws apply. So the less things are specified, the closer it has to adhere to reality. It looks to me that when our intuitions automatically fill in the blanks with 'reality', there has to be some intuitive knowledge present in fiction. Thus in principle a what-if-question should be answerable. Your claim looks to be way too strong.

Besides, this kind of flawless knowledge of laws isn't necessary at all in our daily lives. Yet you either completely allow what-if-questions there, or never at all. This doesn't sit right with me either. I think the flaw is in the quote I gave; that in order to be able to ask what-if-questions a complete description of reality is needed. Who is ever going to agree with you on that? |-|
