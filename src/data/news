|-| cntuhai || 826 || I get a blank page when I try to read the article (unless I answer their dumb survey or something).  From View Source:

Montana officials said Sunday that an oil pipeline breach spilled up to 50,000 gallons of oil into the Yellowstone River near Glendive, but they said they are unaware of any threats to public safety or health.

The Bridger Pipeline Co. said the spill occurred about 10 a.m. Saturday. The initial estimate is that 300 to 1,200 barrels of oil spilled, the company said in a statement Sunday.

Some of the oil did get into the water, but the area where it spilled was frozen over and that could help reduce the impact, said Dave Parker, a spokesman for Gov. Steve Bullock.  “We think it was caught pretty quick, and it was shut down,” Parker said. “The governor is committed to making sure the river is cleaned up.”

Bridger Pipeline Co. said in the statement that it shut down the 10-inch-wide pipeline shortly before 11 a.m. Saturday. “Our primary concern is to minimize the environmental impact of the release and keep our responders safe as we clean up from this unfortunate incident,” said Tad True, vice president of Bridger.

The EPA and state Department of Environmental Quality have responded to the area about 9 miles upriver from Glendive, Parker said.  An ExxonMobil Corp. pipeline broke near Laurel during flooding in July 2011, releasing 63,000 gallons of oil that washed up along an 85-mile stretch of riverbank.  Montana officials are trying to determine if oil could have been trapped by sediment and debris and settled into the riverbed.

ExxonMobil is facing state and federal fines of up to $3.4 million from the spill. The company has said it spent $135 million on the cleanup and other work.  Montana and federal officials notified Exxon that they intend to seek damages for injuries to birds, fish and other natural resources from the 2011 spill. The company also is being asked to pay for long-term environmental studies and for lost opportunities for fishing and recreation during and since the cleanup. |-|

You're not seeing this because it's news, you're seeing it because someone important wants you to be afraid of oil pipelines. |-| 
|-| cntutew || 131 || For anyone interested in a reference point for the amount: 50,000 gallons is about the equivalent of 6 large double-axle tanker truck trailers.  Some of the biggest have 3 axles and carry around 10,000 gallons bringing the number closer to 5 trailers, but i don't see many of them and see way more of the double axle carriers.

Additionally, according to [this site](http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/horses/facts/info_digest.htm) the stomach of a large horse is around 15L.  It would take 12,618 horses to drink up the volume of oil that was spilled.  I'm pretty sure this would kill the horses.  So now you have 12,618 crude-filled dead horses in the Yellowstone River. Which, now that I think about it, is probably worse.

Edit: because I'm getting PMs now... I'm not intending to make this seem a more or less than it really is. Simply comparing the amount to something I see a lot of on a daily basis. Goddamn must everything be picked apart as having some ulterior motive? Also, the horse part was sort of a joke, ya know. |-|

Think about it. The rich, powerful, and healthy will only get better and better while the rest will become worse and worse. Scientists will stop trying to find cures and treatments for physical/mental ailments and instead focus their energies on creating perfect, healthy, "desirable" babies. This will leave the rest of the humans to suffer alone. People with physical disabilities will become even more ostracized, people with mental health issues will be further stigmatized and locked away...essentially, flawed humans will not be seen as valuable or desirable. Their lives will be viewed as worthless. Then we'll start seeing hate crimes against the "less valuable" people, and we may even see genocide eventually. |-|

Basically, it's taking away the independence or the ability to make one's own life choices from an eventual adult. So here's the thing: what if we allow people to design their kid, but then they get appointed a random genetically modified kid, while theirs is given to some other parents. Genetic lottery, like we say. Since you can't claim genetic similarity as the reason it's your kid (you had its genome modified) this is equally good and it will force the parents to deal with a kid that's a different person in itself. |-| 
|-| cntw65a || 29 || As an engineer, the first thing I think is how does a pipeline not have more technology implemented into a sensor/feedback system.  I would assume they would have volumetric flow meters or pressure sensors at given increments that could almost instantaneously detect an issue and therefore close off an automated valve, stopping flow.  It's not even that difficult of a system.  

If they had valves every 500 ft with an instant feedback system, then the most that would spill is around 2000 gal (the total oil volume in the 500ft of 10" pipe).

When I got to the front there was a group of employees and supervisors standing around.  Some guys were heading back to their cars.

Turns out...two employees had been caught stealing jewelry from packages some years before I worked there.  They were detained and turned over to the police.  

The employees turned around and sued UPS.  Seems their civil rights were violated when they were detained by UPS.  They won their suit and got a multi-million dollar judgement.

Of course, UPS's lawyers appealed.  However, financially they didn't meet the courts requirement (putting up a bond or making a deposit or something /I'm not a lawyer).  So, the two guys lawyers had the sheriff out to seize UPS assets to cover the judgement!

I can't remember how long it took UPS's lawyers to fix it situation but I know I didn't work that day. |-|

Most likely the initial estimate is so wide because as soon as they noticed a pressure drop they shut it down. This wouldn't have provided much time to get a good sampling from the ultrasonic of what's coming in from upstream to compare to what's going out downstream, particularly because any breach followed by a full stop shutdown like this would have caused a lot of fluctuation making the data spotty and unreliable at best. While some people are optimistic that it may not have been running at full capacity, i'm a bit more hesitant since we're in the thick of winter when oil is (usually) at its high point and oil storage fields would be doing the most trading (if it's anything like the natural gas market).

**Now**, that unholy propaganda machine has edited clips to make protesters seem bloodthirsty (twice) and is spreading lies about the muslim community. I cant consume any Fox related media (legally) without feeling sick to my stomach. The whole brand has been soiled by this bullshit. |-|

|-| cnu4gbn || 6 || How to **really** evaluate this scenario:

An exploited and disenfranchised member of the working class delivers a pizza-service to equally exploited and disenfranchised working class people and in so doing inadvertently leads to a misunderstanding about **who can lick the bread crumbs off the plate**.

The receivers of the service feels, erroneously, that he is of higher status and expresses his regrets for having paid a civilized tip amount.  He wants those crumbs back.  

Meanwhile, the coworkers at this typical locus of exploitation, the Car Dealership, pile on insults to the Pizza-service guy as putting someone else down generates a reciprocal (false) feeling of superiority.  There is also a brief (sick) moment of a sense of solidarity, too, as all the anger and frustrations find a way to be vented as a "team".

Both the Pizza-service guy and the sales people/staff are in the same boat, living lives they have little to no democratic control over, subject to the whims and greed of distant oligarchs but they cannot bring themselves to acknowledge this reality and to face the futility and debasement of their collective circumstance. True teamwork on a class level eludes them as their ambition is to climb over the bodies of their fellow wage-slaves rather than unite to find true solidarity and collective power.

It is only in seeing this immorality play and its characters from a distance that other members of the working class find it gratifying to pay forward some recompense to the "victim".  Yet they all are victims.  The deliverer of the pizza-service, the customer-staff at the dealership as well as the folks of mostly working class back grounds that put forward the $11000 are all cheated and exploited.  

The statistics show that wealth inequality will reach a point in 2016 where the top 1% will control 99% of the wealth.

What kind of a society and economic system is it that would leave 99% of the people fighting over 1%?  What system can be called "good" that leads to the mass of people who's hard work generated the wealth only being given the crumbs off the plate?

So what was purchased for that generous giving once this video was put online?  The donations provided a false sense of righting a wrong and expressed the hope that in a similar circumstance, members of the working class will help each other out.  That is hopeful.

How do we end this miserable cycle in the first place?  How do we provide a dignified life to all the working people so that they, in turn, treat each other with the kindness and dignity a first class society should expect?

It all starts with asking the question, "how?".  Until we get to asking that, we will remain lost in our current spiral to the bottom.

Edit: Correction  

http://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/Wealth_Having_it_all_and_wanting_more.pdf

It appears that the Top 1% will control as much wealth as the bottom 99% by 2016, which Ferinex correctly points out is 1% owning 50% of all the wealth.  Thanks Ferinex, it is all very grim but not yet as obscene as I had at first thought. |-|

|-| cnu4vuw || 3 || this is probably already posted or maybe irrelevant...but  i dug around and the parent company for Bridger Pipeline LLC is called True Companies (http://www.truecos.com). 

the pipeline system they operate is fairly large, covering parts of ND, MT, WY (there are maps on the website, and that is only for this branch company). looks like they also own and operate feedlots/huge farms (found under true ranches llc) (http://truecompanies.truecos.com/Ranches/default.htm) as well as drilling and a myriad of other oil pipeline &amp; trucking companies. 

i know this isn't a large spill in retrospect and people are allowed and encouraged to capitalize, but it just makes me wonder….seems like a conflict of interest. furthermore they have expanded business into fields that are both horrible for the environment, and directly reliant on each other for success. i know thats smart business, but it also encourages monopolization, and keeps the name True Companies fairly separated from this incident.also they operate in beautiful parts of this country that need to be protected. 

also I'm ignorant to how fines for spills go but would the parent company be fined as well?

|-| cnucru7 || 6 || What kind of communities are they putting the homeless in?

Are they in established communities?

Is it dropping the current value of the other homes in the neighborhood?

If its in lower income places, and minimally to not at all affecting home prices negatively, then great!

But how can all of you who think you are being sarcastically funny with the OMGZWUTACONCEPT! thing think its ok if middle class citizens who probably have the majority of their equity in their home lose that equity due to helping the homeless?  

I think almost everyone would agree that asking someone who makes $50k/year to give $50k to a homeless person to help them not be homeless is a stupid idea as no one should have to do that.

So, what is the difference if someone's $200,000 home drops to $150,000 because a few of the houses in the neighborhood are part of this program?

I understand AND agree the need to help the destitute and the needy.  Of course we as humans should care and do what we can, but some of you act like you can just give houses to every homeless person and there will be no fallout.  It isn't as easy as that.  There has to be some kind of back and forth that helps the homeless but doesn't affect other's lives negatively to that kind of extent.  

To be fair, I haven't looked into the program, so maybe they are all putting the homeless in abandoned developments, and that is fine... for the short time, but without proper medical care and medication, those developments will just turn into ghettos.  

I sort of think it would behoove the homeless more to have camps that they can go to, have a room, have medical and therapist access, a place to learn or re-learn basic skills and what not.  Gradually give people responsibilities in the camp and then when they feel they can go out on their own, they have experience and work history.  If things fall apart they can all come back... But whenever I suggest anything like this, people just focus on the word "camp" and all of a sudden I'm Hitler and evil for suggesting that the homeless be shunned from everyone else.

Those who support it say that "It prevents disease". Bull-fucking-shit! Just wash it when it's appropriate!  These people who's culture &amp; practices support this ***cutting*** say that their "God" is okay with this.  Then the question is why would *any* God put on those parts on in the first place!? 

There have been some psychology papers being presented which are "pointing" toward male domestic violence upon: 

* females
* animals
* children
* other males 

This is due "in-part" (i.e. I'm saying it at least contributes towards) these destructive behaviors because these baby boys had suffered this extreme &amp; very traumatic event just right after they're born into this world. 

Think about it... after nine month in their mother's womb, being ***cared for with love &amp; kindness***, that they're subjected to the worst type of blood-letting anyone could fathom!  Just Google "the screams of little boys being circumcised" is enough to make any adult cry. 

Sickening &amp; disgusting!  The old stone-age/bronze-age way of thinking has got to go! Stop the insanity now, before we're all forced to one day obey this stupid laws because ***"somebody's culture/practice"*** says so.  |-|

|-| cnunmlu || 4 || Something people need to understand is that marijuana legalization is bad for most people in government positions.  It's good for the people because we get reduced crime, easier access to a medicine that for many is more effective than prescription drugs, and far less paranoia about being a user.  There's also the job creation.

To government, the only upside to marijuana legalization is tax revenue.  Which may or may not be equivalent to what they generate for having a war on marijuana.  They don't get to use it as leverage on people they want to hit for bigger crimes.  They don't get to fill quotas as easily.  They don't get to lock up casual users as marijuana addicts and charge them or their loved ones for recovery programs.  So it creates jobs for the people but threatens those of established government agencies.  Overall marijuana being illegal is good for their livelihood and job security, which is why I thought it was so weird to see it get legalized.  They've crafted a system that's partially reliant on marijuana being demonized.  I really don't expect the current freedom of use in some states to last.

It might sound like conspiracy but it's just the way things work.  Government agencies and the people are two entirely different entities with different laws required for survival.  I just do not see this lasting.  It's a reality that is far too good to be true. |-|

I mean, in terms of sheer "our children!" alone, Colorado has millions of dollars going to public education that prior to legalization simply didn't exist. Underage drug use and crime overall continues to decline in Colorado. There's going to a be a tipping point when the anti-legalization people start to realize that "oh... it had pretty much zero effect on everyone, didn't increase crime, didn't turn our children into drug addicts, *and* it helped fund public schools, among other programs" To say nothing of the money that taxpayers saved by no longer prosecuting, punishing, and potentially imprisoning people.

Oh, also, we have a brand new expanding industry that is providing jobs to people from the cashiers to farmers to the people that harvest--minimum/minimal wage jobs and blue collar, good old American agriculture jobs.

With Oregon and Alaska having legalized, we're going to see a tipping point spurring legalization in states even faster than we saw from the first medicinal state to the majority. |-|

A hospital takes a LOT of water to run so it hit us quick, and before I knew of the oil spill I could smell something - but I thought it was our stainless steel polish and that some idiot must have tried to clean a sink with it. Didnt think anything of it until finding out right before bed.  This AM, it was completely unusable, it reeked of crude oil from our faucets....but city still said OK to drink.

We turned off our coffee and soda machines before lunch, and many people were confused, as the city still broadcasted water was OK to drink. It wasn't until after supper this evening that we finally received word in preliminary testing it "contained hydrocarbons"....but they could not let us know anything else until tomorrow. It's so bad we were advised not to run our dishwasher, and what good will the three compartment sink do if you rinse your dishes in water that's contaminated??? We are using bottled for food and drink, because we have no idea what will be done and how soon. 

Besides telling people it was OK without gathering all the facts first, no one has exactly been straightforward throughout all of this. I understand not wanting to cause panic, but this river is the city's source of water, wouldn't precautionary measures be more appropriate after something like this happens? Ugh. |-| 
|-| cnup9kr || 3 || Did Pot originally become prohibited because people thought it would could crime? I thought that argument was for drugs like Crack-Cocaine. Pretty certain those who originally prohibited pot did so because pot was seen to make people lax / less motivated, which was ultimately seen as bad for productivity. 

I think in a place like the U.S, productivity is heavily tied to income anyway. So whether it is true or not, it should be each persons individual choice. Yet still, I am curious about seeing the effects of it on productivity. The only problem is, that kind of trend is really difficult to look at (lot of noise from other influences and factors). And also, we would need long term data since most studies don't really find anything interesting regarding pot from short-term use, but do when looking at long-term. |-|

|-| cnuv9dm || 8 || Construction Superintendent, and former demolition foreman here.  I have taken down bridges in similar situations, and thought I would provide you all with a little background on what was happening, from what I can glean from the article, anyway:

Structures are weakened prior to full removal, and that is what was happening here.  The excavator was most likely weakening the concrete deck, or more likely working to remove the concrete completely.  The steel beams should have been more than sufficient to support the work...they would have been removing load, after all...as they took concrete off of it.  

If I were doing this job, that is exactly how I would approach it: remove the concrete deck, then take down the beams one by one.  It is the most controlled method for removal, considering it is over an active road.  If the road were closed...then yes, a much different, more direct approach would have been utilized.  

[Take a close look at the ends of the remaining beams in this picture.](http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2b88a232c7f5365e5f6d85e1893b0ed159b20c53/c=175-0-1276-828&amp;r=x513&amp;c=680x510/local/-/media/2015/01/20/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635573151464366738-VIADUCT-COLLAPSE-5.jpg) 

~~They do not appear to have been worked on...they are twisted slightly, but there are no torch marks, which would provide evidence that the steel was intentionally weakened.  That is very curious.  I cannot see any other evidence that the steel was somehow modified.~~

Without knowing the specifics of this bridges construction, I have to wonder if the contractor inadvertently weakened steel components during the concrete removal process.

My best guess is that the concrete deck and steel components were more integral than is standard, intentionally or otherwise, and either the contractor or the engineers were unaware of it.  The cause of this accident could very well go all the way back to a faulty original design or faulty construction.  

EDIT2:  My previous edit was stupid, so I removed it...they were working on the other end, as I saw from examining more of the pictures.  This changes my opinion somewhat though...it is possible that as they removed the load from the one end of the bridge, it removed the cantilever weight...and not unlike a see-saw, the working end rose in the air allowing the rest of the bridge to fall.  The positions of the loose beams supports that theory...as if they were thrown around by the force of the bridge falling.  

I'm now betting that there was a 'moment' connection that failed, causing this collapse.

|-| cnuy5r8 || -27 || Before anyone derps out about the protest, you need to know that Seattle PD has a very bad reputation and a history of violence against civilians. The Justice Department even did an investigation of SPD and ruled that "[SPD has engaged in a pattern or practice of excessive force that violates the Constitution and federal law](http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/seattlepd.php)."

Edit: Wow, assholes, I said **derp** about protest, I didn't say anything about legitimate criticisms. I didn't escuse their behavior, and they shouldn't have shut down the freeway. I'm saying that people shouldn't be saying the protesters are just whining about not getting the presents they want. These people have a real reason to be protesting. I'm not agreeing with their methodology, I'm just asking that people try keep a level head about the situation and not go full retard bashing their motives instead of criticizing their methods. But I guess that's too much to ask. 

Edit 2: Here's another example of the Derp I was hoping to avoid. "Those people stuck in traffic were held hostage against their will." No, they were stuck in traffic. |-|

Edit: laws already in the works to increase penalties including $5000 fine instead of just $50 and being charged with manslaughter or attempted murder in the event of accidents.

If anything, they are so fuel-inefficient, slow, and unwieldy that the procurement of MRAPs by police forces would limit their use.

Considering that the items people have the most problems with are the free rifles (the opposition to which is dumb, especially in Tennessee) and armored vehicles (which, again, have existed in police arsenals for almost a century) and the rifles are exempted, does the person proposing this bill have an interest in, or know anyone who has an interest in, companies that produce armored vehicles suitable for police use whose business has been harmed by the program? |-|

Need to add more to this. If regular officers feel they can not handle the situation are there not units like swat teams that are trained more for the kind of trouble that needs the military gear?

I know that happens everywhere, but there is something about Ohio that gives these kinds of people undue influence on the state level and a megaphone for their intolerance.

2) I don't think that all police should be prohibited from having/using all of this military equipment.  It makes sense to have highly trained, very specialized police use some of this gear for the most extreme situations.  The problem comes when normal officers, who don't have time to train thoroughly either with this equipment or on specialized tactics, use MRAPS and similar gear when busting some low level pot dealer in his mom's house as a run-of-the-mill operation.  

There are times when we want domestic law enforcement to be able to quickly respond, using specialized officers to extreme situations quickly and have the equipment to deal with very dangerous situations.   What we don't want is normal community policing officers having this gear available for stuff like protests when they clearly aren't trained adequately with the gear, let alone dealing with crowds. |-|

|-| cnv8tny || 151 || Can't say I agree with the hive here. It's the greater issues that this singular story brings up. How we feel about pardons as a society. We know people change, we see it over the years in those around us. Yet, if someone is convicted of a crime there's this cloud over the concept of change as if that person is now incapable to be a better person and learn from their mistakes. Pardons for a typical person are not easy to obtain, they take a lot of effort and hoops to jump through. If someone has shown they've changed and they're working to improve themselves I think it's destructive to our society to so quickly dismiss the individual. 

As for the Wahlberg case what I find interesting is the knee-jerk reaction he's undeserving because he's an actor, rich, white, he doesn't "need" it. What I think should cause some pause is the fact that he was only 16 when he committed his crimes. If all of us were judged based on the 16 year old version of ourselves I think a fair amount of people wouldn't look too good. 

This comes again to change. I think without a question who we are at 16 years old developmentally at 30 or 40 is so vastly different it seems crazy to think that it's impossible that Wahlberg couldn't have possibly grown up in that span of time and is genuinely a different person today than he was 26 years ago. Maybe he doesn't deserve a pardon. But I do think he deserves fair consideration like anyone else should have in the courts.

|-| cnv8u3d || 48 || Wahlberg has not apologized the victims.  His 'admission of guilt' is actually an evasion.  Wahlberg seems to think he was arrested and sent to prison for using drugs and alcohol, for which he is very sorry.  So what, that's not what he was charged with.  The time he spent in prison was for repeated racist attacks.  Does he not support racist attacks anymore?  He doesn't say that.  His time in jail gave him 'street cred' with the Gay model underwear crowd he was famous for when he was young.

Lets face it, we have some serious military surplus here in the USA, hell, why not give it to the police? Because officers aren't properly trained in their use? Because APCs tear up our roads? Because it would be like shooting fish in a barrel... with a bazooka?

None of that matters compared to the bottom line, they got'em so might as well get your money's worth. Selling them to get rid of them is cute, but unlikely. Destroying them, as this article suggests, would practically bring some Americans to tears, and I would not be surprised to see protests coming out against their dismantling.

It makes perfect sense, does not disrupt my daily routines (And by that I of course mean officers that would be affected as a whole) and does not make any ridiculous or uninformed decisions. For example it does not call a carbine an assault rifle, and try to ban it because the military uses it. I agree that all the materials mentioned in the PDF have no place and frankly *no need* in police scenarios. If they are needed, the national guard should probably be deployed. 

I hope that more follow this path, with *sensible* bills that are based on informed and proper decision-making and information. It's important that these get passed, but even more important that they are based in actual facts and not the fictions of gun-hating or scared senators or others.

The customer service is horrendous. When I ordered my cable to be hooked up they didn't have to come to the house but for some reason they never put the order in to start the service. They did however start the billing right away. After several phone calls later and being hung up on by a manager I found out that I had to wait another 5 days for some reason. 
When they did hook it up and turn it on they never called to let me know. I kept checking but do to a technical problem on their end they still were't providing me service. So I called them back again and the lady on the other end spent an hour trying to figure out what was wrong. Even though I was reading her the MAC address off the back of the device she insisted I was reading her the wrong number. When I said that I used to work in IT and I know what I was talking about she said "clearly you do not". It turns out that there was another problem on their end. Of course no apology. Horrible horrible service. This was in July of this year. 
They also said they would give me the cheaper introductory rate but when I got the bill they had given me the higher non discount rate. The list of problems I had with them in one week was amazing.  |-|

But it's hard to want to pursue this career when everyone and their mother seems to hate the people that protect them. As any police officer will tell you, no one wants to be rid of a bad officer more than a good one and bad ones are in the 1%. Bills like this are meant to take power away from the police department. I get that people feel threatened by the fact police have access to this type of equipment, but it makes no sense to take it away from them. The key word here is access. A patrol cop isn't running around with an M4 at all times, nor does he have full tactical gear on in his cruiser. These things the police departments have are for "what if" situations. I just don't understand why taking away equipment that helps them do their job more efficiently help anyone? It just doesn't make sense to me. |-|

Take a small drink of beer whenever the following things occur:

- Obama says the words "middle class"
- John Boenher smirks or rolls his eyes in the background
- The camera cuts to an especially disgruntled Republican
- Obama mentions the cost of healthcare or college tuition

Take a generous gulp of beer if the following things happen:

- Bipartisan applause
- Obama mentions police-community relations, immigration, or the space program
- Anecdotal story about one person's experience (finish the beer if the person is in the military and/or from a swing state)

Take a shot of tequila if:

- There is an outburst from the audience (two shots if the outburst is from Biden or Boehner)
- The camera shows someone crying
- Obama mentions the value of freedom of speech
- Obama mentions a manned mission to Mars
- Anyone has a wardrobe malfunction or embarrassing hot-mic incident |-|

Check me if I am wrong but he was shot with a pistol. Then during the riots cop showed up with gear and vehicles to keep them safe and somehow that was wrong. It reminds me of the Zimmerman trial when everybody was screaming about stand your ground when it was not a stand your ground case. So now the answer is to put cops at a disadvantage. I have a friend who is cop in memphis which is a hell hole and they encounter bad guys with military weapons all the time but this bill would only disarm the cops.  |-|

In fact, this legislation lowers the bar from "probable cause" to "reasonable suspicion"...not of a cop, and not just of a teacher, but, according to the statute, ***cafeteria workers and custodians!!!!***

So, any fucking yokel who lucked into a job at a school (teachers *very* much included in this) now has police power to detain a student and conduct a search of their electronic devices and social media accounts without a warrant, and only needs to present "reasonable suspicion" (originally intended to let experienced police officers detain people based on their expertise in profiling criminal activity) to do so...and *children* will now be found to *violate state law* if they simply *refuse a warrantless search*.

"Yes." 

End of story. We know from *United States v. Alvarez* that lying about armed forces service is protected speech, so there's no infraction there, and after that, where's it gonna go? Does the parking lot attendant or owner-operator of the business serviced by a public parking lot now have police power to compel me to produce military ID?

|-| cnvooww || 3 || Hey Reddit. 

Fuck you.

No seriously, fuck you.

Every single Michael Brown thread I had to wade through racist bullshit on how he deserved because he had shoplifted (never convicted though.) And how that cop could notnpoasibly have lied even though the prosecutor has since admitted one of his witnesses committed perjury in favor of the cop, oh and the autopsy reports go both ways but whatever.

But here in this thread? Nothing but understanding for Wahlberg. "He served his time!" "He was only a teenager!" Oh yeah? And how fucking old was Brown? I guess he was an old man, right? Do you ignorant fucks know how much "time" Wahlberg actually served for beating two Asian men and **permanently blinding one** of them in one of the eyes? 45 fucking days. He got 2 years and got out in 45 days.

In subsequent interviews, his "apologies" have amounted to "oh I did some things I regret but I took my punishment for it." You fucking blinded someone with no goddamn provocation at all while screaming racial slurs at him and served 45 fucking days. You didn't pay your debt you stupid cunt. He doesn't even have the common fucking decency to give a real apology. 

But that's okay, because reddit is very understanding. You, Mr poor disenfranchised millionaire actor, you need a pardon so you can get your liquor license. Yes. Poor Marky Mark.

Reddit really fucking sucks sometimes. |-|

Out of curiosity I went and looked. And saw this: "Ernst is a lieutenant colonel in the logistics branch and currently commands the 185th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion at Camp Dodge, the largest battalion in the Iowa Army National Guard.[11][12] As of 2014, Ernst had served 21 years between the Army Reserve and the National Guard. She spent 14 months in Kuwait in 2003-2004 as a company commander during Operation Iraqi Freedom.[9][13][14]"

&gt; According to the sentencing memorandum, he confronted Thanh Lam, a Vietnamese man, as he was getting out of his car with two cases of beer. Wahlberg called Lam a "Vietnam f------ s---" and beat him over the head with a 5-foot wooden stick until Lam lost consciousness and the rod broke in two.

&gt;Documents say **Wahlberg ran up to another Vietnamese man, Hoa Trinh, and asked for help hiding. After a police cruiser drove past, he punched Trinh in the eye.** Later, he made crude remarks about Asians.

After someone gave him help, he then turned around and punched him. This guy should have rot in jail. |-|

I've never had the issue with we will be here between the time of 6am to 5pm its always been between and hour like 2pm to 3pm and most often than anything they call me and tell me they can be even earlier if I home.

It's still a person's body, what's the difference? We have such a double standard in this country. (This in no way reflects my views on abortion, just making a comparison based on a common, related argument)

|-| cnvuhqx || 3 || "The legislation requires that:
-- The medication is self-administered.
-- The patient is mentally competent to make health care decisions, which excludes dementia patients.
-- Two physicians confirm a prognosis of six months or less to live.
-- The attending physician discusses alternatives or additional treatment, such as pain control and palliative and hospice care.
-- A written and two oral requests must be made at least 15 days apart.
-- Two witnesses attest to the request."

These stipulations are very important because it somewhat relieves the physician of their ethical duty to do no harm. Also, it accounts for the issue of who should be allowed this right. It would not be good if 15 yr olds fresh off their first break ups are allowed to sign up to die. 

Anyways most of the comments seem to favor right to die by bashing on religious counter arguments. My biggest concern regarding right to die is a nonreligious one. Right to die creates the possibility where a dying patient may feel like a burden, and they may choose to die so their family can stop paying expensive medical bills. That sounds honorable, but their choice might be out of guilt about extending their life at their family's expense, and no one should be guilted into dying. Not to mention, some evil family members might even try to convince them into dying early so they can save on money. We don't live in an ideal world so these things would happen. Overall though, I think we should have the right to die under the conditions quoted above, and we should try to make sure these patients die with dignity.  |-|

But what I don't agree with is how some people are defending Wahlberg, how he shouldn't be liable for the stupid things he has done when he was 16. Picking up a large wooden stick and hitting it over a man's head hard enough that he was knocked unconscious when you are 16 is not stupid. Car surfing is stupid, purposely peeing in the school hallway is stupid. That was not stupid, it was a legitimate crime. He had a hard life and he did the time for it, but these were unprovoked attacks.

Don't downplay his actions. If we don't downplay teens dumping urine, feces etc. onto an individual with autism, why are we downplaying attempted murder? |-|

|-| cnxcfvy || 4 || Guys, no one is trying to take away your warrants to conduct no-knock raids.  We're just trying to make sure you're only doing them when you have evidence of the home-owner doing something illegal on his or her property and that you have reason for entering the house unannounced instead of after presenting your warrant.  

If that's still a problem, then there's another issue.   |-| 
|-| cnxchko || 27 || Manufacturers don't just raise prices anymore.  That I don't have a problem with.  What pisses me completely off is this shit:

- Granola bar costs $2.50/box
- They go on sale for $2.00
- Wait a second, these are 25% smaller than they used to be
- 2 weeks later, sale ends.  You're now paying $2.50 for a smaller product

Just raise the freaking price in the first place.

Chiefs fans' broke Seahawks' fans' record of having the loudest outdoor stadium by creating 142.2 decibels worth of noise at Arrowhead Stadium.

&gt;"In both cases, it is the explicit, unmistakable, offensive message that the bakers are asked to put on the cake that gives rise to the bakers' free speech right to refuse," administrative law judge Robert N. Spencer said.

So basically they always have to make the cake, they can just choose not to decorate it? Am I interpreting that correctly? |-|

I'd be inclined to say that he would have to make the sign. Free speech is protected in the Constitution, while the right to refuse service has been limited by court cases.

I don't care if someone is skiing down a mountain of cocaine in their back yard, in a free and just society police need a warrant, and they need to knock on the door, during the day, and announce who they are.

But if it were up to me no one would ever be arrested for drugs. Drugs are a health issue, not a criminal one. Violence and theft are crimes. Choosing to put a substance in YOUR OWN BODY is not. |-|

|-| cnxdytb || 296 || I know I'm reposting but more people need to read/see this:

&gt;The officers with SWAT and dynamic-entry experience interviewed for this book say raids are orders of magnitude more intoxicating than anything else in police work. Ironically, many cops describe them with language usually used to describe the drugs the raids are conducted to confiscate. “Oh, it’s a huge rush,” Franklin says. 

&gt;“Those times when you do have to kick down a door, it’s just a big shot of adrenaline.” Downing agrees. “It’s a rush. And you have to be careful, because the raids themselves can be habit-forming.” Jamie Haase, a former special agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement who went on multiple narcotics, money laundering, and human trafficking raids, says the thrill of the raid may factor into why narcotics cops just don’t consider less volatile means of serving search warrants.

&gt;**“The thing is, it’s so much safer to wait the suspect out,” he says. “Waiting people out is just so much better. You’ve done your investigation, so you know their routine. So you wait until the guy leaves, and you do a routine traffic stop and you arrest him. That’s the safest way to do it. But you have to understand that a lot of these cops are meatheads. They think this stuff is cool. And they get hooked on that jolt of energy they get during a raid.”** - Radley Balko,  *Rise of the Warrior Cop* |-|

|-| cnxe3cd || 4 || How 'bout not making yourself a justifiable homicide and killing people for acting on that? The amount of innocent people killed for simply defending their property kind of proves getting a no-knock warrant isn't too hard.

This either-or mentality is ridiculous.

It's not about privacy, it's about safety of occupants and police.

Destroying evidence is mainly about drugs, and we all know how effective the war on drugs has been. It's time to accept that personal use of narcotics isn't something we need to use police raids for.

It has its distinct and insurmountable limitations when applied to public personnel management. The very nature and purposes of Government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with Government employee organizations. The employer is the whole people, who speak by means of laws enacted by their representatives in Congress. Accordingly, administrative officials and employees alike are governed and guided, and in many instances restricted, by laws which establish policies, procedures, or rules in personnel matters."

Just from casual news consumption alone I can recall a few horrific examples including an infant whose face was severely damaged/disfigured by a flash bang and a black adolescent girl who was shot in the head while watching TV next to her grandma.

 Heartland is a safety net nonprofit system in a rural area with few insured people that aren't medicare/medicaid. If nobody paid their bills they would not have any money left to operate, basically, since large pockets of rural Missouri resemble a third world nation.

BJC in St. Louis is also a nonprofit. Because it is in a rich metro area with 85% of its residents insured either public or private they make a ton of money, and can afford to write off billions of dollars in unpaid care every year even without the patient contacting them and informing BJC of exigent financial circumstances. Heartland would probably love to have BJC's financials but we have a completely broken "system" of healthcare that's getting increasingly worse due to lack of universal coverage or cost controls.    |-|

When I arrived at the scene, they said they found what they were looking for, which they would not specify(for super important police reasons). Then they basically scribbled down the case number on a scrap of paper and told me "good luck" with getting my doors paid for by the city because they found evidence.

These fuckers are outside the house high fiving and patting each other on the back acting like they just busted the case of the century. No arrests were made and my tenants are all still living at the house, sans working doors. This is not freedom. |-|

No knock warrents are a horrible idea.  They are horrible for officer safety and horrible for the community and almost never even necessary. 

 Officers serve no knock warrent in castle doctrine state.  Occupants open fire on police under castle doctrine.  Siting cases of criminals breaking in and identifying themselves as police to gain upper hand on the occupants.  Maybe the occupants lose the case because they had illegal weapons and drugs and the warrant was correct.   What if the warrant was wrong.  There are several cases of the police serving the warrant on the wrong damn house.   What is a law abiding citizen who has never done anything wrong and suddenly people are breaking into their house and yelling sposed to think.   I know what I would be thinking even if they were screaming police police.  I would be thinking I havent done anything wrong these must be home invaders im going to defend myself with deadly force.

If you have enough information to get a no knock warrent then you have the infrastructure in place to know when no one is in the house. Arrest your suspects in public and serve the warrent when the house is empty.

Edit: I am not against police.  If you check my comment history I have actually recently firmly defended their job and right to defend themselves.   But in the case of no knock warrents they are going to far.  I have a right to defend myself as well. |-|

If they don't announce their presence or who they are, the resident may attack the police in self-defense, under the belief they are trespassing. And how can you blame someone for trying to defend their home and themselves from intruders? Additionally, firing at police will always result in the police firing back.. and usually killing the shooter. I'm sure this happens countless times and is simply a result of miscommunication and misunderstanding. If the police are forced to announce their presence, then the resident has no excuse for mistaking them for intruders and then may be less inclined to 'defend' their home. |-|

Seems off.  It's like reading documents from slave auctions for a class on U.S. history, and then claiming that the class made you read the documents from slave auctions without historical context on race relations.  The documents themselves are the context.

Citizens should not have their safety endangered or have to hesitate for fear of mistakenly shooting an officer just because some drug dealers in another location are breaking the law. In situations where police get the wrong house, break in, and behave like home invaders they need to be fully responsible, both personally and as a department, for EVERY consequence of that raid, and if the citizen defends themselves with a firearm then the officers who screwed up need to be charged with homicide. This is especially important because of copy-cat crimes where criminals pretend to be police serving a no-knock raid in order to prevent their victims from fighting back.

The war on drugs is dubious enough, but endangering the lives of honest citizens is totally unacceptable.

Silly me, I thought you needed some sort of evidence (or high level of suspicion of evidence) from some credible source to secure a warrant in the first place.

Seems like she's saying that they need no-knock warrants to secure a conviction that they otherwise wouldn't be able to get.  In that case, fuck off.  Stop the guy in his driveway and then search.   Maybe try having the swat team move away from the peep hole and have a plain clothes officer knock.  Nobody is flushing their stash on account of a single random stranger knocking.

If you can't get a conviction without the evidence inside then it doesn't sound like you have much to go off of and these no-knock searches aren't worth the harm they've caused.  |-|

|-| cnxm5fv || 3 || Dear Carrie Mills. I am a law abiding citizen. Worst ticket I ever got was for going 1mph over the speed limit (41 in a 40) which was thrown out.

never been arrested never done drugs. I don't even drink.

THIS is the reality. if someone smashes into my home I am killing whatever comes through the door.

DO you honestly think I want to have to live with killing an officer that thinks he is doing his job? I won't ask who they are I won't listen to who they are I won't look at who they are. I will summarily kill them. instantly as fast as I can with as many rounds as I can. Dead. Fire until I am out of ammo.

you see if you come crashing through my door I CAN NOT wait to identify you. You clearly mean to do me harm or you would be KNOCKING like a civilized human being. The fact that your an officer is a sad side effect but you must die.

the reason is simple. if your NOT a cop then my family is dead. since I AM a law abiding citizen I have no logical reason to suspect your "good guys" smashing through my door. if I want half a second and am wrong I AM DEAD.

SO my choice is restricted to a single choice. KILL anything that comes through that door until I have complete control of the situation.

THIS will be the result of a no knock warrant. I don't have a choice. my only chance is to hope I don't kill any of your officers and hope they don't kill me.

Your job is not to solve crime your job is not to uphold laws and statutes. those are "secondary" your JOB. your SWORN duty is to preserve protect and defend the constitution of these united states.

FINISHED. DONE. that is it. THAT is your job. anything in contradiction of that sworn oath is b definition treason. a violation of the constitution and a violation of your sworn oath.

DO your job first. then do other things that don't violate your sworn oath.

I am telling you here and now. not as a threat but as a simple fact of reality. no different from gravity or the laws of thermodynamics.

anything comes crashing through my door I am killing it. I won't stop shooting until I am dead or I am in complete control of my domain such that I can protect my family.

that is final. that is not up for negotiation.

your "desire" to retain evidence does not usurp MY right to protect my family my home and myself. |-|

Barrett Brown was sentenced to 63 months for the possession of thousands of stolen credit card numbers and CVVs.

Specifically, he was convicted under [18 U.S.C. §§ 2](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2), [1029(a)(3), and 1029(c)(1)(A)(i).](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1029)

And people may or may not like this, but if you "find" a folder on the road containing thousands of credit card numbers and details and then you:

* tell people who you know want stolen credit cards where they are
* tell people what specific steps they have to take to get them
* discuss what they should do, illegally, with the stolen credit card numbers once they get them
* ask for, **and receive**, copies of those credit card numbers

you have committed a crime and the same holds true in "cyberspace".

It doesn't matter if you're a "journalist".

Although a journalist would protect the source of the information from disclosure, safeguard the information itself, inform involved parties of the risk, and then write a story which followed the [commonly and widely accepted standards of ethics in journalism](http://www.spj.org/pdf/spj-code-of-ethics.pdf) and sought to minimize or eliminate the harm to unknowing and innocent third parties. |-|

Police forces across the nation are utilizing military gear and weapons, wearing masks to protect their identity, bullet proof vests, automatic weapons and even driving armored vehicles. Why, I ask? Who are they protecting? It's not us. They are cowards who seem to only be able to interact with the public in an aggressive, dominating, uncivilized manner.  They are here to serve US. Sure policing is a dangerous job, but there are more dangerous jobs, like professional fisherman, logger, etc. Policemen, before the militarisation, before the bullet proof vest, treated people with more respect, and were rewarded with more respect from even the most hardened criminals. Actually they are no longer policemen, they are now "law enforcement officers", the difference being, they have no concern for the safety of the public which they are supposed to be serving and protecting.

There are sarcophagi just sitting there in the open air, and others stacked 5 high in the corner somewhere. Practically nothing is labeled, so you have no idea what you are looking at. The only room in the entire museum that was well kept and well organized was the mummy room—even the King Tut area (where this mask sits) is a mess.  |-|

|-| cnxr9pw || 9 || The need for no knock raids is to break into the house and apprehend all occupants before any of them can FLUSH DRUGS DOWN THE TOILET.

These are SEARCH warrants not ARREST warrants.

The reasoning is that given too much advance notice, the drugs that are suspected of being in the house will be flushed down the toilet as the occupant will surely try to flush them before answering the door.

As anyone who is familiar with flushing things, only powder and liquids can be disposed quickly. Leafy things and pills tend to float. That is, it will certainly take more than one flush to dispose of a handful.

The consequence of any police raiding a house is that occupants have been shot and many killed, including pets. Worse, is when it is the wrong house and they are killed.

Fellow citizens, I beg you to consider, there is NOTHING of value that would be lost comparable to the worst that might happen in a police raid. There is NOTHING in a house that police need to have guns drawn.

If EVER an occupant can flush his drugs, believe me, he did not have much anyway, and his lost is enough even if he is spared an arrest.

It is reprehensible for any civilized society to allow any law enforcement to force their way into homes for anything less than a hostage situation. Such a policy creates a thick barrier between LE and the citizenry, as training swat teams they are desensitized to ALL OTHERS, therefore, often hostages are shot by the raiding officers. 

The need for armed police is to combat armed assailants. Unfortunately, the police are given the conception they are armed to enforce their authority, which too often they have used their weapons without restraint.

NO-KNOCK = MURDER!

Just like many other things cops and our government do...this is just as much about money as it is safety.

I'd be concerned about so many traps near hiking trails. The article says traps are forbidden with 1/4 mile of trails on a designated trail list.

3.  The family dog seems to be always killed in these raids.  It does not matter the temperament or size of the dog (and sometimes cats).

|-| cny3swh || 13 || Reading this thread a little late, but I feel compelled to comment here after reading the responses from others.  I'm an American who is currently living in China, and there seem to be an unreasonable amount of misconceptions about China.  

When I first moved here, I was slightly uncomfortable with how "dirty", China felt.  Yes, mothers really will have their children shit in trash cans.  That being said, it really isn't as common as the other posters seem to be implying.  I've seen it maybe... 5 times over the last few months?  It's not like you'll see human waste laying around everywhere.  Yeah, it's gross when you do, but it's really not all that common.  

After living here for a while, I've noticed a certain disconnect between the US and China when it comes to cleanliness.  Western cultures tend to keep the city streets and such far cleaner.  Regular cleaning maintenance, no overflowing trash cans, no open air meat markets, that sort of thing.  Because of this, Western cultures often see China as dirty.

What surprised me, though, is that Westerners are often thought of as dirty in China, too - the longer I live here, the more I realize that both cultures do things that are rather unhygenic without even thinking of it, because it is culturally acceptable.  Shoes are not allowed indoors here - instead, you change into slippers every time you go inside.  Usually you can't bring your shoes into the apartment, even.  Most people have boxes of shoes outside the apartment, and boxes of slippers inside the apartment. If you bring your shoes inside, you can expect to be yelled at.  You absolutely cannot go near the bed in clothes that you have worn outside, or before you have showered.  If anything touches the floor of a room, it cannot touch the bed.  This seemed excessive to me for a while, but after a few weeks of following this cultural tradition, I was surprised how much *cleaner* everything felt.  

Food can never touch your hands here.  Eating peanuts?  Either eat them with chopsticks, or pour them from the packet into your mouth.  Considering how dirty your hands get (yes, even in Western countries), this makes a lot of sense, but when I was living in the US, I didn't think twice before touching my food.  At a restaurant?  The dishes are shrink-wrapped, and you have to rewash the dishes in tea before you eat with them.  Everything has to be well organized, and the inside of rooms is usually spotless.  

Cleanliness isn't the only misconception I've seen in this thread, though.  I've seen responses from Americans who have gone to China, and were surprised when the people acted so "rude".  You can't expect people to form an orderly line when that just isn't part of the culture!  That's just how it works here - it isn't considered rude at all, it's just cultural.  Similarly, I've seen a lot of westerners do things that are considered rude here - which often comes as a result of being way too direct, something that isn't common in Chinese culture.

The truth is, both places have different cultures.  While you might think that some of the things that Chinese people do is rude, chances are, they'd think the exact same thing of you!  While I completely agree that when visiting a country, you should try to adapt to the traditions, perhaps it is best to give a certain amount of lenience, because they might not know that what they are doing is unacceptable. |-|

|-| cny5gqd || 4 || When I read this title the first thing I thought was, "I bet it was a substitute teacher." I don't know what it is about subs, but they seem to do the most inappropriate shit. 

I had a really, really bad incident with a substitute teacher when I was in second grade. We had this really young substitute for three days and she was strict as hell. On the third day she was sitting at the circular table next to me while we were doing some work. 

My best friend was on the other side of her and  she kept refusing to let him use the restroom, all day long, when drama suddenly ensued. He started to literally cry about it and she sent him to the office. I told her that our teacher lets us go when we need to and she can't talk to us like that. I can't quite remember how it transpired—partly because it was 20 years ago, but also it was kind of traumatic—but the next thing I know is that she has my head on the table and is holding it there (hard) with both her hands.

I basically lost my shit and started telling her that my mom was going to get her fired, beat her up, sue her, the works. That she can't put her hands on me and all this other stuff. I'm respectful person and I've always been courteous to my elders, but I knew my mom would've beat this woman's ass had she walked in and wasn't afraid to stick up for myself.

When I told my mom as she picked me up from school I thought her head was going to explode. She jumped out of the car and *ran* towards my classroom. Luckily the lady was gone because I don't know what would've happened had she been there.

After going to the office the campus police showed up as well as several other teachers, the principal, my counselor, and a few other office staff. It was a huge scene. The lady lost her job and apparently the county did something to her as well, but I never found out the details.

It's people like them that give substitute teachers a bad wrap.

|-| cny7yv7 || 4 || Man the American police just comes off as some gangster outfit. I read the book "gang leader for a day" about gangs in New York in the 80s and that was  real eye opener towards how the police operated.

They seem like an especially effective criminal organization because they can do so many crimes without getting caught.

It sadly reminds me a bit too much about police in developing countries like a friend who lived in Thailand for several years told me about how the police was the biggest drug gang. Because of the harsh penalties for drug trafficking it made it easier for them to take out rival gangs. They could just shoot the competition on the spot, because the drug laws allowed that.

So ironically harsh laws just increased the crime rate. I have a feeling that is what is going on in the US too. I think US cops can act more like gansters compared to other western police because they have so many harsh laws they can threaten people with. Just simple things such as resisting arrest can get you into a lot of trouble. It also helps them that they got that "Hero" label on them. No matter how much wrong they do, people will more often than not side with the cops. |-|

|-| co0z51d || 808 ||  A lot of people here are pretty misinformed about this. Here is a rough outline of events:

1. [Epstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein) is investigated by FBI for soliciting child prostitutes. Shit was pretty serious, with allegedly dozens of girls and some as young as 12. 99%ers would be shitting bricks. But Epstein called up his homie Dershowitz and a few others to set up the legal A-Team (did I mention Epstein is a billionaire?) and he ended up pleading to regular grown-up prostitution and served about a year in prison.

2. Fast forward 7 years and Paul Cassell and Brad Edwards file a lawsuit against the *government* on behalf of Jane Doe #3 and other alleged victims. The gist of it is "government had no right to strike a deal with Epstein while disregarding the victims". The deal, by the way, was pretty dope in that it provided immunity to all potential co-conspirators on top of letting Epstein serve a year for what would be decades for almost anyone else.

3. In that lawsuit, the alleged victim, Jane Doe #3, made the statements about having sex with Dershowitz and Prince Andrew. Dershowitz went on a full blown [offensive](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/famed-attorney-alan-dershowitz-not-taking-sexual-assault-accusations-lying-down/article/2558111), saying he has alibis for everything, threatening the disbarment of her lawyers, and asking that they repeat the claims in media so he can sue them for defamation.

4. He went so strong, that actually her lawyers [sued](http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/01/06/jane-doe-lawyers-sue-dershowitz-for-defamation/) *him* or defamation as he said some pretty nasty things about them. He also seemed to be grasping for some straws when he tried to connect this with his Israel advocacy. 

5. But keep in mind that in all of this, Dershowitz currently faces no legal threat. There are no proceedings against him and the statute of limitations has expired for all of the alleged incidents mentioned in the lawsuit. What's really hurting him is that these statements are a blow to his reputation. As he [explains](http://www.wsj.com/articles/alan-m-dershowitz-a-nightmare-of-false-accusation-that-could-happen-to-you-1421280860) on WSJ, there is literally nothing he can do about it. He can't challenge them in court because there is no case against him, he can't sue them for defamation and they are not required to prove that claim. 

6. Dershowitz himself has speculated that the defendant named him because he was one the lawyers who drafted Epstein's deal so if he can be compromised, then the deal might be too. 

7. Now we got to this news story where Jane Doe #3 is claiming under oath that he had sex with her when she was underage. He still isn't in any legal trouble. |-|

So not only was the time he was sentenced to incredibly light given the seriousness of the charges, he basically only had to spend 8 hours a day in jail. I guess he'd just show up for bedtime. Meanwhile, if it was a normal person facing these charges they might be looking at life in a prison. What a justice system.

|-| co0lacz || 1120 || Either someone committed perjury or Alan Dershowitz is full of shit when he goes on CNN denying he had sex with her.  |-| 
|-| co0vc98 || 256 || While I'm always wary of the fact that the media/the public is prone to ignore presumption of innocence when it comes to certain types of crime, I think that in this particular case there are certain red flags.

There is no doubt (phone records, flight records, documents etc) that Epstein employed this underage girl as a "personal masseuse," even though she had absolutely no formal training or experience as a masseuse. Epstein is now a registered sex offender. There is no doubt in my mind that this girl was basically employed by Epstein as a full time prostitute.

There is also very little doubt that both Dershowitz and Prince Andrew (I'm also going to include him since the denials have been equally vocal) spent some time with both Epstein and this girl.

The one thing that isn't certain is if they had sex with her.

So what it comes down to is whether or not your believe that a middle age man spends time with an underage prostitute for any other reason and with any outcome than sex. Personally I believe the logical answer is no. |-| 
|-| co0qz4r || 345 || ITT: why we have due process. |-| 
|-| co0z1as || 52 || 1. There was a billionaire financier named Epstein who accepted a plea deal (I agree to go to jail if you stop prosecuting me) for having kept what was basically a harem of under-age sex slaves. Dershowitz was his lawyer iirc.

2. The government accepted this (rather low) plea deal before even CHARGING Epstein. Epstein got an extraordinarily light sentence, something like 18 months in minimum security. No matter where you stand, this should make you mad. Guy kept a number of underage sex slaves and takes a plea deal that involves very light prison time and without even being charged. 

3. There is a federal statute that says that the government has to consult with the victims of certain sex crimes concerning the case against the alleged accuser.

4. The lawsuit here is by several of the former underage girls who claim that the government did not consult with them concerning Epstein before reaching this deal. The lawsuit originally involved Jane Does #1 and #2, and the court did rule that the government should've consulted with them (or something to that effect, I have not read the case).

5. The plaintiffs' attorneys, two fairly established guys, are trying to join at least two more Jane Doe's in the case against the government.

6. As they were trying to join these Jane Does, they filed a "motion." In the motion, Jane Doe said that she was forced to have sex with, among others, Prince Andrew and Dershowitz. Dershowitz was one of Epstein's lawyers.

7. There are pictures of Jane Doe #3 with Prince Andrew and Epstein and a woman that likely acted as Epstein's madame.

8. Dershowitz flipped his shit on every major media source, saying the accusations were a lie, and trying to get the plaintiffs' attorneys to repeat the girl's claims about him having sex with her outside of a court document so that he could sue them for slander/libel (he can't sue them for saying it in a court document).  He also said "they didn't even offer sworn testimony!"

9. The plaintiffs' attorneys sued Dershowitz because Dershowitz pretty much said they were lying!

10. Then the plaintiffs' attorneys had the girl offer sworn testimony (that's what this article is about).

I don't know who's right and who's wrong, but I think it's noteworthy that NOBODY GETS ANY MONEY FROM ANYONE by saying that Dershowitz raped these girls. They might get publicity, but that's about all.

One kinda shitty thing--this accusation about Dershowitz raping this girl is NOT part of a court case against Dershowitz. That means that Dershowitz need not fear having to pay out if he DID do this--but on the other hand, he will never get to clear his name, if he didn't do this. |-|

According to Jane Doe #1, she was harassed and 'bullied' by one of Epstein's lawyers during the court proceedings.
But, despite testifying to a court, she says she did not hear from prosecutors until 2008, by which time Epstein had already negotiated the non-prosecution agreement (NPA). 
Experts in criminal law in America still question how Epstein’s legal team pulled off the deal that saw him avoid a jail sentence of ten to 20 years. 
Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2, the name used in US legal proceedings for people with anonymity, are now suing the U.S government over the NPAs. 
They claim the government failed to protect their rights when it entered a plea deal with Epstein.
Two more women, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4, now want to join the case. It is the woman known as Jane Doe #3 - Ms Roberts - who has made claims regarding Prince Andrew.
Since Jane Doe #1 made her claims, 40 women have come forward claiming that Epstein abused them too. Almost all have settled their cases.

And it was George W. Bush's DOJ, not Obama's so it's not like somebody was helping him for political reasons because he was a big-time Democratic fundraiser.  The only scenario I can think of is somebody in the Bush administration who thought "you know, we can use this to go after the Clintons if Hillary wants to run later..." but that just speculation of my part.

By the way, I have a hard time believing that Bill Clinton was involved with underage women in this situation... yes, he clearly likes to f*ck, he's some kind of pervert... but I think he prefers consenting women...not sex-slaves of any age... but again that just me thinking... |-| 
|-| co12syo || 7 || Time for a horrifying example of how disgusting reddit can be sometimes. Last time this story was posted, the current state of events was this:

Jane Doe #3, a victim of Jeffrey Epstein's infamous child sex trafficking ring, says in her testimony against Epstein that his good friend Alan Dershowitz was one of the men he forced her to have sex. Dershowitz, obviously, makes a statement saying he's never met her and that he has alibis disproving her claims. Just **a statement**.

This story covering his statement is upvoted to the very top of /r/JusticePorn with 5287 points, as if *the girl* had been served justice. Some of the most highly-upvoted comments are as follows:

&gt; That Jane Doe #3 sure seems to get around.

` `

&gt; I think he should also push for the judgement to include allowances for him to climb to the top of a tall building, and yell "I AM THE LAW" before kicking his accuser into a pit.

` `

&gt; This girl should be jailed and required to register as a predatory sex 
offender.

` `

&gt; I think I got a semi by reading this.

` `

&gt; Jane Doe #3 is a fucking cunt. Those who accuse others should have their name plastered all over media just as much as the innocent (until proven guilty!!) names of those they accuse.

` `

"British Progressives Ignore Child Rape In Rotherham, Protest Porn Ban"

December 13, 2014

"For years, British nationalists warned about the Muslim practice of “grooming” English girls through drug addiction and intimidation and then raping them.  They were ignored, mocked, and persecuted.  Then, it was discovered that thousands of young white girls had been raped by Muslim gangs over a decade and the evil racists had been right again.

The media quickly reacted — by warning everyone that the “real danger” was “the stereotype of the Asian abuser and the white victim.”  As usual, an Establishment consensus developed that there needed to be redoubled efforts against white “racism” and “extremism” instead of directly confronting the problem.

Demonstrations by the white British against the mass rape of their children were widely condemned by the press in terms far more emotional and passionate than those they used against the crimes themselves.  [EDL supporters attack police during Rotherham sex abuse protest, The Guardian, September 13, 2014]  And many local businessmen were more upset about protests than the rapes, advocating for demonstrations to be banned, all the better to get back to buying and selling.  [Rotherham protest: Traders call for demonstration ban, BBC, October 3, 2014]

Needless to say, feminists were nowhere to be found protesting the gang rape of hundreds of young girls.

Recently, David Cameron’s Tories implemented a ban on portraying certain sex acts in online pornography.  Leftists who don’t care about the British government banning political debate leapt into action, conducting a protest in front of Parliament in defense of their smut, to the gleeful cheers of the media.  [Porn protest: Westminster hosts a new take on ‘sitdown protest’ by Oscar Quine, The Independent, December 12, 2014]  “Sex workers,” the new PC term for practitioners of the first profession, were prominent among the protesters.

This is more context to consider when examining the media frenzies about #UVARapes and #BlackLivesMatter.  Some rapes matter, and some rapes don’t.  Some kinds of free speech are worth defending (degeneracy) and others aren’t (actual debate about important issues.)  What stay’s the same is the Narrative — traditional Western populations are always guilty, and whatever bad happens to them, they had it coming."

Since the highest percentage of incarcerated people are those of darker skin colour, it's only natural you try to recreate a practice scenario that will represent an actual situation as much as possible. In layman's terms, as bad as it sounds, a cop will most likely be shooting at a black man. It's just... statistics. On the other hand it perpetuates the mentality that all dark coloured people are in need of a bullet and hopefully, body cameras will decrease the unnecessary violence that we see today.  |-|

|-| co19bfw || 2739 || Waze isn't a "police tracking app" it's a GPS app that points out hazards on the road, including police activity. Police activity on the side of the road causes traffic to slow down. Having advanced warning of that is a GOOD thing.  |-|

Really? That's all that's stopping a mentally deranged killer? The fact they can't find a cop quick enough? Stop by my 7-eleven some time, bro. I don't need Waze to find a cop there every night. Cops on a diet? If only there was some kind of emergency hotline that could summon police within minutes.

Which isn't to say "here's a cop, go kill him". We both know that this "cop murderer" excuse is bullshit. Just admit you don't like the idea of something preventing you from milking funds from the public.

But this isn't an app designed to track the police. And they're not worried about people using it to find cops. They're worried about people slowing down near cops, and then not getting ticketed. Stop acting like a fucking revenue-generating service and you'll be fine, fuckfaces.

How thinly veiled can your true motives be, officers? I'd respect you more for being honest.

It's the 20-30 something women on their phones.  If Google caves to this, well, guess I'll be buying a new phone and finding browser, search engine, map, etc alternatives.  

By the way, anyone know if the cops got Trapster shut down?  This solution makes me think they probably did because that was a widely used app specifically intended for warning others of speed traps.  |-|

|-| co1bup0 || 5 || &gt; *There are no known connections between any attack on police and Waze*, but law enforcers such as Kopelev are concerned it's only a matter of time.

This is about money, plain and simple. These officers aren't worried about safety because of people knowing where they are; the only thing they give a shit about it is writing tickets.

More people knowing where speed traps are = fewer tickets = less money for departments.

and of course the revenue that is speed traps. if awareness of a police presence makes people slow down, they should be applauding it.

The sheriff is more worried about revenue loss. I'd be curious if any law enforcement agency can actually point to a dip in revenue that correlates to the raise in popularity of Waze.

If the sheriff wants the police reporting functionality to go away, they need to come up with a just reason. Tracking police and their safety is not even possible with Waze. You can't go "hunting" with the app. The sheriff is full of shit.

Waze provides the ability to find a police officer if needed as well and I highly debate the fact people are using waze to seek out and stalk cops.

|-| co15crw || 17 || Notice it says, "financed" solar.  This is a great deal if you get a fixed rate.  If you get an adjustable rate it could be a terrible deal if(when) rates rise. |-|

|-| co15bb7 || 15 || Is this including the rather large subsidies to solar companies and customers?  That's not really cheaper, that's just someone else paying for it.

(I mean real subsidies too, not general business tax breaks claiming that letting business keep their earned revenue is "subsidy," or any other pseudo-subsidy.) |-| 
|-| co18202 || 3 || I have solar and I like it, but you do have to maintain your batteries. I keep batteries in basement in a sealed room. It does smell like acid in there and I did have one battery bloat up and explode on me. I have 48 batteries and there is also cost associated with disposal. My neighbor who also has same setup puts his batteries in black bags and tosses them into garbage. We also had a hail storm few years back and a few panels needed to be replaced. Insurance company was wavering.  |-| 
|-| co16pd9 || 6 || I am the owner of a building within a block, meaning the roofs are connected. I love solar, and in my case it actually would be profitable after a few years. The issue is that there is usually graffiti on mine, which means assholes are going onto my roof. If I put a solar setup there it would likely be destroyed within a few months. Sure, I can put up a fence for a few thousand dollars, but then they could cut through or jump it. Barbed wire won't help much since it's easy to cut through.

Sure, I can get crafty and make the fence electrified but then they get shocked and take me to court and I get fucked over.

So, no solar for me. Even if it had zero upfront cost I can't do it because there will be assholes who will fuck it up. And this is a big problem for moderately urban areas where roofs are connected.

Edit: For reference, here is what my roof kind of looks like
https://www.google.com/maps/@40.668535,-73.979638,127a,20y,41.79t/data=!3m1!1e3 |-| 
|-| co1897t || 4 || So if I assume I can borrow money for 25 years at 5% interest and compare it to 2.3% inflation, solar would make sense. Not really reasonable.

First, you can't borrow money for a solar lease at 5%. It's somewhere around 8-9%.

Second, installation costs throughout the country are very different.

Third, and this is something that greatly underestimated when considering a solar installation, the wires and polls (distribution) costs are only going to go up over time. And much higher than inflation. It's partially just the cost of doing business (cost of material, labor, storms, etc.) It's also because these utility companies have huge pension obligations that haven't been properly funded. 

Fourth, if solar makes sense, commercial users will adopt it much faster than residential because the payoff would make even more sense given then same funding options. That means another part of the rate base will adopt, lowering their usage. This lowered usage causes the rates of other rate payers to go up. Why? Because the costs get spread out over a lower quantity. (This is just the name of the game in the utility space)

Fifth, the "subsidy" for solar is a tax credit. That means you're still putting down $20k for a solar install. You just get money from the government after you've filed your taxes for the previous year. A lease can solve a lot of that, but you need to be careful with a long term lease.

Sixth, STFU about oil companies and electric power. The oil industry doesn't give a crap. There's so little power produced from oil. It's just not economic to use it. Sometimes it's used as backup generation in certain areas of the country. But ever oil power plant could close tomorrow (they rarely run at this point) and no one would notice even in  the electric power industry. |-|

|-| cogbui6 || 21 || If this was a sitcom, soon after marrying he'd finally get parole for good behavior, and she'd be forced to house and support him. Hilarity ensues. 

In all seriousness though, I hope his dead body is incinerated when the time comes. Anything else is just messed up.  |-|

|-| cogarrf || 31 || If this is true, it is kind of funny since Charles Manson is so use to trying to play other people, it's nice he got played for once. |-|

|-| coggibc || 8 || he probably got turned down for conjugal visits. if you are going to live for ever then why not bang some young bird who wants to have your corpse, jokes on her since you wont ever die. Jokes aside isnt his corpse being on display in a glass case pretty much his best chance at living for ever? Poor girl probably thought he would like it since hes always talking about living forever, when he flipped out saying he will never die she probably realized how fucking nuts he was. she thought everything he said up until then was a metaphor lol. |-| 
|-| cog9hd6 || 12 || Well she seems ... sweet ...  |-| 
|-| coghyqr || 6 || Welp, at least she has the unique distinction of being so cray that even Charles Manson wouldn't marry her. |-|

|-| cogs8kg || 4 || You mean Manson didn't like the idea of his death being used to further someone else's reputation? Hmm, wished he had that same sentiment before he did the same. |-|

Do you hear that shit? This man wasn't even phased by this whole ploy. In the end he was just like; "Heh, this bitch thinks that **I'm** going to die? She must not be aware that I'm a God.". 

Jesus.  |-| 
|-| cogrvq8 || 3 || She quite literally wanted him for his body. |-| 
|-| cogrxj4 || 3 || Does this mean she's single?!?! |-| 
|-| cogs3jo || 3 || Hey I just met you  
And we're both crazy

|-| cogwk16 || 4 || This girl moved to town around 2008 or so. She can be seen around town often, always alone, always walking. I don't think she owns a car. I don't think she has a regular job either, my guess is that she supports herself from her Charles Manson fan sites by donations and merchandise sales.

She's weird, at one point a few years ago, she tattooed a swastika on her head and shaved off all her hair. She has since regrown her hair. I don't know if she had the tattoo removed or covers it up with makeup but it's not visible.

Last time I saw her was right before Christmas, she was filling out a tall stack of Christmas Greeting cards at the Post Office. At a distant glance, the addresses looked like they were addressed to inmates. "Seasons Greetings from the Manson family" |-| 
|-| cogxmew || 3 || You know there's a problem when even Charles Manson thinks you're crazy |-|

|-| cogh0lp || 4 || Poor guy, what he ever do to deserve that? |-| 
|-| cogs7r7 || 4 || I'm questioning the validity of this story.   Afton Burton aka Star, moved out to California in 2007 to be near Charles Manson.  You don't devote 8 years of your life for some crazy plan to hopefully have it payoff.  I genuinely believe she is more "star" struck, than anything else.  Lots of women go for convicted serial killers and although Manson never actually committed the murders, his "groupies" were mesmerized by him enough to kill for him.   Maybe she did plan on putting his corpse up for display, but I don't believe this was her sole motivation to marry the man.   I won't necessarily say she is love with him but a big part of her identity is being involved with Charles Manson.   |-| 
|-| cogkzz3 || 3 || Mason's response was awesomely comical:

Yeah? Well I'm not going to die anyway so jokes on you.  And, I was stringing  YOU on......take that lol |-| 
|-| cogm88l || 3 || Charles Manson: I'm not pushing through with the wedding. I might be crazy, but I'm not THAT crazy!

|-| cogni3d || 3 || I'd give up my corpse if I could land a hot crazy wife like that.  |-| 
|-| cogpmaa || 3 || You know the bitch was crazy when Charles fucking Manson nopes the fuck out. |-| 
|-| cogpx2p || 3 || It must suckered to believe you will never die...and be sentenced to life in prison |-| 
|-| cogui78 || 3 || Charlie Manson really dodged a bullet there. You really don't want to marry a crazy person.  |-| 
|-| cogwci6 || 3 || The saddest part about that is this makes her less crazy than just marrying him for love.  |-| 
|-| cogwnbu || 3 || andddddd the world makes sense once again. |-| 
|-| cogwqb0 || 3 || People seem to forget that nothing is reliable about anything related to Manson. Chances are Manson made this up himself. We don't know much about him or what he does/wants, because of these kind of mystifying and romantic anecdotes about him.

He's a lunatic. Nothing more, nothing less.  |-| 
|-| cogxgk8 || 3 || Typical May/Dismember romance.... |-| 
|-| cogb95z || 4 || "He feels he will never die."  What's the big deal then, Chuck?  Why not give it a whirl with this girl if you'r going to outlast her anyway?  Maybe you can put her corpse on display some day, amirite? |-|

There is no fence and you live in open barracks. Most of the political crimes get you sent there. Even if he was at the low FCI Loretto it is basically a college campus surrounded by a fence.

When people hear prison they think it is like how the movies show it. Those are the USP's and they can be intimidating even to work in. But by no means did this guy go to a real prison.

That seems like an odd mention. Does Viagra actually peg the price of their pills to inflation? Even if they did, according to the Consumer Price Index inflation calculator, $10 in '98 has the same buying power as $14.52 today.

He was stealing and scraping cars repeatedly. The Officer in question is a nice guy who is spat on, punched, cussed out, and kicked on a daily basis and the incident in which he punched a 13 year old kid is one sided. the kid was over 6ft so i would hardly call that a kid. he had cut line at lunch and after being asked to move to the back not once twice but four times he pushed the officer to the ground and tried to stomp on him. Now I dont know about any of you but if a 6ft man child pushed me down and tried to stomp on me I would get back up and put his ass on the ground too. I believe both sides should be heard as it is not fair to the officer who has to show so much restraint get punished for doing what you would do to a grown man assaulting you, judge for yourselves. |-|

|-| cog21dc || 60 || If you can't treat animals ethically, just cry to government to outlaw journalism! |-| 
|-| cog33cx || 45 || This is one of those things that makes me think:

"hmmm... I figured things were kind of bad in those plants, but if this is what they're willing to do to make sure that no pictures of what's happening gets out, then it must be wayyy worse than I'm imagining."

Personally, I wish meat and milk and eggs (and really all food) in the grocery store had a little video playing next to it, that showed where it was grown, how it was made, and the people who prepared it.

Subconsciously we take a lot of cues from packaging and names, so it's easy to think that some box of cookies, or some gallon of milk is "all natural" because they show green pastures and happy cows/kids on the package. But really, both of them could be heavily processed products made on huge industrial scales by employees who are underpaid and have no benefits. I'd gladly pay an extra couple bucks.

For example, Trader Joes sells a frozen pizza that says it's "hand made made in italy" and normally I look at something like that and think "yeah, they want me to think it's some quaint little baker in the italian countryside making it, but it's probably some huge factory, and the people pushing the buttons use their hands. Maybe it's not even made in italy, maybe it's just packaged there or something."

But then on the back of the box is an actual picture of the pizzas being made, and it's not a quaint little baker, but you can actually see what's going on. The pizzas are on a conveyor belt, and the people are all wearing white coats and hairnets, and the oven is a big stainless steel thing, but ...

They are actually making them by hand, and the oven is actually burning wood, and it looks like a nice place, not a quaint bakery, but not a giant factory either.

This is the kind of picture that 99% of companies wouldn't put on their package because they want you to use your imagination and think things are actually nicer than they actually are. But in this case, they can show you the truth, and it's actually pretty good.

That's the complete opposite of these ag-gag laws. We're imagining that factory farming is probably pretty bad, but apparently things are worse than we think because they'll do anything to keep us from seeing the truth. |-|

So they want to have this information reported *immediately* rather than having people wait months or even a year in some cases, editing the video and preparing for a media blitz? Wow...you'd think people that supposedly cared about the welfare of animals would support that.

I think that if you aren't a well versed fan, you wouldn't know any better if the movie was completely off.

My wife watched the entirety of Avatar, but I kind of watched it over her shoulder while doing something else. When the Avatar movie came out, I didn't think it was that bad of a movie. Some of the major scenes I recognized, and it kind of looked like what happened in the show. It wasn't until my wife explained to me all of the things that weren't true to the source, that I noticed how off the movie was.

In this case, if someone had less knowledge of the source, they wouldn't be so harsh on the movie.

TLDR; Melbourne based brewery Monster Mash recieved cease-and-desist order from Monster Energy Drinks. Now trades as Kaiju (Japanese for 'Monster') |-| 
|-| coh034k || 8 || Who knew Red Bull would turn out to be a patent troll?

Actually, "bull" is a gender, like "boar" or "drake," not a species of animal, whereas an ox is. Hell, except for a 'd' and an 'l' there aren't even any similar *letters* in the names.

Maybe [Lamborgini](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/df/Lamborghini_Logo.svg/896px-Lamborghini_Logo.svg.png), [Elmer's Glue](http://ecoscene.info.yorku.ca/files/2013/04/Elmers-Glue-Logo.gif), and [Borden's Dairy](http://addicted2ads.weebly.com/uploads/1/6/9/2/16926582/309676_orig.png) should sue Red Bull...
 |-| 
|-| cogspcp || 22 || Fuck Red Bull. I never buy them because they cost twice as much, they are half the size of other energy drinks, and you are paying for their constant over-advertising.  |-| 
|-| coh093u || 7 || Redbull has also done that to a local brewery. It is called Redwell brewery. It is named after a street in the city.

 |-| 
|-| coh0e8d || 6 || This makes me sad - I drink Red Bull regularly but if this is how they treat other companies, especially smaller start ups, then I'll stop buying. There are a million other caffeinated beverages. 

Beer and energy drinks are not nearly the same. I think this lawsuit is insane. How can anyone confuse the two? What a shame. And I buy a lot of red bull, drink at least 3-4 cans a day. Not much to them but they're still losing my money. |-|

|-| cogq2bj || 6 || lol there was a malt liquor called red bull before red bull and this caused a lot of confusion for me anyway |-| 
|-| cogsphy || -15 || People have been talking about this for days in /r/beer, and the consensus seems to be that Red Bull is just asking the trademark office to clarify the trademarks in the area where they overlap (soft drinks). Old Ox seems to be throwing a huge fit over this, but I don't know if it's because they just don't understand the legal process, of if they're trying to drum up sympathy and get more business. |-|

|-| cogaql9 || 12 || ^^^ I suffered a severe spine injury, couldn't afford my loans.  Defaulted and they doubled. 5 years laters still injured, no income and loans keep building.  This couldn't be closer to the truth even if it was a cosigner.. |-| 
|-| cogafpv || 7 || I first went to college at UT in Austin,TX in 1981. The tuition for 17 hours (or credits) plus student union fees was $240. I studied mechanical engineering for 3 years because I was accepted into an honors program. This mainly meant a lot of physics, chemistry, biology, advanced differential equations, and the like. After 3 years, I was sick of the dry inhumanity of it and switched majors.

I then went to several different universities until '94 when I got Eng Lit and American history degrees. Of course I have never had a job related to these degrees. I did have a prosperous web site biz in the mid 90's, but that skill quickly became obsolete as it was automated. I don't regret my decisions. I love the knowledge I gained and am always still reading and learning. I wanted an "old world education" and got one.

Unfortunately, one of the places I went to school, in Norman, OK at OU (the rival of UT), I racked up 10 grand in student loan debt. But back then, they parsed it out in small amounts, with the highest being around $1900. So, I went into default shortly after graduating after paying them for about a year and realizing I couldn't afford it. The debts got quickly turned over to collection agencies which I have promptly ignored for 20 years. No repercusions at all, except to my credit score, but I don't need to buy anything, having a house and car fully paid off. I also did this with 2 credit cards who piled on up to 7 thousand dollars of fees on top of the measly 2-300 I spent on the cards. I don't know if you know this, but every state has a statute of limitation on credit card debt so I simply had to ignore every phone call (I immediately hung up) and every piece of mail and now those debts are gone. (The law states that you can never acknowledge the debt, by making a payment or talking to someone or the clock starts over.) |-|

|-| cogxtog || -8 || Centralized vs DECENTRALIZED

The Blockchain has been proven very stable and anti fragile, the more is attacked the stronger it gets. Governments can try to put barriers, but can't ban mathematics, can't kill decentralized systems, only can affect individual companies, but never bitcoin/blockchain itself. And it has been proven also very safe: Centralized companies/entities (Silk Road, MtGox, NeoBee, Butterfly, etc) fail due to their own corruption and/or incompetence, and can be a scam or a ‘ponzi’, like in any other area. The Blockchain (the system/protocol/platform) remains untouched because it is decentralized and 'antifragile', evolving and becoming ever stronger.

|-| cogshwh || 4 || It's not like Netflix has a huge amount of choice in their profit margins.   They have to license the materials they put up for viewing,  and they have to pay the owners for doing so.  Hell,  online radio stations like Spotify are having the exact same issue: the content owners want so much money that finding a profitable price point is really hard, even in rich/developed countries. 

I've got very little doubt that the choices here are either "relatively expensive Netflix for Cuba" or "NO Netflix for Cuba."

|-| cogezl1 || 5 || A Majority of Cubans DO NOT have access to public internet. Younger generation of Cubans have built a massive network out of consumer equipment just to share files and communicate with each other. This article was literally on reddit last week. 

AP has removed it: http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CB_CUBA_SECRET_NETWORK?SITE=AP

this article still there: http://www.konbini.com/us/lifestyle/cut-internet-cuban-kids-built-secret-online-network/

Netflix in Cuba is for the elite only. The "normal" people who do use the internet use internet cafe's ... and when you pay by the hour, no way im going to be streaming in that time ... Piracy is still the best option for Cuba .. and the $7.99 price tag (about 50% monthly income for most) guarantees that.  |-|
