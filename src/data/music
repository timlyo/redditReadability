Great song!

|-| cntzwsu || 27 || A day in the life - Beatles

Following the final orchestral crescendo, the song ends with one of the most famous final chords in music history.[16][22] Lennon, McCartney, Starr, and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on the harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The final chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.[23] |-|

From interview with bassist, Josephine Wiggs:

"When we were in the rehearsal space in San Franciscoâ¦ I think maybe we rehearsed for a week out there before actually going into the studio. It had maybe been a couple of months since we had played together because I had been in England. At that time, I was flying back and forth. So, it had been a while since we had played together. And then when we came to play âCannonballâ, itâs a pretty big slide on the low E on the bass guitar, and playing high on the neck of the bass is not something that one often does. I had made a mistake about which note I was supposed to be sliding to. Because Iâm playing on my own there, you canât tell that itâs the wrong note.

It was only when the guitars come in that I realized that I was a semi-tone flat and immediately corrected the mistake to play the song in the right key. I did it repeatedly. I kept doing it for some reason every time we came to play the song. It must just be thatâs where my hand is most comfortable, high up on the neck there, and I didnât want to push myself to have to go one fret higher, I expect is what it was. We all just thought it was hilarious and thought it sounded really great. It kind of sets up a certain expectation, and then your expectation is changed because all of a sudden itâs in a different key. It was clear to us at that moment that that was the right thing to do, to keep the wrong note in there." [source] (http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/04/interview-josephine-wiggs-of-the-breeders/)

Perhaps this doesn't count since the mistake was introduced in rehearsals and then made part of the song? |-|

The recording was done cheaply, with the lead singer straining to sing into a boom mike above the stage. To top it off, I'd read they'd stayed up all  night doing a Louie Louie singing marathon, and the lead singer had braces, so his voice was going out and his mouth was all cut up from the braces. The lyrics were so garbled there were multiple inquests by police agencies because many parents thought there were horribly explicit lyrics being sung that they just couldn't quite make out.

There's a false start, a curse word to be heard, a missing verse, and overall poor quality.  Didn't stop it from becoming a huge hit!

|-| cnu24gg || 3 || The famous "Turn it up" at the beginning of Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Sweet Home Alabama" was actually just Ronnie Van Zant asking the producer and sound engineer to turn up the volume in his headphones. Apparently they liked it enough to leave it in. |-| 
|-| cnu2axs || 16 || Good timing, even better song. |-| 
|-| cnu2c41 || 3 || We had a CRM Called ISIS at work. It's called EPIC now.

I wonder what these guys are called now?

|-| cnu2meu || 4 || At the very end of "All You Need is Love" when they're repeatedly singing "Love is all you need" someone is singing it in a very high octave. Someone yells "Stop it!" in between the repeated words, and someone else replies with "No!!" in between the next set of repeats. |-| 
|-| cnu2om0 || 14 || I will always upvote this song. |-| 
|-| cnu2qpi || 3 || Not a particularly famous song but, Sun and Ice by The Field at about the 4:40 mark the song completely glitches and shuts off for a second,  then restarts.   I remember reading in an interview that this was a complete accident that happend during recording that he decided to leave in the song.   The first time I heard it I thought my headphones broke and panicked just to return to bliss seconds later.  |-| 
|-| cnu2qs2 || 8 || Giant steps by Coltrane is a funny one. Supposedly the piano player on the original recording was having real trouble with the tempo and the chord progression. During his solo, starting at 2:55, you just feel a little sorry for him. It's like 3 minutes of Coltrane killing it, a minute of him trying to work out what key they're in, then Coltrane comes back in.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30FTr6G53VU |-| 
|-| cnu2rgf || 6 || One of my favorite songs from them and my favorite album, the progression is just perfect.

|-| cnu2xhm || 6 || You can hear a soda can open in [Stella was a Diver and She Was Always Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50khqj-3yh0) by Interpol... kinda a bit small, but it sorta bothered me.  |-| 
|-| cnu2xop || -6 || Ah nofx, the deservingly least appreciated 90s pop punk band. |-|

The guitar screeching

&gt; "So I hit the guitar hardâreally hard".[6] Ed O'Brien said: "That's the sound of Jonny trying to fuck the song up. He really didn't like it the first time we played it, so he tried spoiling it. And it made the song. |-| 
|-| cnu2zvv || 3 || Whole Lotta Love by Led Zepplin has tape printhrough, where the magnetic tape seems to have magentized the next loop in the reel. You can hear Plant come in too early, faintly, at 4:01. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mln0RciE2o0 |-|

|-| cnu3c0m || 9 || In the Velvet Underground's Heroin, Maureen Tucker's drums drop out noticeably around 6:17 while the song is at its most hectic. Apparently she couldn't hear anything, and stopped assuming everyone else would too. They didn't. So she just waited a few second before hopping back in. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin_%28The_Velvet_Underground_song%29#Recording

That song is very, very awesome https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffr0opfm6I4 |-| 
|-| cnu3el2 || 3 || Not a glitch, just a hidden message. I'm 98% sure that Dion in Runaround Sue calls her a whore with the lyrics. 'WoooahhhORE'. |-| 
|-| cnu3gqc || 9 || Trucker's Atlas - Modest Mouse

There's this weird warbling glitchy sound that happens at some point and they don't really know the source. In the Pitchfork video about Lonesome Crowded West the producer Calvin Johnson says that someone says it shouldn't be in the song and he says "well, why not?."

Modest Mouse also in general seem to have a lot of fuckups on tape from stuff that's pre-LCW. Tundra/Desert, stuff on the Interstate 8 EP, and probably most of the songs on Sad Sappy Sucker. |-|

|-| cnu3vpf || 194 || I can't say I have any gripes with the service. Lovely job with it. I have a huge respect for your dedication to this to the point where it loses you money. That said, I wouldn't mind if you decided to monetize this a little by putting an ad inside the popover.

One thing I can suggest is adding some sort of social capabilities. Sharing a playlist with a friend would be a cool dynamic. |-|

|-| cnu53vl || 4 || 'Mama Said Knock You Out' by LL Cool J. The engineer was taking too long and LL ran out of patience and shouted "C'mon man". It stuck and they left it in the final recording.

|-| cnu579m || 4 || At the start of [The Cure's cover of Foxy Lady](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CVw4Iy1UNc) you can hear Laurence Tolhurst ask Robert Smith "Sooty, is it two verses?". Smith answers "No, Lol, no".   
   
Not really a mistake, it's just part of some interesting banter they left in the mix as they were about to start recording. |-| 
|-| cnu5gic || 3 || In Big Brother and the Holding Company's "Turtle Blues," you can hear a wine glass breaking in the studio followed by the studio's efforts to clean it up. |-| 
|-| cnu5p2m || 3 || Every time I hear this song, I laugh thinking about the original it sampled, I Keep Forgettin' by Michael McDonald (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjqOsYRQI0o).  Michael McDonald is always hilarious. |-|

|-| cnu5u3z || 33 || I LOVE IT!!!

Could you possibly put in support for sound cloud and/or local files? Also support for existing youtube playlists would be cool.

Also, your super awesome for using material design :D

(EDIT: I see you already have support for existing playlists) |-| 
|-| cnu5uoh || 7 || Holy shit, someone actually using the PPR genre label, *and* using it correctly! Good post OP. |-| 
|-| cnu5zve || 3 || Three that I know of, and you may have to wear headphones to hear them:

Nirvana's "Francis Farmer Bean will have her revenge on Seattle", you can hear Kurt cough before it goes loud

" I scare myself" by Thomas Dolby - in the beginning beats to the songsong you can hear Thomas clear his throat

"Grand parade of lifeless packaging" by Genesis - you can hear Phil count off before the beginning chords.  |-| 
|-| cnu60wl || 5 || During the recording of "Sweet Home Alabama" By The Lynyrd Skynyrd, the boys were working late trying to get the song right but it just wouldn't come together. Frustrated, they decided to take a break and order food. Everyone ordered different food from different restaurants and the singer got some donuts.

After the break they decided to give it another go. During the recording someone sat on his donuts and around the 4:10 mark you can her him say "My donuts! Goddamn".  But it was the best version they had done so they decided to keep it.

go ahead and win yourself a beer with that bet at any southern bar. |-|

|-| cnu6m4c || 9 || Fuck that Coyote was cute as fuck |-| 
|-| cnu6nbe || 24 || Hey,

Last time I saw you posting on Reddit, I installed Streamus instantly and it's pretty much my favourite and most used Chrome extension! Really is brilliant and I love it! Can't think of anything I'd want changed though, it's perfect for me :D!

Keep it up! |-| 
|-| cnu6pql || 147 || Why would I use this over, say, Spotify? |-| 
|-| cnu6yb8 || 28 || Not many people quit their jobs to pursue their passion.  I hope you know how big your achievement is!  Congratulations and props! |-| 
|-| cnu6yck || 3 || Very cool, could you share more of your playlist? Really love these kinda chill music. |-| 
|-| cnu6zaw || 5 || Not really a fan of Blunt's music but his self-deprecating sense of humour always cracks me up. |-| 
|-| cnu72ni || 9 || This is awesome. May I just ask, how did you learn to code? I've always wanted to learn it but I don't know where to start. |-| 
|-| cnu72nt || 4 || Just hit the east side of the lbc |-|

in french, you're in a "top 40 must have extension", in a  well known hard/software forum,

just discovered it, that's fucking great, makes me think of radio.blog.club from like... 12 years back ! |-| 
|-| cnu7c41 || 3 || cte is the bees fuckin knees |-| 
|-| cnu7c94 || 7 || When it isnt actively running, will it be contributing to chrome already being a power/memory suck? Its a fantastic extension idea, Im fooling around with it now, but thats my primary concern  |-| 
|-| cnu7lgq || 5 || The ability to push whatever is streaming or in the playlist to chromecast would be great..  |-| 
|-| cnu7mus || -4 || One of the alltime greats. Also listen how he doesn't just repeat some fashion-designers name? That is called rapping
hip hop artists used to do that back in the days. |-| 
|-| cnu7nxm || -8 || Not meaning to be butthurt here, but this isnt really hip-hop. Its G-Funk, you might call a mix between funk and hiphop but its definitely not hip-hop. |-| 
|-| cnu7x6z || 3 || Any progression on making it for other browsers?

Also one of the reasons i use youtube is to get the videos on my flatscreen. Might be worth considering =) |-| 
|-| cnu7x9a || 5 || Looks awesome, definitely be using it a lot. Any chance of this becoming an android app? |-| 
|-| cnu7xf7 || 3 || The context menus seems very nice and all, but it would be nice if you could turn it off, so you can keep your context menu size to the minimum :)
(Don'n know if you already did that, just my first thought when i saw the description)
But great iniative, if I wasn't so addicted to Spotify, i would totally use your extension! Besides, most of the best remixes isn't on Spotify |-| 
|-| cnu80kb || 9 || I remember using this and seeing this when it first got published. Can't believe it's been so long already! Thanks man |-| 
|-| cnu8345 || 3 || If the link to a song gets removed or taken down, could there be a way to remember the songs that were saved once? Even if its just saving the titles to a text file locally or something? |-| 
|-| cnu85du || 4 || Off topic. Ever listen to tech house or future house? |-| 
|-| cnu87ai || 75 || Just ended my spotify subscription |-| 
|-| cnu89d2 || 4 || This video was inspired by the true story of a coyote taking a Portland train. I've loved the way modest mouse is able to demonstrate connections between us and nature using ideas like these. |-| 
|-| cnu8bee || 8 || Integrate it with chrome-cast. |-| 
|-| cnu8cly || 12 || I don't have work off and I am in America :( |-| 
|-| cnu8ddw || 20 || Brilliant man. First time hearing about this too.

Will give feedback after some time using it, but the first impression is great, everything is simple and clear. The radio function is intuitive and the explanation of the page confirmed my assumption.

EDIT: Just one question. Does it load only the audio, ie. is it using less bandwidth at the same time?

EDIT 2: And it makes a little pop-up when the songs starts showing the song name. Ooh, beautiful. 

EDIT 3: Haha, gratz on getting to front page. Seems you will get all the feedback you need! Definitely deserve it! |-| 
|-| cnu8dmc || 8 || kygo is amazing, i trust you already |-| 
|-| cnu8h26 || 3 || Pink Floyd "The Great Gig in the Sky" has a tape flutter during the last sustained piano chord that causes a very audible warble on the track.  I think the tape was sped up or something.   |-| 
|-| cnu8o17 || 5 || Any chance you could develop this for Safari? 

I know they have plugins, but they might not be as good as Chrome.  |-| 
|-| cnu8p84 || 4 || I love using streamus and I'm so happy I discovered it from your last post! No big requests here (just one more +1 for last.fm integration) but just wanted to say thank you!  |-| 
|-| cnu8tzs || 4 || Firefox pleaseeee &lt;3 |-| 
|-| cnu8zv6 || 7 || Also, I know it's against your beliefs, but if you were to make a Donations page, I think it would explode.  |-| 
|-| cnu99zh || 3 || One more thing, OP you get it. KISS.

Simple is easy. Simple hits hard. Simple Works.  |-| 
|-| cnu9c9p || 3 || How do you make money off of this? Seems like a great service  |-| 
|-| cnu9did || 3 || I remember seeing you on /r/materialdesign! Awesome design and great program! Love it.  |-| 
|-| cnu9gh9 || 4 || The thing about labour is they harp on about "lowering inequalities" but aim to do so by bringing the successful down to the level of everyone else.  |-| 
|-| cnu9jry || 3 || I'm not usually impressed by plugins, but this is god damn amazing. My only regret is I only have one upvote to give.  |-| 
|-| cnu9qee || 3 || I love it so far, I had a question about bandwidth; does it fetch only audio? Therefore reducing the bandwidth consumption since there is no video.

And again, awesome extension - good freaking job! |-| 
|-| cnu9vyn || 20 || Awesome, awesome stuff, Sean!

I'd like to pay the favor and offer you my services as a composer &amp; sound designer in case you need them for eg. some visibility video for Streamus. Free of charge!

|-| cnua6yt || 4 || Living off small contract work and savings? Thats bad juju ....on that note big risk gives big reward. ..or failure. . |-| 
|-| cnuae18 || 5 || Honestly I think I speak for everybody, but if you want to throw an ad at the bottom to start making money off this I'd be totally cool with it. You deserve it, streamus is great! |-| 
|-| cnuaj35 || 41 || Haven't used it yet, BUT:

In Germany, most music is blocked due to some "copyright" crap. We can circumvent this by using proxy add-ons, but it's quite a hassle. So if something like that is integrated, I might even make the jump from Firefox to Chrome. |-| 
|-| cnuaki9 || 4 || wtf this is perfect

Just curious, how do you make money on this? is there like a youtube like payment system for extentions where google pays? |-| 
|-| cnub24d || 3 || Great extension! I love its purpose! AND ITS SO USEFUL!

I want to pose two suggestions. I have very little coding experience so I have no idea how difficult these two suggestions will be to implement. Please forgive me.

1. I am aware you are able to assign shortcuts. I feel like pausing and un-pausing is not used commonly enough to a justify their own shortcut. Not giving it a shortcut is inconvenient when we want to pause/un-pause, so giving it a shortcut is also over kill. What I want to suggest is a double-click feature on the icon to pause/un-pause. And a triple-click to shuffle.

2. Another feature should be detecting a secondary audio stream from chrome and then muting itself respectively. Obviously I do not want it detect an audio stream outside chrome as I can see this maybe hell to implement. i.e I have Streamus running and then suddenly I want to watch a youtube video, streamus will pause itself. Then maybe un-pause itself when I stop/pause the youtube video. (This feature should be toggle-able.)

Again, I lack the time and the know-how to create this. These are just some ideas that someone with more skill can tackle ;). I feel like these are some reasonable/useful features.

Edit: After reading over it seems like I am saying, 'I want this! Someone spend their time and energy for me!. Please believe me when I say that, I feel like these suggestions would be useful for everyone. |-| 
|-| cnubb96 || 9 || What should we do if we want to make a donation to the cause? |-| 
|-| cnubfy9 || 8 || I mean it's awesome, well done and very useful, however why are you willing to quit your job, deplete your savings, and delay your retirement (by depleting your savings) just to give this away for free?

Are you hoping to sell this to a larger company? |-| 
|-| cnuccir || 812 || It is aparent to anyone who has read the comments that MeoMix is in this for the right reasons and has his mind right for this project. 

I am amazed that in this entire thread he hasn't even once mentioned that he has a [donation](https://streamus.com/#donate) page. If you have come to the same conclusions and me and will use this product, give the man his due reward. I don't donate often to projects like these, but I think he deserves it. |-|

|-| cnudva7 || 10 || You quit your job? Has Google gifted you youtube or something? Do you own the rights to millions of artists songs?

|-| cnue5l6 || 13 || Keith Moon.

[In addition to his talent as a drummer, however, Moon developed a reputation for smashing his kit on stage and destroying hotel rooms on tour.

|-| cnufvyn || 7 || Bob Dylan.  Did whatever he wanted, even though it alienated his original fan base to the point they were sending him death threats.  His music was revolutionary, he had a style all his own, and he knew how to party.

Maybe not as wild as Hendrix, the Stones, etc., but he definitely marched to the beat of his own drum, and I think that's what rock 'n roll is about. |-| 
|-| cnuh6jx || 3 || Awesome extension man! Love the UI, fits right in with the whole material design Android has at the moment. Ultimately would love Firefox support, but I'm sure you have much more pressing things going on right now, got a donation coming your way :) Keep it up! |-| 
|-| cnuh80y || 7 || Freddie Mercury. He is simply put the essence of what makes a rock star. He kept his kickass rocking attitude until the very end. |-| 
|-| cnuhpr8 || 7 || Robert Plant was a god damned rock *god.* The way he commanded the stage, I'm convinced at least half of the crowd would have killed the person standing next to them if he'd have asked.. Not even counting his and the rest of the band's escapades off-stage, I'll take Plant any day. |-| 
|-| cnuhqny || 4 || Niccolo Paganinni.  Biggest violin shredder of his time.  People thought he was possessed or made a deal with the devil or something, as no human could be *that* good.  Oh, and his name was **Pagan**nini.  Fuckin' metal. |-| 
|-| cnui9sj || 3 || Sid Vicious |-|

|-| cnuiqwx || 5 || "Diamond" David Lee Roth.

Everything the man did was to excess.  The hair, the clothes, the bravado, the women, the stage moves, the personal hobbies, the constant BS that came out of his mouth...and still does...

Look at Van Halen back in the day.  With DLR, they were THE band that other bands modeled themselves after.  When DLR left Van Halen, and Sammy Hagar joined, Van Halen became less like Van Halen and more like Journey ("Why Can't This Be Love?"  "Dreams?"  Seriously?).

DLR leaves VH, puts together a solo band with Billy Sheehan, Gregg Bissonette, AND Steve Vai...the result?  "Eat 'Em And Smile."  HOLY SHIT, what an album!  And the live show?  They blew Hagar-era VH off the stage, in my opinion (I saw DLR and VH both during this time).

The posts with Hendrix, Richards, Dylan, Mercury?  Those guys aren't rock stars...they're ICONS.  When I think "rock star," I think Diamond Dave. |-|

Same thing goes for Elbow. The Afghan Wigs had a quite fine comebackalbum last year. Mogwai has been releasing albums the last year, but I didn't quite like them like I liked(yay I'm a rapper) their earlier works. Fugazi released an album in 2011, and some demo's last year, don't know if you want that. |-|

Great riffs, heavy ass songs, and Joey back on vocals. Came out a few years ago but I almost missed it, John Bush kinda ruined Anthrax for me. |-| 
|-| cnv1as9 || 7 || Phish - Fuego |-| 
|-| cnv1kdt || 31 || Yes!! Royal blood rules! Literally every song on the album is good. He can seriously shred on the bass. And there's only two of them! Also the drummer is awesome! ð  |-| 
|-| cnv1rgk || 19 || They are a 2 piece if you didn't know, the front man plays the lead and bass on a 4-string bass guitar.
This guy does a pretty good explanation on how it's done.

|-| cnv1z72 || 12 || Gary Numan (the guy who did "Cars") became an Industrial god after ditching the mainstream and has since become one of the most influential industrial artists of the last 10 years. He just came out with a new album last year called Splinter (Songs From A Broken Mind) was released to major critical acclaim and personally I think it is excellent. Also, his previous release from 2011, Dead Son Rising, is similarly fantastic. |-|

Edit: Holy Shitsnacks! Gold and R.I.P. my poor inbox! I guess you people really liked that remix. Also, many people here are hitting the wrong reply link as I'm receiving lots of praise for Serj/SOAD's work and music, again something I'm not a part of.  |-|

|-| cnv47ek || 4 || I really love the new Pixies stuff, Indie Cindy was instantly one of my favourite songs ever!
Morrissey's new one is a great album, also the new albums from James and the Manic Street Preachers, in fact most of my favourite new music this last year has been from artists well into their second decade and beyond! |-| 
|-| cnv47oo || 8 || So glad this song has never been posted on /r/music before... |-| 
|-| cnv4cjm || 29 || It's great in France because they love all the English and American music but half the time don't know what they're singing.

Hilarious at parties to hear them singing "WHYJALEEVAKITZUPONADABLE? YAWANNYDO!" |-| 
|-| cnv4f54 || 5 || During school and college, I was placed into 1 of 2 categories (mettlers or ravers), a raver. I would never consider listening to ANY music that featured live instruments. All my musical tastes revolved around Happy Hardcore, Drum &amp; Bass, House. 
Until my brother persisted enough that I "check out this song!". This was that song and it changed my musical taste forever. 
I'm happy to hear this at any opportunity, Thank you.

God I loved this song so much. |-|

The "80s" bands:

- Rush - Clockwork Angels.
- Any new Slayer album.
- Van Halen - A different kind of truth
- The newest motorhead (I forgot what it's called, just google it...)
- AC/DC - Rock or Bust

From the 90s:

- Noel Gallagher's High flying Birds. - A simple game of genius
- Soundgarden - King Animal
- Alice in Chains - The Devil put Dinosaurs here
- Big Wreck - Ghosts (I had to throw in another Canadian band. I'm a Canadian :P )

|-| cnv6fex || 13 || Oh man Sleater Kinney just released an incredible album today. Also, while it isn't necessarily "new" Elliott Smith because he's been dead since 2003, in 2007 (I believe it was 2007) "New Moon" was released posthumously. It's a collection of songs that were recorded between 1994 - 1997 that didn't make any of his first three albums. Usually throwaway songs aren't that great, but some of Smith's best work is on that album. The thing with Smith is that he was constantly recording, not necessarily for any particular album, so each album had tons of material to choose from. In particular, check out the tracks "Go By," "Going Nowhere," "Angel in the Snow," and "Half Right" (which would be used on Heatmiser's "Mic City Sons"). |-|

|-| cnvaqbw || 3 || The most interesting concept album of all is probably Radioheads Kid A, even though it isn't what you would initially describe as a concept album. Marianne Tatom Letts wrote a very good Dissertation about that, she calls Kid A a"resistant concept album": http://www.library.utexas.edu/etd/d/2005/lettsm76116/lettsm76116.pdf

In short: Concept albums usually follow a protagonist(subject) "who undergoes some kind of dramatic action" (e.g. The Who's Tommy) or collect several songs based on one specific topic (Nick Caves Murder Ballads). On Kid A the protagonists tries to establish himself as a subject in the beginning and gets destroyed in the middle of the album. At the song "Optimistic" it gets sort of reestablished, because its eliminiation wasn't completely succesful. Coming the end of the alubm the protagonist struggles again with his manifestation as a subject until he (or she) finally kills himself in the closer "Motion Picture Soundtrack". Radiohead tried to capture the zeitgeist with all the technical developement and alienation in here and so the album can be an analogy to the society in which the subject can not find comfort to live. 

Oh and besides this story: It's an amazingly great album, one of my all time favourites!

Hope I got all the language right, kind of difficult for a german to recapitulate this in english. |-|

|-| cnvbpbp || 7 || Lupe Fiasco's The Cool.  It expounds upon the story of Michael Young History (aka The Cool) told through He Say She Say and The Cool on Lupe Fiasco's Food &amp; Liquor.  There's The Cool, who dies and comes back as a man with a right hand of bones that falls in love with The Streets, a woman with green dollar signs for eyes and a bunch of men's names tatted on her chest.  The Streets is married to The Game, a personification of Satan.  It's my favorite story told through hip hop by miles.  The story is primarily told through the aforementioned songs on Food and Liquor, and on the Cool it's mostly through The Coolest, the video for Superstar (that went over Everyone's heads), Streets on Fire, Gotta Eat, Hello/Goodbye (Uncool), The Die and (one of my favorite flows of all time) Put You On The Game, but the whole album is worth listening to as he makes references to his characters throughout. |-| 
|-| cnvbvqg || 3 || The Church - Further/Deeper - these guys have kept putting out quality albums.

|-| cnvcce2 || 6 || Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds, *Push the Sky Away*, 2013

Musically more restrained than usual but Cave's songwriting is as strong as ever and each song is compelling in its own way.

Primal Scream, *More Light*, 2013

Best known for vivid acid house album *Screamadelica*, Primal Scream released one of the most politically charged and forceful albums in years; a return to form after a few years in the wilderness.

My Bloody Valentine, *m b v*, 2013

One part classic shoegaze, one part weightless synthesizer, one part crazy experimentation; a two-decade gap is fulfilled by this album that seems equally comfortable in the future as it does in the past. Never mind *Loveless*, how will MBV follow up *m b v*? |-|

|-| cnvcib9 || 4 || U2's Songs of Innocence is actually a really good album, but unfortunately that got lost in the rage over the release method. Lyrically, it's head and shoulders above everything they've done since Achtung Baby. 

[The Crystal Ballroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3faDM1lWiHw) (a bonus track, actually) is a standout for me. Very similar sound to Roxy Music's "Love is the Drug," and the chorus is top notch. |-|

It was a little more than 7 years ago (I'm 19) and I (unusually) can still remember where I was, what I was doing, and why I was doing it. I was over at one of my new friends house for his birthday, we played Gears of War on his xbox with this song playing in the living room. I thought this song was the fucking best and they've become one of my favorite bands since then.

It's a story about an evil sorcerer that uses magic to turn a bunch of unicorns evil and cause chaos in the land of Fife. So Angus McFife decided to go kill this guy. He travels to some mountain, fighting through a bunch of goblins and trolls to get a magic hammer. Then for some reason a dragon attacks him, and McFife uses a magic spell to make the dragon good. Then he rides on the dragon and flies around killing evil stuff. At some point a princess was kidnapped and apparently McFife is looking for her. I really don't know. Then he flies to some lake or something because there's an amulet at the bottom of it that can break the unicorns out of the evil spell I think. Then he goes east to the town of Crail because the dudes that live there are badass, and I think he wants them as his army. So then he goes back to Dundee, where the unicorns first struck, and beat the shit out of them and whatever else with his hammer and dragon and whatnot. He wins, gets the princess back, and that's pretty much it. I have no idea if the unicorns survived. |-|

Didn't know the name of the tune and just hoped it would jump out at me. It never did. Eventually started wondering if I had been mistaken about it being a Deftones song at all. This is the first time in years I've heard this song, as I had given up the search. Thanks for posting this. A small weight has been lifted. |-|

|-| cnvruvj || 6 || this one + soco amaretto lime are the only two i return to from this album. theyre such great songs tho  |-| 
|-| cnvs9ty || 3 || production is flat out amazing, but honestly on some of the tracks it's a bit overpowering and/or just more interesting than her voice is. Sometimes her routine sounds a bit tired/predictable. But when it all comes together its immensely impressive and fresh WOW. so aside from some mix hiccups, I think 7.5/10. Maybe higher with time for re-listens.

EDIT: second listen, definitely growing even more on me (settling on 8/10 maybe). Her best album IMHO, really quite sad and moving ( mmmn *Black Lake* and *Family* one after another are so sad). |-| 
|-| cnvtlis || 3 || I was brought up on Supertramp's greatest hits. To this day they're the only prog band I really like. |-| 
|-| cnvuw50 || 5 || There were so many better cuts on that album though. I always thought they were underrated as makeup wearing meatheads, but LD 50 has some amazingly complex and soulful tracks on it.  |-| 
|-| cnvv3cw || 3 || I actually know the keyboardist from Men Without Hats. He's pretty cool. He's a dentist now, and has a band called Gnuman I believe.  |-|

George RR Martin stared into this video, and just had to figure out how to kill all of these people. But that the midget was kinda neat.  |-| 
|-| cnvwdvt || 13 || "Party girls don't get hurt".  I think the meaning of "Chandelier" is that she's going to drink and get drunk and desperately party like crazy to try to escape her pain, even though she knows she can only push it away for a night.  

I think it really goes well with the kind of "hurting" tone of her singing in this song.  |-| 
|-| cnvwotv || 7 || I've had this happen quite a lot. Eventually you do get lyrics that really do connect with you and are as emotional as the music is, but more often there are songs with beautiful melodies with lyrics that disappoint me.

I believe it has to do with the amount of expectations we have on the song itself that it should 'live up to'. If a song reminds us of love but has lyrics that we find out are about the songwriter's cat, it's pretty disappointing. But I usually ignore that and just interpret it however I want to. People will build something up to make things more than they are (as they should with art and music). It is just disappointing when you find out a beautiful song you heard is actually about something meaningless. But maybe there's symbols in it? Something like 1979 by Smashing Pumpkins or Debaser by Pixies can sound meaningless and stupid to some people, but be cryptic and beautiful to others. Whether it means something really personal to the songwriter and is hard for anyone else to understand is hard to tell. All we can tell is most of the time with good art there is a bigger picture behind it and it isn't under-thought as it seems. Hopefully. |-| 
|-| cnvwxit || -10 || Brand New still sucks |-| 
|-| cnvxa7h || 3 || Many songs I loved turn out to have totally mundane bits. I guess when you **can't** hear it clearly, you just expect the verses to be as good as the bit you **can** hear. 

*But* part of the reason that section is slurred and mumbled is the singer knows the poetry is a bit shit in that section... |-| 
|-| cnvxdyu || 6 || When I was a senior in high school, I ran for class secretary. I had no idea what to say during my speech, but as I drove to school, the Safety Dance came on the radio. I got on stage and belted it, and the cafeteria went wild.

A guy who had been making my life hell for the last three years came up to begrudgingly congratulate me. The girl who had turned down being my prom date asked me out. 

This was ten years ago, and it's still the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me. Thank you Men without Hats. |-| 
|-| cnvxkux || 4 || Look up the actual lyrics to Chandelier. It's sombre as hell. Basically, it's about the mentally and attitude of the stereotypical "party girls" and how self-destructive it is. And the vocals are fantastic. |-| 
|-| cnvxoa1 || 28 || This is such a great track, it's like someone told them: "Just play as fast as you physically can."  Which creates a folk song with the energy of a punk song.  |-|

[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2K6uxIFO6w)


It sounds similar, but a lot of songs are sampled from other songs. Example: [Penguin Cafe Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E3znZoFnN8) and [Avicii](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdypVdJIwm0)

|-| cnx66dr || -6 || It's just notes and progressions (frequencies) |-| 
|-| cnx6agv || 3 || The verses are kind of The Middle-ish, and only if you're really trying to hear it. Not a rip-off. |-| 
|-| cnx6h4a || 4 || Polly-Jean rocks my world, always has, always will. |-| 
|-| cnx6n18 || 8 || You're totally right. It's difficult discussing what's a rip-off and what 'takes influence' etc. and everyone is entitled to their opinion but it honestly sounds to me like they've literally listened to the song, noted how successful it was and changed just enough to package it as something new. 

Not like this is something new though... |-| 
|-| cnx73wv || 9 || The Grateful Dead |-| 
|-| cnx74p1 || 10 || The Doors |-| 
|-| cnx779w || 5 || Elvis.  |-| 
|-| cnx7r5y || 11 || In terms of influence how about Chuck Berry? |-| 
|-| cnx7scg || 7 || Miles Davis. He was pretty much responsible for fusing Jazz and Rock. So many other artists' careers exploded because of the Miles bump too.  |-|

|-| cnx91zb || 33 || The Velvet Underground. |-| 
|-| cnx9487 || 26 || The Middle uses, what, 3 chords? All Major chords, and a I-IV-V at that.

It's not like they put a trademark on the D-A-G progression at 150 bpm. |-| 
|-| cnx96fj || 7 || Black Flag?  |-| 
|-| cnx9bzb || 13 || The Ramones.  Without the Ramones, entire genres never happen.  Punk, New Wave, Grunge- one could successfully argue that without the Ramones, rock itself would never have recovered from the Disco era.
 |-| 
|-| cnx9yid || 5 || Ramones. |-|

|-| cnxe7bl || 5 || First use of distortion, hotly debated but generally considered to be either [Ike Turner's "Rocket 88"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gbfnh1oVTk0) or [Goree Carter's "Rock Awhile"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3FNLnFg6Ck).  The latter is "overdrive" (as are many other contemporary examples) while Turner's is actually a broken speaker so let the arguments ensue as to what is or is not distortion. |-|

|-| cnxez3e || 3 || Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five.  They popularized a rollicking drum-driven instrumental style mixed with distinctive vocals that became the bedrock for almost all modern pop music. |-| 
|-| cnxf330 || 5 || A couple of people have already said Bob Dylan. I would like to tag onto that the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. They were hugely influential on Dylan as well as in their own right, re-popularizing folk music in Ireland and spreading it to the United States. They are not the "most influential" but they are very influential without being widely recognized. And while they all came from Ireland, they formed the band in America (unless I'm mistaken). Even if you don't count them as American, they should be mentioned along with U2 as an influential Irish band, at the very least. |-|

Rock Spectacle added Break Your Heart which is another one of my all-timers.

I saw them play in Austin a few months ago, and they're still one of the best live shows around, even without Steven Page.

|-| cnxhjqs || 4 || One of the more masterful pieces from his later era. His voice is old and tired, but still clear. The sense of alone-ness is palpable, like the singer is reaching the end of his life, or at least the end of his interest in life. "Its not dark yet, but its getting there," seems to me that the light is fading in his life, and that its OK. Its a natural progression of life, and the singer is finally coming to terms with it. |-|

I bought Phantogram's Voices... Glorious. I was worried it wouldn't match up to "Fall in Love" but the rest of the album is pretty damn good. 

And rappers? Too many, but my main new fix is Lil Bibby. I heard Free Crack and by god it's insane. I love it, it's just great. The second one is sweet as hell too, when he drops an album, I'm copping it asap.  |-| 
|-| cnxxdrf || 3 || **Acoustic singer-songwriter** - NPR's All Songs Considered best of 2014 list turned me on to [Chris Staples'[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-KgVF3FrOY) record American Soft. I'd been turned off of dudes singing about insecurities about growing older with acoustic guitars, but this album won me over immediately and powerfully. |-| 
|-| cnxxene || 10 || the hotelier. i've been trying to get back into the kind of music i listened to when i was in middle school. this band is new but hits all the right buttons in terms of nostalgia. [this live performance convinced me they are worth listening to.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prp78ypkQzY)  |-| 
|-| cnxxf1e || 4 || Bear Hands album Distraction has been on repeat in my car for a good month now.  |-| 
|-| cnxxiee || 5 || My favorite albums of 2014 that I immediately fell in love with were:
Real Estate: Atlas
The War On Drugs: Lost in the Dream
Craft Spells: Nausea 

Bonus: Washed Out: Paracosm (from 2013) |-| 
|-| cnxxitk || 11 || Royal Blood fucking rocks. |-| 
|-| cnxxtqz || 8 || New bands I like:  
  
[Tahuna Breaks  (Funk/Nu Disco)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbG9EH-LK5I)  
  
[Black River Drive (Rock)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QusrWS834Ss)

|-| cnxy4zd || 7 || Mine hasn't been a band, it's been a label.  That label is [Soul Jazz Records.](http://www.souljazzrecords.co.uk/)  

Basically they put together genre, location and time specific compilations.  For example **Deutsche Electronische Muzik** is a compilation of experimental German electronic and Rock Musik make between 1971 and 1983.  

There are no "hits" in any of their albums, but that is not a bad thing, it's a positive.  The albums are a wonderful journey of learning and exploration and they have been curated to such a high standard that all the tracks are gems.  

Really worth checking out if you fancy some older stuff, or doing a bit of learning and exploration.  Genres range from Krautrock, to Gospel, Soul, early Hip Hop, Chicago house, Acid house, Funk, Disco, blues and more.  

Awesome label.   |-| 
|-| cnxy6ae || 9 || Mac Demarco.  [Annie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TigJYxitYLg) is a great song, [Blue Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR_R1kt4V54) was posted on Reddit a little while ago.  [Ode to Viceroy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bfTTeZOrs4) is probably his most popular, though.  [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgmigN_rWxE) is probably my favourite song of his.  I don't just like his music, he seems like a really chill guy too. |-| 
|-| cnxzmxd || 3 || [Dry The River - Alarms In The Heart](http://youtu.be/LolR9J-SWCs)      
Great English alt-rock band of the same ilk as Dredg and The Antlers.  |-| 
|-| cnxzqqn || 3 || Just found out Bombay Bicycle Club exists. Really surprised I didn't listen to them earlier, cause they're great. |-| 
|-| cnxzxhv || 3 || James Blake -- [Retrograde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p6PcFFUm5I)

Also, Active Child -- [Hanging On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCB6D61LSCs) |-| 
|-| cny08op || 3 || Can't get enough of [Prime by Allie X](https://soundcloud.com/alliexandra/prime). I bet she's the breakout pop star of 2015. Like Lady Gaga x CHVRCHES x Lana Del Ray x Charli XCX. Except she is stranger and writes a more aggressive kind of pop than any of them. 

Also check out the disturbing as fuck video for her first song, Catch. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOKsdQm0JFo
 |-| 
|-| cny1vcc || 4 || Todd Terje and his latest album *It's Album Time*. Fantastic nu-disco style music that is very reminiscent of music from the 80s, particularly the synth-heavy electronic music from Miami Vice. Here's the [song that got me into his music](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LUOIvT9hzD8) |-|

|-| cny2tb5 || 3 || Not sure if this counts, but the How to Train Your Dragon soundtracks by John Powell. Recently watched the movies for the first time in awhile, and I had completely forgotten just how beautiful the music was for those movies. Especially [this song]( http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rY07_dX3F88). |-| 
|-| cny45xx || 3 || you say they "sync perfectly" yet you never define what syncing perfectly means. Obviously audio and video is gonna sync more often than not. Both media don't compete with the same sense. It's like being amazed why there's barely any car vs plane collision even though they're going to the same place.

Also you seem to have 0 knowledge of music composition. What does sync mean to you? Do you know what a downbeat is? Can you tell which section of the song is a pre chorus, how the verses divide into AB forms? I doubt it, so how do you know that they perfectly sync? You don't. |-| 
|-| cny51ef || 3 || Music follows formulas, which are all reused a lot  |-| 
|-| co0uokg || 92 || So happy Sticky Fingers made it twice already |-|

|-| co14h1e || 358 || Nice try Wikipedia http://i.imgur.com/tXFZyp9.png |-| 
|-| co0ypj6 || 57 || Really appreciating the love for RÃ¶yksopp. |-| 
|-| co12c0h || 181 || The top of the list is gonna be so Chet Faker heavy, nothing yet as of #28 |-| 
|-| co11lr2 || 87 || I'm glad Gambino and Kendrick made it on the list! Even though they're not in the top 50, it's awesome seeing positive feedback from their new stuff.

Edit: well, I spoke too soon! |-| 
|-| co0xg2d || 95 || Shit, Smith Street finally made it. |-| 
|-| co12k54 || 707 || My reaction the last couple of years - 

http://i.imgur.com/WquK4ZB.jpg |-| 
|-| co13itn || 29 || I wanna turn this top 100 inside out and lick it like a crisp packet |-| 
|-| co14ghc || 47 || They should've played *Shake It Off* for #1 as a joke (and then cut it off after 20 seconds or so) |-| 
|-| co0yxm2 || 109 || * Wishlist: Anything from Turn Blue by The Black Keys (my personal AOTY); Anything from DFA1979; Fall in Love by Phantogram; Coronus the Terminator by Flying Lotus.
* Good to see Childish make it, Because The Internet was a solid project that had a lot of passion behind it. 
* Needs more Run The Jewels, as does anything else. 

Edit- Reggie Watts can legitimately sing. Holy hell. 

Edit 2- if anyone has a link to the 200-101 list, hook me up. Tried looking for it earlier with no luck. |-| 
|-| co122he || 24 || I am so out of touch. I don't know ANYTHING from this list. 
On the flipside...some great sounding stuff here so I'm going to use it to investigate some new music !  |-| 
|-| co12ebd || 59 || I recognized 6 of them

I must be really out of touch or really old. Possibly a combination of the 2.  

Edit: Im NZ not USA I assume we get a bit of Aus music here, dunno. I have no idea what these crazy kids listen to here either |-| 
|-| co14gry || 34 || Was that I'm gonna let you finish a subtle dig at Taylor Swift?  |-| 
|-| co0zjxz || 18 || CLPPNG getting the nod(with one of the weaker songs on the album in my opinion) is pretty great. Not something I'd ever expect from a state side poll. |-| 
|-| co11vd1 || 19 || I voted for Everything Is Shit Except My Friendship With You, so I'm happy. |-| 
|-| co13nb2 || 16 || that Tswizzle banter |-| 
|-| co13yvi || 17 || Top ten is Chets ten.  |-| 
|-| co149b0 || 17 || Stolen Dance is a feel good song
I cant be sad listening to this |-| 
|-| co10ag8 || 16 || I'm happy Happy Idiot made top 100 :D
Just waiting for The Delta Riggs - Supersonic Casualties! |-| 
|-| co12cqy || 14 || So glad BANKS did well, she has some awesome music, surprised she actually got this far because I didnt really hear her much this year.  |-| 
|-| co11ghp || 38 || I hope northlane gets up on it rot was awesome #strayadaycunt |-| 
|-| co148pr || 13 || Radio interview 101: lower the darn volume of your speakers! |-| 
|-| co0ypg8 || 73 || Pleased to see Chvrches up here, every single they put out is pure gold. |-| 
|-| co135kw || 43 || I have no idea what this is, or what/who 9/10ths of these songs are. 

But I'll be damned if I don't make a playlist of all of them and put it on my iPod tomorrow.  |-| 
|-| co0zy2y || 23 || Goddamn I hope something by Mac Demarco makes it in. That'll make up for last year when 'Freaking Out the Neighborhood' (the album came out in 2012 but the song was eligible in 2013) didn't even make it between 101-200 (yes they do that now too)  
Edit: Top 40 now and nothing. Starting to lose hope now  
Edit 2: Well, bring on numbers 101-200 then! |-| 
|-| co13qi3 || 11 || woah, Faded not in top ten, gotta be a surprise |-| 
|-| co11bua || 9 || Cant believe Flume's remix of Lorde, Grandma's Hands and Carmada are so low |-| 
|-| co11zd8 || 11 || Am I the only one who is hoping Peking Duk doesn't get the top spot? |-| 
|-| co13sqp || 10 || Expect to see these ones in top ten. 6 of them are pretty 100% locked in

* Peking Duk - High

* Milky Chance - Stolen Dance 

* Chet Faker - Talk is cheap

* Sia - Chandelier

* Chet Faker - Gold

* Chet Faker - 1998 

* Hilltop Hoods - Cosby Sweater

* Mark ronson - uptown funk
 |-| 
|-| co1495a || 11 || Gotta love the accidental fuck word :p |-| 
|-| co10i6r || 10 || Wow, thought Two Weeks would go in higher than 45. |-| 
|-| co12j1i || 9 || Glad to see Banks on there |-| 
|-| co1491s || 9 || Whoops! |-| 
|-| co133jn || 37 || Am I the only one that's ecstatic to see The Amity Affliction get a song so high? Well it may not be the 'best' the Australian heavy scene has to offer, it's amazing to hear it on the radio! |-| 
|-| co12p52 || 26 || Future Islands, fuck yeah |-| 
|-| co14p9u || 17 || There were a lot of artists that were not included in this years countdown. Royal Blood, Dan Sultan, The Black Keys, Kimbra and Foster The People come to mind.

I can't help but wonder if the Taylor Swift situation prevented other artists from being included in the Hottest 100. It was widely known that thousands of people were voting for her, so people gave their votes to the artists that were already favoured to win in the event they did include her in the countdown. 

There were so many people trying to get her to number 1, it kind of makes sense that there would be just as many trying to keep her down on the list. 

But that's just a thought, maybe people just didn't like what these artists released this year. I'd love to get some opinions on this...  |-| 
|-| co13jbc || 17 || 3 entries from alt-J! Fuck yeah. |-| 
|-| co12i13 || 8 || Hunger of the Pine is definitely a great one, one of my favorites from the new Alt-J album.  |-| 
|-| co13h6z || 9 || Until today I had no idea people actually liked Alt-J. Good to see The Kite String Tangle up there though. |-| 
|-| co13q5q || 8 || FAAADDED |-| 
|-| co143q7 || 8 || There's Uptown Funk. |-| 
|-| co11f5n || 47 || Oh God, do not open this post from front page if you have RES. 60 (and going up) Youtube videos trying to load at once. |-| 
|-| co14eca || 14 || Grats on #1 Chet! Big question is now do Triple J do a fake out with Taylor Swift or just shake it off. |-| 
|-| co149do || 7 || Stolen Dance fuck yeah!! |-| 
|-| co14gyi || 7 || I was really worried that Taylor Swift would be #1 and Triple J was fucking with us the whole time... Glad it's Chet Faker :) |-| 
|-| co12y3y || 15 || Big ones still to come in top 20: 

* Peking Duk - High

* Milky Chance - Stolen Dance 

* Chet Faker - Talk is cheap

* Sia - Chandelier

* Illy - Tightrope

* Chet Faker - Gold

* Chet Faker - ~~1989~~ 1998 

* ~~Childish Gambino - 3005~~ not even this year, rookie

* Sticky Fingers - Gold Snafu

* Hilltop Hoods - Cosby Sweater

Edit: Really hope this isn't but 

* Mark ronson - uptown funk

Edit 2: Forgot about alt-J da boiz

* Alt-J - Left Hand Free

* Alt-J - Every other freckle(Probably not)

top twenty will be fun!!  |-| 
|-| co13xub || 27 || Fuck yeah I love Sia. |-| 
|-| co12vgq || 8 || CAUSE IVE BEEN WAITING ON YOUOUOUUUUUU |-| 
|-| co13ldn || 6 || Great, another ~~Ed Sheeran~~ ~~George Ezra~~ ~~Passenger~~ Vance Joy song for my dad to hum the chorus of until Australia Day next year. At least there's no ukulele in this one, I suppose. |-| 
|-| co13q8x || 6 || 3 Alt-J songs?!?!?! So happy right now |-| 
|-| co13qpm || 6 || I'm in the US so I don't listen to this station, but I love so many of the choices on here! Chvrches, Robyn &amp; Royksopp, First Aid Kit, TVOTR, and Jack White are all personal favorites, and Alt-J is catchy as hell. Definitely curious as to what the top ten will be.  |-| 
|-| co1421g || 6 || Chet coming only from my left headset speaker is driving me mad hahahah

Edit: wooo stereo! |-| 
|-| co16us5 || 6 || Did anyone else sense a real lack of diversity in this year's one? At a rough count, there were 28 songs in there from the same artists. Is it wrong to want a one-song rule to allow more bands a chance and more of a cross-section of what Australian audiences are actually listening to? |-| 
|-| co133jj || 11 || Wow. I listened to a couple of The Preatures' (#29) songs... They're quite nice and catchy. Sort of "poppy" in approach, but really neat things instrumentally going on, too. 

I also listened to **[this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxh7Qilsnz0)** and **[this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtDXezAhes8)**

Plus, the lead singer Izzi Manfredi is really, really pretty. |-| 
|-| co0x6lr || 6 || Any predictions for #1? |-| 
|-| co0zxvu || 5 || Surely, Happy Idiot should be higher than 49!!! Common Australia! Don't let me down! |-| 
|-| co11r9s || 5 || Great seeing the Hilltop Hoods getting recognition for a very well done album. I'm hoping Cosby Sweater gets top 10!

Also loving the Run the Jewels on here! |-| 
|-| co12znc || 6 || Love a bitta Sticky! |-| 
|-| co13eyl || 5 || MORE STICKY FINGERS!! |-| 
|-| co1427g || 5 || All hail the king.  |-| 
|-| co1456f || 5 || The announcers stated that had t swift been in it, Shake it off would be at #12 |-| 
|-| co146a5 || 6 || Despite a few, I just want to thank all of you guys for being so rad. Good discussion on good music, can't get better! |-| 
|-| co146u3 || 5 || It seems many people only read the artist column haha.  

2 songs in the top 5 without an album? That's fucking impressive. |-| 
|-| co147ku || 5 || If Taylor Swift had made it in, [it would have hit number 12](http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/taylor-swift-disqualified-from-hottest-100/story-fnndfy6b-1227196860796).

...and so far, my highest pick has been #21, followed by #50. Not one of my better years for picking, it would seem. |-| 
|-| co14dlu || 4 || I'm so glad to see The Amity Affliction on this list |-| 
|-| co14eec || 5 || 3 songs by one Artist in the top 10 must be a record? |-| 
|-| co14fjb || 6 || Fuck yes, Chet has it for sure now! Well done to Peking Duk and all the other Aussie bands. I know it is the beers talking but I love Australia Day,  such a fantastic day, countdown, Radio station and group of fellow Aussies. |-| 
|-| co14gbw || 16 || HAHAHA "Ima let you finish but..." So subtle, so good. WP JJJ |-| 
|-| co13p8p || 9 || GLASS ANIMALS! Hyped on this top 25 so far man, and I can't wait to see them at Coachella. |-| 
|-| co14gwj || 9 || Fun fact: Chet Faker and Vance Joy went to the same school! |-| 
|-| co11uxv || 4 || Wish RTJ had done a bit better, but good to see them getting some attention in Australia! |-| 
|-| co12h55 || 5 || Top 3 have got to be Stolen Dance, Talk is Cheap and High, in any order.  |-| 
|-| co12z84 || 5 || I thought that "Business Time" was number 20 - got very excited for a second there. |-| 
|-| co137cc || 4 || I love Lorde, but Yellow Flicker Beats? Seriously? |-| 
|-| co13blq || 4 || Illy's Tightrope sounds different???? |-| 
|-| co13i6o || 4 || Awesome to see clipping. on that list. Those guys are amazing.  |-| 
|-| co13kdk || 4 || Glad to see TKST up there. Vessel was such a great album all around. |-| 
|-| co13vjy || 4 || Alt-J - Every Other Freckle #14? How did the lyric 'turn you inside out and lick you like a crisp packet' not make it into the top 10... |-| 
|-| co142b5 || 4 || Godamn this is so hot  |-| 
|-| co146w7 || 3 || Woo Peking Duk! Calling it now, High has got to be number 1. Get ready for a crazy international year in 2015 Peking Duk.

Edit: Changed that guess to Chet Faker |-| 
|-| co14e8m || 4 || I get to keep mah hairs! Happy Australia Day, and goodnight to my fellow Americans still awake for the love of music! |-| 
|-| co16lzk || 4 || I must live under a rock, I've never heard of nearly any of these artists. Perhaps I should broaden my listening range |-| 
|-| co10fmc || 11 || Busy Earnin' at 67? You should be ashamed, Australia.  

My smokey's still Gold Snafu by Sticky Fingers. |-| 
|-| co13bnv || 9 || Left Hand Free hypeeee

Edit: EOF only 14? disappointing

also, deBOO |-| 
|-| co13kxc || 8 || Here's to Hosier "Take me to church" and Hilltop Hoods "Crosby sweater" in top ten! |-| 
|-| co1442o || 6 || Oh god, still no Mark Ronson. I mean i don't mind the song and it should be up there but not #1

Edit: Thank fuck |-| 
|-| co14bfq || 7 || How and why is Hilltop hoods at #3.

EDIT: I should note that i don't hate them. It's just quite unexpected for me. I would have expected them earlier in the hottest 100. |-| 
|-| co10m6o || 4 || Yes Flashed Junk Mind made it! This song makes me happy the moment it comes on.  |-| 
|-| co11zjh || 3 || Really pleased SAFIA managed to make it onto the list. Not my favorite song by them, but definitely pleased they are getting some more exposure. |-|

|-| co1495z || 3 || I don't mind this |-| 
|-| co14y35 || 4 || As someone who listens to primarily Alt Nation when in the car, I find this list pleasing to my tastes and expectations. |-| 
|-| co15jyf || 3 || I know some of these bands!

I mean like 5, but still.... |-| 
|-| co1dmp7 || 3 || Damnit i thought it said Triple H |-| 
|-| co144mq || 7 || Goddam Chet Faker is beautiful! He's still got one song left and he is dominating the hottest 100. Love seeing good Aussie music spread around the world. Gonna be a good contest for number one spot. Happy Australia Day / Triple J Day everyone!
 |-| 
|-| co133e7 || 5 || There'd have to be some Royal Blood coming. |-| 
|-| co14c4e || 5 || Still hoping For a Dillon Francis song..... |-|

 |-| 
|-| co14g7h || 3 || Congrats Chet!!!!!!!! |-| 
|-| co14ylp || 3 || I'm only 25, but I must be really out of touch. 

In 100 songs, I recognized only 5 artists in this list: Royksopp (though not Robyn), Foo Fighters, Lorde, Jack White, and Lana del Ray. Only know Lana del Ray because of a song she did for Great Gatsby and Lorde because of her breakout song I can never remember the name of. Of the 2 songs I actually recognized (Something From Nothing and Lazaretto), I think only Lazaretto might be included in my personal top 100 of 2014.

So either I am out of touch or this just is not the type of music I listen to. Also, I get the feeling this list was hyped up out of control the last two weeks for no good reason. |-| 
|-| co147lu || 4 || Cosby Sweater number 4 |-| 
|-| co10s5a || 7 || JJJ banned Taylor Swift being included (from a fantastic online part serious, part trolling campaign). 

Some guy has formally lodged a Freedom of Information request surrounding the process.

|-| co13m79 || 5 || I love cake so much. The songs are like math. All of the parts are perfect, and they are the perfect parts at the perfect time. So precise. Any little changes and the song wouldn't be nearly as cool. The more I listen, the more I love them.  |-|

|-| co154mk || 8 || Based on the title I thought this was bullshit. Then I played them side by side and realized not only do they use the same progression, albeit different tempo, but subconsciously I had always thought it was similar to another song although I couldn't identify that song until now. |-|

Overlap / Mashup |-| 
|-| co1474g || 43 || The similarity between the two songs owes a lot to the fact that Tom Petty's song has a really simple melody and chord progression to begin with.  As a musician and composer, I'll say that the style and pacing of Smith's song seems different enough from Petty's work that it wouldn't really merit a legal judgment.  

Smith probably would have gotten away with it if he had just done the song in a different key -- or given that it's a 3-2-1 melody (1 being the root of the opening chord and key of the song itself) he could have just varied the melody a bit and he would have been in the clear. |-| 
|-| co13eje || 16 || He told them that he wouldn't back down on the lawsuit..... |-| 
|-| co0zj83 || 9 || It's cool how they sorted it out without too much fuss.  |-| 
|-| co15rcq || 13 || I don't think it was on purpose. So many things in music are subconsciously copied, or even just a pure coincidence. |-| 
|-| co12hjs || 39 || I guess they sort of sound similar but it seems crazy to me that he gets awarded royalties for it. There's tons of songs with similar guitar riffs/melodies/chord progressions etc. How are people not getting sued left and right? |-| 
|-| co13ogp || 9 || Now we need Bowie to get paid by Alesso for Heroes.  |-| 
|-| co12jw5 || 20 || I bet Sam Smith is singing and crying about it at the hairdresser asking for his usual Kim Jong Un haircut.  |-| 
|-| co1acpi || 3 || Awesome! Now if Jeff Lynne could get some royalties for Green Day ripping off Telephone Line I would be truly happy. |-| 
|-| co1dohg || 4 || "Not previously familiar with the 1989 Petty/Lynne song, the writers of âStay With Meâ listened to âI Wonât Back Downâ and acknowledged the similarity."


Not previously familiar?  You're a *professional* songwriter or professional *anything* in the music industry and you're *not previously familiar* with Tom Petty?  Bullshit. |-| 
|-| co1e5kf || 4 || You mean Jeff Lynne.  Look who's listed first.

Yes, that Jeff Lynne.

Producer with 3 of the top 5 albums on the charts at one point.  Composer of Xanadu.  Electric Light Orchestra (the band that did Mr. Blue Sky for all you youngsters).  and of course, Homer's favorite Wilbury...

Season 14, "The Dad Who Knew Too Little" |-| 
|-| co124y4 || 11 || Can someone explain the similarities between the two? I just don't freaking hear it. What am I missing? |-| 
|-| co12f6q || 7 || Coldplay could learn a thing or two from Sam Smith |-| 
|-| co1az7t || 4 || Oh sure - this gets caught, but Dave Ghrol rips off Dio and no one bats an eye.  |-| 
|-| co13r13 || 6 || Well yes, it is the same melody but it's a bloody simple, obvious chord pattern, and a simple, obvious melody.  Seems a bit petty (Hah) to try and grab some songwriting royalties. 
 |-| 
|-| co1647h || 4 || They're alike, alright, but this is just silly. You can't copyright a simple melody out of context, or at least you shouldn't be able to.  |-| 
|-| co16kv6 || 3 || This seems like a very slippery legal slope.  |-| 
|-| co13wi2 || -12 || I hear it but what a dick move on Petty's part. I wanna say it was petty of him, but I didn't wanna make that pun. Oh,wait... |-| 
|-| co1ewcj || 138 || Really, the Dropkick Murphy's aren't a recognizable enough name? We have to go with the vague and generic "Celtic punk band?"  |-| 
|-| co1b80q || 93 || I mean seriously, I don't understand why every person of Irish descent regardless of ideology feels the need to love the Murphs. They're a punk band- literally the polar opposite of conservatism. Not only that, but the original Irish immigrants were entirely lower class and only rose up once they were unionized, so it's awfully ironic how an ancestral Irishman could be anti-union. |-| 
|-| co19erj || 20 || Bruce Springsteen feels the same way about Chris Christie.

|-| co1f7p8 || 4 || Ken Casey of the Murphys, a Democrat, also stumped for Massachusetts' new Republican governor, and they played at an inauguration event for him, [for context](http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/2015/01/06/dropkick-murphys-will-play-charlie-baker-event-friday-because-course-they-will/4ZGqzjxWvjwMPlsmyOlq0H/story.html). They are solidly pro-Union, however, which is probably where a lot of the literal hate comes from. |-| 
|-| co1aw6j || 9 || "We can't even right now" |-| 
|-| co1f7tt || 4 || The song he was using was written by Woody Guthrie. How culturally ignorant is this union-busting governor that he would even consider using a song by Guthrie?  |-| 
|-| co1dj7p || 13 || I'm a huge Dropkick fan AND live in Wisconsin. It's no secret that Dropkick is massively pro-union/working class. Walker proves again how much of a fucking idiot he and his campaign runners are. "We literally hate you... Love, Dropkick Murphy's" lol, this is why I love them. |-| 
|-| co1fgic || 4 || Why couldn't they just put "Dropkick Murphys" in the title instead of doing the whole fucking click-bait thing? God damn I hate that. |-| 
|-| co1em2d || 8 || Still not as funny as Paul Ryan saying he is a huge Rage Against the Machine fan.  Do these guys even try to interpret the lyrics? |-|

|-| co1c1hj || -6 || I don't listen to the Murphs much but knowing this I'll definitely have to support them more |-| 
|-| co1ev7r || -5 || Republicans do this all the time. It's almost like they feel that the copyright laws that they so stridently argue for in defense of their corporate overlords (or maybe any laws at all) don't apply to THEM of course. |-| 
|-| co1e35f || -15 || I've always thought it's incredibly immature and whiny for bands to bitch about stuff like this.

Edit:  I'm assuming you all are super supportive of any baker or photographer not wanting to be personally involved with a homosexual wedding for religious reasons.  Got it.  

Edit 2:  The creators are even more removed from their art in this respect, since they've already sold it down the line to a record label who (as far as I know) can sell it at whim.  It would be like a wedding cake bakery selling to a wedding planning company, and THEN complaining about use.   |-|

|-| co12046 || 4 || Inertiatic ESP ftw |-| 
|-| co12ehu || 4 || De-Loused makes a great soundtrack to just about anything. It's always my go-to for long distance runs and Televators is one of the few songs on the album I get to rest to. Maybe just another reason why I love it! |-| 
|-| co133em || 3 || Now I have to listen to the whole album. Best way to listen to Mars Volta. |-| 
|-| co124cy || -12 || this music sucks a dog's dick |-| 
|-| co12e34 || 7 || http://youtu.be/bLBSoC_2IY8 |-| 
|-| co14f1l || 8 || Music nerds: this song was written with Pachelbel's Canon in D as its framework. |-| 
|-| co13626 || 16 || I've always liked the lyrical concept of this song.

It's a song about how lyrics are pointless and have nothing to do with what makes a song catchy, illustrated with pointless lyrics, and a chorus which IS the hook. It ends up being a song about itself.

Meta. |-| 
|-| co10lmi || 6 || gotta love John popper am I right  |-| 
|-| co0yyw7 || 4 || So good..  They've changed so much and I wish they'd held onto some of their experimental indie pop tendencies.  |-| 
|-| co10qfy || 3 || That was the first song of theirs I ever heard. Probably considered douchey on reddit but....It played at the end of an Entourage episode and I immediately had to look it up. |-|

The volume is in proportion to how hard you slide it.  I also put up a [wiki](http://exertion.pbworks.com) on how to design and build them yourself. |-|

|-| co0vwfv || 5 || [Roy "Future Man" Wooten](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Man) from Bela Fleck and the Flecktones invented the Drumitar. Although there is only one original Drumitar, it was eventually improved into what is called the [Zendrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendrum). It's exactly what it sounds like; a synth drum kit shaped like a guitar.

He also invented a weird instrument called the [Roy-El](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/30/50716149_4120fb936c.jpg) which I can't find any video of him playing it. It's basically a keyboard that plays all sorts of weird notes and sounds that you don't really hear anywhere else. I know that just sounds like a synthesizer but it's different and hard to explain. I saw them live and he did a solo on it and it was strange but very interesting.

 |-| 
|-| co0w26f || 5 || Though they don't make it anymore, the Moog guitar is pretty nifty. It has the ability to either sustain or "mute" the notes with the magnetic field of the pickups.

|-| co1dljv || 3 || I'm loving this "official lyric video" trend. I love lyric videos, but so many of them are so aesthetically unappealing. This is so beautiful! 

Edit: A few of my other favorites: [Dirty Paws by Of Monsters and Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCHUw7ACS8o) and [Gooey by Glass Animals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGIS8npb5GQ).  |-|

|-| co1di5e || 3 || Had no idea there was so much C&amp;K hate -- I actually really enjoyed that album. So far, this sounds really good! Hopefully it holds up after a few more playthroughs.

Edit: okay, so I've had a few more listens. Really digging the mellow, driving beat. the only thing that kind of puts me off is the intro of the fuzz around 3:15. it seems to resolve too quickly, almost like a tease. personally, I would have preferred it to make a reappearance at the end and the song kind of fade/end in more fuzz. tbf, that's not really their style, but I would have liked to have seen that element to make another appearance. I'll wait to hear the rest of the album to see how it all ties in, but overall, pretty good! |-| 
|-| co1e4vp || 5 || I've always been pretty convinced that Ben Gibbard's songwriting is significantly better when he's sad.  That's why Codes and Keys, although it wasn't *bad*, definitely didn't feel the same as the rest of Death Cab's work.  Listening to the lyrics of this song, it seems pretty clear that it's about his divorce from Zooey Deschanel.

Basically, Ben Gibbard needs to be in a constant state of heartbreak, so that the rest of us can enjoy his music. |-|

|-| co0qhzw || 4 || For different kinds of hardcore I believe Botch, The Dillinger Escape Plan, The Blood Brothers, At The Drive-In, Maximum The Hormone are some of the best bands. 

As far as metal goes, I used to be in love with the likes of Gojira, Meshuggah, Isis, Opeth, Strapping Young Lad and similar bands in prog and post metal back in my \m/ \m/ days.

Right now I am chilling to [The Greatest by Cat Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQLfPwAxUPQ). |-|

Many differences but they're so great :3 |-|

|-| co0orbm || 3 || Bring me the horizon- Drown (2014) 
I love this song.  |-| 
|-| co0ov15 || 3 || The Avalanches' *Since I Left You* is incredible. Two standout tracks, to me, are [the title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpqm-05R2Jk) and [Frontier Psychiatrist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLrnkK2YEcE). It's a great record made entirely, if memory serves, of samples - something like thirty-five hundred or something like that. Can't recommend it enough. |-| 
|-| co1aimo || 6 || * Song for the Dumped, Ben Folds Five
* Go Your Own Way, Fleetwood Mac

|-| co0utip || 3 || The guy on the right at [2:25](http://youtu.be/bDbpzjbXUZI?t=2m25s) was feeling it too much. |-| 
|-| co15uxa || 3 || When this song plays on GTA the streets run red with blood.  I don't know what it is but as soon as it hits I just start throwing sticky bombs and go full retard. |-| 
|-| co180hw || 3 || Rick James hair makes that video. |-| 
|-| co0hm2e || 3 || Because when the band's lead singer hung himself from chronic depression the band decided to rename itself and go from a deep grungy rock band to this fucking immense comeback that encapsulates the ENTIRE emotional spectrum of going through a process of coping with the grief of their lost friend.


This the kind of thing I go full Patrick Bateman on listening to.
You deserve to hear this band if you have never done so. |-| 
|-| cobtakp || 349 || Remember when everyone hated vevo because it had ads.. good times |-| 
|-| cobquo8 || 67 || Well that's messed up, but not surprising, especially given the leverage youtube has. |-| 
|-| cobt824 || 186 || It's so sad what youtube has become.  I remember when it was the best place to put things.

gg google you were the chosen one |-| 
|-| cobttq3 || 40 || Not surprised because we gave youtube to much control over our media. The music industry has always been kinda shady and shitty. |-| 
|-| cobvai7 || 75 || What happened to Google and their motto "do no evil"? |-| 
|-| cobtiw1 || 50 || I don't understand why artists and musicians take such a hit now in modern times, particularly in the realm of the digital music industry. 

It adds a lot more pressure on the artists who are already under a lot of scrutiny from countless factors, let alone being a prisoner of their own minds. 

I dream of a day where artists and musicians are respected and viewed as a resource from the companies who are being made by the very same people they're taking advantage of.  |-| 
|-| cobve64 || 59 || Maybe we need a new YouTube. This one seems broken.  |-| 
|-| cobtcxd || 53 || Youtube is owned by Google and I thought they had a do-no-evil policy or something
huh |-| 
|-| cobx70b || 18 || This is depressing.  We keep squeezing and squeezing artists out of work, and then we complain that pop-culture is shit.  How are artists - working in any medium - supposed to make a living?  I'm oversimplifying the matter, but I feel like that's what's at the heart of it. |-| 
|-| cobujqz || 62 || I wish more people used Vimeo. I love product they put out and am on there constantly to watch wakeskating videos. It's just a better place to watch videos because the quality is higher and there are less asshole members/commenters. |-| 
|-| cobxqv1 || 8 || So, media corporations don't have to pay the artist to use her music for their own profit, and they can even stop her from earning money herself, and even distributing her own music. No contract, no agreement, no consent needed. But if *I*, in the privacy of my own home, decide to listen to her music without paying the corporation, then *I* am the criminal, and *I* am the immoral sonofabitch who takes the bread out of the artists mouth. |-| 
|-| cobucvq || 21 || This is downright terrifying, and should open a lot of discussion |-| 
|-| cobw5ww || 9 || One has to question the mentality of a company doing questionable things and trying to force journalists to cover it up.

"Yeah you figured out we're being evil but plz don't tell anyone kthx" |-| 
|-| cobxzy7 || 8 || Google, from "don't be evil" to "let's build military robots and prevent art distribution" |-| 
|-| cobxz3h || 3 || We need to break this illusion of independant corporations and start naming them by the major entity that owns them.

This isn't YOUTUBE. it's GOOGLE.  |-| 
|-| cobvncf || 6 || terrible. Soundcloud maybe? |-| 
|-| cobxjcx || 10 || The headline is bogus, Google "*contacts journalists and tries to force them to change headlines about this issue*", did they read their own article? Their example was of google contacting press, discussing the details, &amp; asking them to change their headlines... what an evil corporation! ^[*Re-worded] 

Rather than repeating the sympathy plight of the lonely musician, why don't they post the details of the proposed contract? The article didn't mention anything that was terrible from what I read, they said they wanted her to release her new songs on their service when they come out and that this would be a 5 year contract, oh the suffering? Or they would remove her ability to selectively monetize her recordings, which sounds to me like they are saying she would lose her special right to use their ContentID service.

If I am wrong then please say so, what have i misunderstood? Regardless of the facts, this article is clickbait and bias reporting at its best. Youtube is extremely popular and it's ability to control music content is concerning, but that doesn't make them evil in itself and they are far from being a monopoly in either streaming services or the music content industry.  |-| 
|-| cobwtn3 || 3 || Any idea how this affects smaller, just starting out indie artists? I was going to throw a couple of my songs up on YouTube but now I'm starting to think Soundcloud is pretty much my only option. |-| 
|-| cobw27y || 3 || How the fuck is this legal? |-| 
|-| coby2zk || 3 || Wait... so you want access to the massive consumer base of youtube.  You want the infrastructure and unfathomable upload bandwidth.  You want the reliability to know that your music is available across countless devices, automatically adjusting for the device and bandwidth of the connection.

You want people to stumble upon you digitally rather than by you making the rounds from gig to gig and doing all that physical legwork.

And you bitch and moan about the companies that make that all possible 'exploiting' YOU?

Look, I get it, producing something with artistic value isn't free.  An artist has value and needs compensation.  But this isn't google, pandora, or whatever being evil, this is a business that has massive overhead ensuring it has a sustainable business model. |-| 
|-| cobx9xz || 3 || So if she doesn't sign the contract, her songs are used anyway? 

Can't she just say no and then sue youtube for copyright infringement? (if she can't already sue youtube for blackmailing, that is)  |-| 
|-| cobtup6 || -11 || well i say fuck you to every person who kept telling me google+ integration was for our benefit. seriously the people i hate the most in the world are the ones who speak for the company while others around them are complaining. this sort of feels like the gamergate thing when feminists teamed up with the media journalists that were being fought to undermine gamers with whisper campaigns |-| 
|-| cobx38w || -7 || So what's the problem, don't use youtube then, are you paying youtube to use their servers and infrastructure? No? They are paying YOU for delivering a service and a platform to share with the world? What?  I've had it with these artists who think they're some kind of a God. Rent your own servers, create/buy your own streaming software and do it yourself. Bunch of ignorance nitwits, just play some music and shut up, please. You're freaking entertainment, please you guys all need a reality check. In the old days, they really valued you correctly, you used to be on streets playing for some money and some foods, going from town to town, and if we didn't liked you, we could just trow stones at you.  |-|

|-| cobse8e || 19 || I saw Cage the Elephant at coral skies festival and they were fucking amazing! |-| 
|-| cobtasg || 13 || Anybody else feel a strong Dr. Dog vibe on this track.  Think it's a combo of the vocals and the piano and maybe the Beatles vibe that both bands have |-| 
|-| cobt9z6 || 10 || 102.1 The EDGE if you're in Toronto, can not get enough of this song. Atleast Fred and Mel can't... |-| 
|-| cobtxqx || 10 || This song is about his wife, who is featured in the music video.

The story behind it is The lead singer of Brand New, Jesse Lacey was best friends with the guitarist and part vocalist of TBS, John Nolan. John slept with Jesses girlfriend which led to the first song being created and then John responded with "Theres No "I" in Team".

He completely re-taught himself the instrument, as an adult in crippling pain. There's been a FEW decent musicians who overcame disabilities or injuries. Deaf much, Beethoven?

I hate to call them a one-hit wonder, because they were a really fun and talented band.  Fizzy Fuzzy Big and Buzzy was one of those albums that everyone just kind of had, even if they didn't know where they had gotten it.

Some of the band members went on to become Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers, who are definitely worth checking out if you've never heard of them.  IMO, Roger Clyne is one of the best damn songwriters to come out of that decade.  He has a very clever way with words, and paints a romantic scene of a certain desert-tramp lifestyle that rivals Springsteen's depiction of life on the streets of Philly. |-|

|-| cog5m20 || 2769 || The Grammys should just keep nominating Beyonce for an award every year and giving it to someone else just to get a reaction out of Kanye. Without his little outbursts no one would be talking about the Grammys after a few days. At this point as long as Kanye keeps throwing fits they'll probably never let Beyonce win  |-| 
|-| cogiqeo || 146 || They sat him in the front row, this was expected to happen.  |-| 
|-| cogayeo || 489 || Kanye should just start his own award ceremony.
Then he can give Beyonce all the awards she deserves. |-| 
|-| cog8gb8 || 620 || While BeyoncÃ© is talented, Beck has already demonstrated that he can work with a variety of [Artists](http://www.wowhd.co.uk/blog/files/2009/12/Bendin_in_the_Wind.jpg) |-| 
|-| coga0u0 || 890 || I wonder if Kanye and BeyoncÃ© were both up for album of the year and Kanye won... Would he give the Grammy to BeyoncÃ©? |-| 
|-| cogihpp || 232 || Nobody takes the Grammys seriously, I don't understand why Kanye does. This is the same organization that gave a Frank Sinatra "best of" album the award for album of the year over the Beatle's Revolver and Dylan's Blonde on Blonde; that gave the nod to Lionel Richie's Can't Slow Down over Prince's Purple Rain and awarded Celine Dion's adult contemporary crapfest over Beck's Odelay, the Fugee's The Score and the Smashing Pumpkin's Mellon Collie. I mean fuck, they gave the Best Metal Performance Grammy to Tenacious D, a fucking *comedy* group. NARAS gives Grammys to artists who are either a decade past their prime as a sort of life time achievement award, or were never artistically relevant to begin with, and everyone seems to know it except for Kanye.

TL;DR-- Milli Vanilli won a Grammy, is Kanye retarded? |-|

|-| cog5pfx || 1433 || &gt; When asked if he had even heard of Beck "before yesterday," West added, "Come on, man. I love Beck! But he didn't have the Album of the Year."

This really annoys me, on a couple of different levels. First of all, why is this reporter implying that Beck might not be famous enough to be on Kanye's radar, and second of all, why is this reporter implying that Kanye might not be knowledgeable enough to be aware of Beck? Kanye might be arrogant, but he's not ignorant, and Beck might have put out a few sad guy albums, but he's still the guy who made 'Loser', 'Where It's At', and 'E-Pro'. |-| 
|-| cog5rz3 || 936 || I think it's hilarious when people don't get that a lot of this stuff is crafted. Kanye knew he was gonna say something like this tonight. Kanye is the biggest self promoter going right now. It doesn't matter how retarded it sounds because it has his name in the news. No ones going to stop listening to Kanye because of this, and if anything, more are gonna go pick up a Kanye record. Y'all don't think he doesn't know this? Beck doesn't give a shit either because now he too is getting mega free publicity that will only increase his bank account. It's a win win for both and the faux-outrage from the universe just leads to their benefit. |-|

Edit: I appreciate your replies! To be honest, I've always considered myself a BeyoncÃ©/Destiny's Child fan but I haven't really listened to much of her music beyond the singles. I'm going to give this album a serious listen.  |-| 
|-| cog5ptq || 270 || What if everyone did what Kanye did? Imagine if everyone else were so entitled that they insist on pushing their agenda when they disagree with award winners. Imagine this:

The winner for Bluegrass Album of the year is announced. Jerry Douglas and The Earls of Leicester. They head to the stage to accept the award, but before they can get there, 76-year old Del McCoury storms the podium and grabs the mic. Enraged, Del says "Jerry Douglas needs to respect artistry and give his award to Noam Pikelny. Noam Pikelny is the superior picker, and by not recognizing his monumental feat of music, the Grammys are disrespecting inspiration."

What a shit show it would be if everyone were as disrespectful and egocentric as Kanye. |-| 
|-| cog944v || 89 || Oh man i am really back and forth on this. 

We got to meet Beck once back stage at his summerfest set. We were huge fans and had done covers of his stuff for many year. We scraped and scraped for those VIP tickets and a chance to meet our idol. 

He blew right by us and ignored his stage manager entirely when he tried to introduce us. It was really hurtful that he wouldnt even acknowledge our existence. That and multiple account from other bands labeling him a dick (i.e.-flaming lips and ManMan) Make me wonder if he isnt just putting on a good face for the media because its awesome publicity to play the victim!

Mind you none of this detracts from the quality of his music He deserved everything he has worked for... this is just one guys (or a few) opinion of the man.  |-| 
|-| cog8kea || 141 || Kanye has 21 Grammys and is almost sure to get more From his upcoming album. Its unfair for anyone to say he sucks or is talentless. However Kanye is outspoken, and always has been. Even if you dont assume this was a publicity stunt this shouldnt be a surprise to anyone.  |-| 
|-| cogcrfn || 11 || They should give Kim a grammy and see if Kanye rushes the stage demanding Beyonce deserves it. |-|

|-| cogoa14 || 5 || Alchohol was involved with the Taylor Swift moment. But, his antics need to stop or he will lose it all. He will lose everyone that he loves and respects. Because Beyonce doesnt need you to speak for her. That makes her look bad. And now she has to throw you under the bus to make sure ppl don't think he influences this. I'm a fan of his, and he is very talented. But he went from having a chip on his shoulder to wanting it all. He has become an entitled, spoiled brat. Kanye West is a true case of letting the limelight and superstardom get to your head. Where you walk around thinking you are better than everyone else. And arent afraid to let the public know about it. He just doesnt know right from wrong. and the sad part about all of this is that he wants to be given this legendary status but that is going to be debatable for the rest of his life. Due to his asshole nature. And you only further these stereotypes that you claim to be against when it comes to Black people. You are what you hate. Losing his mother didn't really change him, it just motivated him to leave a legacy behind. And he's going about it all wrong |-| 
|-| cogg2sh || 4 || much respect to beck |-|

he's like a court jester, or something. |-| 
|-| cogoif5 || 3 || Kanye later clarified his remarks at he Grammys. When asked if he knew who Beck was, Kanye replied with, "Look, I love beck! But he didn't have the album of the year." Link to video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=84RCjYKCZuM |-| 
|-| cogoihw || 3 || Beyonce took home 3 Grammy's that night. Sam Smith took home 4. Pharrell took home 3. Beck earned that award. Awards don't determine your greatness. |-|

|-| cogjlkl || 8 || The real crime in this is that BeyoncÃ© doesn't immediatly come out and publicly call out Kanye for his absurd bullshit. |-| 
|-| coggf4t || 7 || "when you keep on diminishing art and not respecting the craft and smacking people in the face after they deliver monumental feats of music, you're disrespectful to inspiration." 

This could almost be a quote from Beck, directed at Kanye, but instead it's a quote from Kanye.  |-| 
|-| cogcsvl || 8 || West sounds like a black guy impersonating a white guy impersonating a black guy.  |-| 
|-| cogrn5z || 3 || Um... Does Kanye understand that Beck is untouchable?   I already thought that Kanye was crazy, but now I think he's just a full blown idiot.  Beck is a god and Kanye is delusional.  |-|

|-| cog9seo || 22 || *Morning Phase* was nice, but if it was album of the year, then 2014 was not a great year for music. Beck didn't rank in my Top 10 and neither did Beyonce. I thought Flying Lotus would get a nomination, and really thought it was album of the year material every time I listened to it. This is why I don't watch the Grammy's. Fucking aurally challenged, music-history-ignorant idiots decide who deserves the most praise each year? Hah |-| 
|-| cogheis || 6 || Anyone else feels sort of ticked off that Beck basically excuses West his behaviour? I mean, there's nothing wrong with trying to be the bigger man, but don't be a pushover either. Only one artist can win an award, that doesn't mean that nobody else could potentially deserve it aswell. If you don't agree with the winner, you should start your own award show. Somebody needs to explain to this man that different people have different tastes. |-|

|-| cogqm47 || 5 || Artists need to stop calling Kanye a genius. All that stuff went to his head 10 years ago. It has made him go from a rapper I could listen to, to a rapper I refuse to listen to. Does he mind people don't respect him? |-| 
|-| cogaroq || 6 || Lol circlejerk the Kanye hate.

I don't think Kanye was being super serious, even if he was, Beck wasn't offended and was happy to even be near Kanye, so who really cares? I don't, dude can do what he wants as long as he isn't hurting anyone.

Good on Beck for taking what Kanye said with stride. |-| 
|-| cogc84p || 7 || Every album Kanye has put out in the last 5 years has been a great record |-| 
|-| cogb2al || 3 || I think Beck said "in the last five years" because he's getting old and sometimes thinks that 2005 was five years ago.

Good for Beck for taking the whole thing in stride.  |-| 
|-| cognrrj || 4 || Beck was about to enjoy the best moment of his life ... For Kanye West to take that away from him is unbelievably inconsiderate, totally egotistical, a total outrage, and he should have been physically taken from the premises for his insane action... What a fucking dick... West is the lowest class and a discredit to his profession, his family, and his race... This is exactly the reason some people wonder why the fuck does a guy show what an ass he is and then he wants respect... He is an embarrassment to the human race...  |-| 
|-| cogd7po || 3 || It's the Grammys and it's Kanye West so it's an overwhelming "meh!" However, I have a hard time calling Beyonce an "artist." Extremely talented, smart and gorgeous entertainer, absolutely, but "artist?" Not so much. Beck, on the other hand and even West in my opinion, are both "artists." The Grammys are irrelevent and I'm fascinated that West even cares about them, but to say that Beyonce's same old same old, dance, R&amp;B schtick is art, but Beck's album is not? That makes no sense to me. |-| 
|-| cogomc3 || 3 || Kanye deserves to be on the stage when he wins a fucking Grammy.

Until then, they need to put that talentless egomaniac in a cage.  Don't they have security at these events? |-|

Saw Annie Lennox's performance on the Grammys and was reminded of this one. Especially fond of how uncomfortable Bowie looks at the end. |-|

This was right around the time Siamese Dream was getting released. It's so raw and guttural, the whole concert is worth watching. It's also really humbling when you hear Billy say "Stop" sort of bashfully when the crowd starts cheering during the first verse.  |-|

|-| cogj9hu || 4 || So glad shes getting recognized, unbelievably talented and I can't wait to see her continue to surprise us with her records.  |-| 
|-| cogrbwh || 16 || &gt;You are making yourself look like a complete twat.

She got to the point quite well. |-| 
|-| coh1wmt || 5 || Hit the nail on the head.  I don't think this is self-promotion at all, I think she speaks for everyone with that note and she's pretty much covered all bases.  Kanye's a talented guy but he's being an arrogant dick and embarrassed himself for the second time. |-| 
|-| cogun76 || 4 || Eh. All these celebrities chiming in isn't anything special. Especially when they have no clear connection to who they're addressing. This felt more like she was defending Beck, which really just seems as silly as Kanye defending Beyonce. It comes across like an attempt at self-promotion. I think everyone should just shut the hell up for a while. Except Beck, who is the only one not being a whiny bitch about it all. |-| 
|-| cog8mvv || 24 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| cog8zov || 17 || Beck is just a classy guy  |-| 
|-| cogi7pn || 5 || I love both of these guys. Hopefully we'll see a photo of the both of them in the studio together within a few months. Ye probably likes Beck, he did reference him on that one song on The College Dropout. |-| 
|-| cog9zrg || 13 || Beck is way more mature than to dismiss a person's accomplishments because of a stupid comment. Beck knows that he earned that award because of his hard work and many years of dedicated effort. He doesn't need Kanye's approval so he has no reason to feel slighted by his comments.   |-| 
|-| cogk68s || 4 || Kanye is a damn idiot sometimes with the things he says, but I'm glad Beck said this. Kanye is a terrific artist, and one of the biggest around now adays. People in other threads are acting like Kanye is just an idiot with nothing to offer the world. He says some dumb things but Kanye is an incredible artist. Good on Beck for being a bigger person, but the people dissing Kanye's credentials as a musician are totally missing the point.  |-|

|-| cogdhr8 || -7 || Oh is this the "kanye stans somehow try to feel validated by a winner just being classy" thread? |-| 
|-| coglgra || -5 || I'm still surprised that people consider either any good by anyone.  |-| 
|-| cogtd89 || 8 || Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, bob marley |-| 
|-| cogszuc || 7 || Metallica, guns n roses, poison, and believe it  or not I liked vanilla ice. |-| 
|-| cogtmn2 || 7 || Linkin Park 

Incubus 

The Strokes 

I think that was kind of a weird combination.  |-| 
|-| cogssal || 6 || The Offspring, Nirvana, Eve 6. I still listen to all on the regular. |-| 
|-| cogstgn || 3 || Let's see my favorites were sum 41, sublime, and blink 182. I'm pretty sure I pods weren't a thing, but I did have a pretty nifty walk man (we were poor lol). I don't really listen to those bands often anymore I do tend to listen to rock or top 40. Although it's fun to listen too sometimes!  |-| 
|-| cogte81 || 4 || Foo Fighters, Matchbox 20, Rise Against

All are good but only the Foo remain in my top 3 |-| 
|-| cogu9dz || 4 || Oh god. Avenged Sevenfold, AFI, and probably Hawthorne Heights. The emo was strong when I was 14. |-| 
|-| cogubhz || 4 || NOFX, Wu-Tang and Smashing Pumpkins.  |-| 
|-| cogxh9y || 4 || Panic! at the Disco, Linkin Park, Fall out Boy |-| 
|-| cogyi4x || 4 || The Cars, The Police, "Weird Al" Yankovic

...eye-what? Back in my day I had to use a pencil if I wanted to listen to the same song twice! You kids and your fancy eye-pads... |-| 
|-| coguu9r || 3 || Dream Theatre, Tool, and Lagwagon. 
I love me some Lagwagon. |-| 
|-| cogvvl1 || 3 || Blink 183, Everclear, Modest Mouse. I was really figuring my tastes out still

Tastes have sort of changed. I don't care for Blink much, but still like them for trips down memory lane. Still really like Everclear. Modest Mouse is my favorite band  |-|
