There is one guy who puts LOTS of effort in his hairstyle -- blonde, bleached hair, mohawks, everything. The DVD release of this film from ca. 15 years later (ca. 2003?) shows most of the teens and how they were doing "today". That guy in particular: lost all his hair...

Look in a high school yearbook from the time and you'll see mostly meek nods to the style (gelled-on-top mullets and hairsprayed-to-an-iron-hardness bangs) rather than this sort of full-blown implementation. |-|

They're actually frequency response plots for the speakers (presumably for two different bass settings, with the two different traces in the lower frequency range). This shows the magnitude of the speaker outputs at different frequencies, sort of a power spectral density, like [this] (http://media.bestofmicro.com/Z/M/408226/original/Freq-Response.png). The ones on the boom box are somewhat idealized (unrealistically flat in the mid range) but the roll-off at the lows and highs seems realistic. |-|

|-| cnxi907 || 10 || I was in my teens in Ft. Laud. at the time. It was WILD -- I remember girls like you - I wasn't allowed to talk to you. I was going to St. Thomas Aquinas and closely monitored by priests, nuns, my mom, my dad and my grandmother. 

**WILD times, great to be young and free. So many stories.**  My dad was a civil engineer and his boss invited him to his home. Well, it was such a big deal - he had just come from Cuba and he thought this important recognition for his hard work. My mom spent a week sewing a Jackie O inspired dress. When they got there, it was a wife-swapping party. They left, immediately.  |-|

|-| cnxiycw || 24 || C. Thomas Howell was the fucking man back in the day. Tank, Red Dawn, the Outsiders, ET. Apparently he has made nothing but shit since then but he had a good run. 

Red Dawn is another on of those loaded up movies. Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Charlie Sheen, Law Thompson, Jennifer Grey, Harry Dean Stanton, Powers Booth, etc.  |-|

They cut her out of the theatrical release but decades  later when released on DVD with extra footage, we were finally able to spot her. Coppola filmed this in my hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma as well as another underrated greaser film shot in black and white with only small elements in color called [Rumblefish](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086216/) (I highly recommend.)

The theater ushers got us out of there, but a little while later we snuck back in. My 14 year old self loved Matt Dillon &amp; Patrick Swayze. I thought they were the cutest!  |-|

|-| cny4e06 || 4 || Jesus, reading those Imgur comments is so fucking depressing.

Yes, you young, undereducated, spoiled narcissists: There was a time whenever people worse skimpy outfits and weren't accused of "asking for it" and rape wasn't just a casual occurrence that everyone joked about.

And if someone picked you up as a hitchhiker, you were almost positively going to get to your destination without any problems whatsoever.

All those comments just go to show how jaded and clueless and out of touch younger people are. 

Imagine a country where everyone wasn't on the search constantly for "terrorists"? Imagine a country where you looked around and didn't see axe murderers and rapists on every corner? Not every male was out to molest children, not every hitch hiker was destined to be murdered.

That's what America used to be. Hard to believe that this watered down, hijacked, joke of inequality is  but a shadow of its former self, not just in its people but also in how things are viewed. 

Millions of Americans glued to Fox News every night convinced that the terrorists are coming for them, stocking up on military grade weapons because the *government* is coming for them, not letting their kids play outside because someone is going to kidnap them, not letting their kids wear normal clothes because someone is going to try to rape them on the way to school.

What a fucking joke Americans have become and what a really horrible punch line. |-|

That hairstyle was actually at its peak of popularity in the mid-to-late 1910s, mainly because of silent film actresses like Mary Pickford (who had a similar hairstyle) but continued to be the most common long hairstyle through the 1920s.

If you see a picture of any woman with long hair in the 1920s, it's almost always that style. They created it (on purpose) by wrapping their hair around cloths. Long straight hair in general just wasn't really fashionable until the 1960s. Source: I have a mild obsession with fashion from the 1910s-1930s. |-|

|-| co0l1nr || 6 || FYI - colorized image: I colorized this - http://www.reddit.com/tb/1ic71u - a year ago.  |-| 
|-| co0n62m || 5 || That girl looks exactly like me. I would never be Miss Anything, what a shame. |-|

|-| co0g3rq || 14 || I think her curls are ugly but otherwise I like her hair. I don't like how hair is now always supposed to be straight and super neat. Messy hair can look good too. |-| 
|-| co0lt4v || 3 || I've seen her before.  The weird thing is, I look identical to this woman. |-|

|-| co0p7oh || 3 || Well, then you'll love the [Bathing Beauty Pageant, 1925, Huntington Beach, CA](http://www.loc.gov/resource/ds.06665/) - Not entirely shabby although Miss America certainly had some competition. |-| 
|-| co0pgv3 || 3 || Serious bed head |-| 
|-| co0pwqe || 3 || She looks a lot better than most modern Miss America contestants to me, honestly. |-| 
|-| co0r48t || 3 || What a peach! |-| 
|-| co0skrp || 3 || Dude I have almost her exact same nose. |-| 
|-| co0tqcz || 3 || Not a very flattering picture however you can tell from the bone structure and proportions that in person this young lady was a pre raphaelite goddess |-| 
|-| co0vmk3 || 3 || Mess america |-| 
|-| co0wd3h || 3 || Do you think she would be considered pretty today? Just a curious question. |-| 
|-| co0wl3a || 3 || Wow she is gorgeous! |-| 
|-| co0z5xm || 3 || Beautiful hair |-| 
|-| co122x7 || 3 || I hoped I might get some information on this photo from the comments, like what made this woman special enough to make her Miss America, if it really was because standards on women's attractiveness were so different, etc. But it might have been a little misguided of me to expect anything. From what I read (though it wasn't much) things having to do with the Miss America Pageant were somewhat impacted after the second-wave feminism movement nearing the '70s, but otherwise it seemed to always be "a representation of a popular, intelligent American beauty".
If anyone was curious, she actually looked cute with her hair done up but she often wore hats. She beat out 83 some-odd contestants which is a record number for competitors in pageant history. So I imagine she was a little more special than the 2 everyone's giving her for the bird's nest on her head in this picture. For anyone curious:

|-| co0k8ad || 3 || It's so weird that you can tell she's from an older time just by how her face looks. Do we (white people probably descended from British colonials) look different now because of our intermingling with other peoples and different diets? I know people with a similar "look" as her (her facial structure, it's hard to explain) and they tend to be much more recently from Europe.  |-| 
|-| co0l03s || 3 || I still think she's cute. Not *beautiful* by today's standards but definitely a cutie... God, she's probably dead 30 years or so....

Hair's a mess. Was that hair in style back then or was it real windy on the boardwalk?

Page 1

Somewhere in Germany
Month of May
Our Day the 4th 1945

Dearest Beloved, 

Writing this letter is the hardest task I’ve done for a long time, know not where or how to start, or even how to give you an explanation in the lapse in my letter’s for three months.

I can’t explain the feeling I’ve had for the past three months. It’s a feeling I’ve had of emptyness inside. Not caring today is Sunday or my name is Ted. 
	
More or less, “today” is mine, ‘tomorrow” I know not what may come. 
	
Page 2

This feeling has left me know because things are turned for the best. At least I’m more comfortable now &amp; have something to look forward to. Going home &amp; you. 

Honey to go home to you would be all a fella could ask for. But, to go home &amp; have to come back to this again. I don’t think I could take that. I’ve had enough of this army life &amp; war almost five years. 

The news &amp; the way things are going this war shouldn’t last much longer. 
It looks I shall make the states one of these fine days within the next six months. 

Page 3

Well honey lets get off the gloomy side of things. On factor has arisen, has your Love changed for me? I’m hopeing not, but you have a good cause to change. In my inconsistency in my letters. 

But one thing my Love for you is as ever. No one can break my love for you, except yourself &amp; then I still would continue to Love you .

But things are too well suited to every come between us. In our ways, in our thoughts, in our every day doings. You are included in my every thought. 

I love you Midgie &amp; always shall, Forever. 

Page 4

How is my Midgie doing at her new job? Swelligent! As for myself I’m fine and dandy. Your letters are a symbol of faithfulness &amp; true love. 

I admit I am not much good for anything. But that’s beside the point. It’s you I have to make Happy &amp; repay you in comfort &amp; happiness for all these years of waiting &amp; working while your girlfriends enjoyed married life. 

No man could ask for a better companion for a lifetime partnership. Than “My Midgie” My life is just a foundation built on you. My every doing are with you in every thought &amp; actions. 

Page 5

Bording this last page is as my photo above. I’m sitting wondering if things back home are going to be the same? As for our’s Love shall never change. But our homes? Our Friends? I guess I’ll have to change my opinions about a lot of people in a hurry to get along. But don’t worry Honey, I haven’t changed only in age &amp; human knowledge. 
	
I love you as no man has every Loved his treasured possessions &amp; you’re my Treasured possession. Bright eyes, dimple chin, faithful &amp; loyal &amp; ever so loveable. Till I push my quill again I’ll say Good night &amp; Keep smiling &amp; I Love You Midgie. 

Love &amp; Kisses
Your Teddy

P.S. Be Sweet
