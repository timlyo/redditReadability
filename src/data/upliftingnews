Yes, we're all so educated on foreign policy, the nature of dependency and the ridiculousness of sending unskilled workers to foreign areas where they can really provide no benefit (and in some cases, contribute to the white saviour complex), but I'll be damned if reddit can't just let a 16-year-old girl who tried to do something nice have a little bit of credit.

Funny twist, he really didn't even have to 'sell' us on the Kirby as we had already made our mind up about buying one the next time a salesmen came by for a demo. It was his lucky day for sure. |-|

|-| cnvdqlq || 137 || As the parent of a child with autism who has weird interests I love this story!! My son was into vacuums for a while and at age 4 would watch vacuum demo videos on youtube for ever if I let him.

His big thing has always been Buses and Metro trains (really all forms of transportation). There are adults who post videos of Metro Trains and buses on Youtube and they are my heroes! We spend lots of time watching them and pretending we are driving buses and trains.   If there is anyone from WMATA (Washington Dc metro) on Reddit....

|-| cnvhchs || 18 || I was a door to door salesman for about 6 months. I sold home security systems. It was the absolute worst job I have ever had in my life.

The fact is, 99% of the time people just don't want to be bothered at home. They sure as hell don't want any kind of solicitor knocking on their door trying to sell them something they don't need.

I hated that job. I was yelled at, cussed at, and even threatened. I would go home depressed, just exhausted because I felt so low after repeatedly being called names all day. It came to the point where I didn't even want to be around my wife and kids cause I was so stressed out. But, at the time it was the only job I could find...so I tried to make it work. 

To this day, whenever someone knocks on my door trying to sell something, I give them the time of the day. I might not buy what they're selling, but I know they're just doing their job and it's a tough job, so I owe it to them and myself, to at least listen to what they have to say.  |-| 
|-| cnviiu9 || 3 || No matter what you do, you can make a difference in someone else's life if you look for the opportunity. In a world where only the largest achievements are celebrated, its the little things like this that truly show how important each of us is to the world and how much of a difference we can make. That has been one of the hardest things for me to accept as I have grown up; its not the value of your most important achievement, but all of your smaller achievements that truly make you a great person in the current time. |-| 
|-| cnvizi5 || 45 || If this sales rep, Al Archie, actually paid for this vacuum for the kid out of pocket, reddit should rally the troops and hook him up. Even at his cost, I'm sure it wasn't cheap. Thoughts? |-|

|-| cnvktem || 4 || I find this story very interesting because I used to work at a children's home and one of the kids that lived there was a 17-year-old Autistic boy named Derek, who was also fascinated with vacuum cleaners.  He had an art project once and even his macaroni picture was a vacuum cleaner. What is really struck me when reading this account is that Derek thought Kirby's were the best as well. I wish I knew a way to contact Derek because I'm sure he and Dylan (the boy in this story) would be best friends. 

Derek's mother told us that she thought Derek came to like vacuum cleaners because he fount their sound soothing as a child. Perhaps it drowned out all the extraneous sensory input that Autistic children have difficulty processing. 

In any event Derek had an interesting way of expressing himself. If another boy was mean to Derek, he would stand inches from their face and yell "Like me! Like me! Like me!"  When describing a girl he liked at school, he said she had a "chaseable face." I will never forgot Derek and many of the other children I worked with in my 20 years on various psychiatric units.  |-|

|-| cnxvvbw || 3 || &gt;the original rug cost $500.00

The real question that needs to be asked is: Why are government agencies spending $500 on custom rugs with logos? Why not use an inexpensive solid color rug? I'm not saying that their buildings and vehicles don't need signage, of course they do, but rugs?  Just because you get a budget, shouldn't  mean that you have to spend it all or lose it. Bonuses should be given to accountants and purchasers that save money. Every five years, accrued surpluses should be returned to the citizens, or the tax rates should be lowered. Saving the taxpayers money should be a concern of every governmental agency. This wastefulness is a little sickening, but I'm glad that money was raised for charity and it wasn't a total loss. |-| 
|-| cobcwm0 || 572 || CPR classes should start being taught in school and it shouldn't cost you anything to get your cpr certification, at least, renewed. This is knowledge and a skill every person should have!

|-| cobif1z || 141 || What's up with these titles. The Chief deserves credit too for saving this child's life.

|-| cobckor || 157 || Holy shit,  I never considered the amount of stress 911 dispatchers have to face specially with a diying child or suicides.  Imagine having to go home with the voices of the kids parents in your head had he not made it. Being able to keep calm while someone is dying has to take alot out of you.   |-| 
|-| cobd4du || 81 || I don't get it, why would they not be allowed to give CPR instructions? I can't see any reason as to why it would be forbidden. |-| 
|-| cobiqmq || 10 || I'm so happy to hear a dispatcher not only be empathetic but also be professional and a team coordinator as this all was occurring in real time. You can hear him typing and giving orders verbally in order to make coordination of care exist seamlessly. I wouldn't be surprised if he had NICU on even another line with details of the patient before the ambulance even arrives to the scene. 
Much respect. Saving lives by integrating and directing a primary and thorough history taking - before the patient even arrives to the primary care facility. 
With the horror stories of "911" misuse or misunderstandings, I can only guess that this situation is what This operator lives for, he he is doing an excellent effing job.  |-| 
|-| coblp5l || 9 || I once had to go through this when I was 17. I was instructed to step by step CPR on my elderly neighbor. He had just asked my dad to go and get us some burgers and fries and talk to him for a bit. His wife passed 7 years before then and had just lost his pug. So we were eating, I went back to my house and my dad stayed and talked to him. (He was like another grandfather to him) He then took a bite of a fry and then had a blank stare and laid on his side on the couch. My dad called me (my dad speaks very little english and understands it okay) and told me to called 911. I was instructed to put him on the floor and follow the CPR procedures. I was terrified, and the first compression I made caused his mouth to release his last breath of air... I will never forget it. 244 compressions. Shortly after the paramedics arrived. MI. He passed away February 21, 2009. He was like a grandfather to us. RIP Jerry.

tl;dr: elderly caucasian neighbor stopped breathing, gave cpr through phone, MI, scary experience |-| 
|-| cobj5i1 || 8 || CPR training saves lives |-| 
|-| cobn4i3 || 8 || I have been a firefighter/EMT for several years. Every save I have had on cardiac arrest patients was because a bystander started CPR before we arived. If we get on scene and CPR still has not been started there is a very slim chance of the person being revived. Citizens absolutely need to know CPR and first aid. From the time you call 911 till the time we enter the room will probably be almost 10 minutes. The survivability Rate after 5min is extremely low. Something like 4 or 5 percent. |-|

|-| cobn5ec || 6 || Hands only CPR as taught by the AHA. This is THE American Heart Association page instructing people on how to perform hands only CPR. There seems to be some confusion as to whether or not people should attempt CPR without having a class. 


I am a CPR instructor and healthcare professional and guarantee that just about anybody can do CPR with less than a minute of instruction. 

http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/CPRAndECC/HandsOnlyCPR/Hands-Only-CPR_UCM_440559_SubHomePage.jsp |-| 
|-| cobl6f9 || 14 || So let me see if I got this straight: because the Galax Police Department chose not to invest in their personnel by paying for "emergency medical dispatcher certification" CPR training for an emergency medical dispatcher, said dispatcher had to jeopardize their livelihood and career in order to save another human being's life. This is uplifting? |-| 
|-| cobnk88 || 5 || It's great that this happens, but (IIRC) no one should get their hopes up too high. Yeah, CPR saves lives...but it's a "hail mary" at best.

Since this is /r/UpliftingNews, I will finish off with the positive side: If you are in a position to give CPR, you have little to fear. Your victim is all but gone, with a slim chance of survival and virtually no chance of complete recovery. You can't mess this up. Go for it. 30 HARD compressions (or whatever number you remember) at 100/minute (hum a standard disco song, like "Stayin' Alive")... whatever whatever. Who knows? Maybe you'll do it! Maybe an AED or ambulance will show up in time and you'll be the big damn hero. |-| 
|-| cobhsbg || 10 || What a hero! Those were some gut-wrenching moments while the dispatcher is trying to get a word in. I would've started with, "Ma'am, I want to help you help your son, but in order to do that I need you to listen to me NOW!".  |-| 
|-| cobe4ml || 23 || I can't believe how calm that dispatcher was, despite the mother and grandmother's best efforts to get him to join their panic powwow.
"HURRY!! HURRY!! HURRY!! HE CAN'T BREATH!!"  Address not given for like two and a half minutes. |-| 
|-| cobkbsf || 17 || &gt;Caller: “This is my only son, I can’t lose him!”

&gt;Dispatcher: “I’m not gonna let you lose him. Put him on your kitchen table ok?”

&gt;Caller: “Ok.”

&gt;Dispatcher “All right, barely pinch his nose off and put your mouth over top of his mouth, and I need you to blow in it just a second and see ok?”


Instructions unclear. My baby is alive but now has no nose. |-| 
|-| cobhrri || 33 || Jesus christ that woman is incredibly annoying. The amount of attention she gave the emergency dispatcher really could've been the difference between life and death.

In situations like this the most important thing is to listen to people who know what they are doing and not just screaming over them. |-| 
|-| cobgmxb || 4 || This is different to the Australian system.

Up until recently, EMD's (Emergency Medical Dispatchers) were taugh basic first aid skills. This has since been discontinued I believe.


However, we have a set list of scripted questions and instructions to follow. One of which is cpr instructions (both for resuscitation and compressions)


It's useful, because even without the hands on skill (or even just forgetting the general rules of cpr) there will always be a set of instructions on hand to deal with this sort of thing.

 |-| 
|-| cobi1fk || 3 || Very happy the child survived. I have to admit that I was disappointed the audio cut out before the ambulance showed up. Really wanted to hear those sirens rolling in.  |-| 
|-| cobmgyd || 3 || I'm CPR certified, but I have to say, who hasn't seen CPR performed dozens or hundreds of times on TV or in movies? Even if you don't know the EXACT procedure, doesn't everyone know enough to at least give it a shot if you have to? As opposed to just screaming and panicking and calling someone, with just seconds to spare? What if the guy didn't give instructions? oh, I work for a huge company,once a year free CPR class to anyone who wants to take it |-|

When she died she left £15,000 to myself, two brothers, uncle, aunt and my parents. So around £90k total. I never knew she was putting money by and I never got the chance to thank her.

You probably should do a little re-touch to that first photo... there's an unfortunately placed finger... |-|

You can build a $500 dialysis machine. You cannot sell that machine without FDA approval, and now it's a $30,000 machine because the costs you need to recoup before selling a single unit are suddenly in the tens of millions. Also, you'll eventually get sued for huge amounts of money no matter how safe the device is, so you're going to need to carry some expensive insurance. |-| 
|-| cogimq9 || 6 || i really appreciate the fact that anya has put in a lot of effort and application into this project and clearly she has incredible potential in whatever field she decides to get into.

However, to compare what she has made to all the functions of what a current dialysis machine does is a little silly.  some of the other posts here hint at this, but the concept of dialysis is fairly simply at its base.  the application of it to be used multiple times a day, on different patients, with impeccable safety, year in, year out; that's where the expense comes from.

the cost of a dialysis machine isn't in the physical membranes and solutions, its in the safety engineering of the machine which allows it to be used in a real world clinical setting, which includes the testing allowing for FDA clearance.

having said that, all ideas start out small, and again, not to take away anything from Anya herself.  But lets please not start saying that she has solved the issue of costs within the medical system. |-|

|-| coghw18 || 3 || Haemodialysis nurse here - its a stripped down machine that we use. The practical application i'm afraid falls down when you need purified water in massive amounts to dilute the dialsate concentration or else your going to have very dead people. The units we utilise keep close check on the concentration of the additive and of course the pressure on the needles as you don't want to 'blow' (when a needle dislodges and cuts through the fistula) and pump blood at high speed causing massive blood loss/haematoma.  |-|

Farmers were using land they didn't own. The owner of the land, Clayco, kicked them off because they are starting to develop the land. But in a gesture of good will Clayco is gifting them 8 acres, a new irrigation system, and a small building with restrooms and running water. |-|
