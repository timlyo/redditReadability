|-| cntx21s || 3 || This was beautiful thank you. Showing my boyfriend when he gets home :) |-| 
|-| cntx5qx || 78 || This is from 2011, not 2014, by the way. |-| 
|-| cntxi5h || 3 || Yes, it's the same vocalist from [Vulfpeck's 1612](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRHQPG1xd9o) and [Wait For The Moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4G0nbpLySI). Antwaun Stanley is his name and slayin' is his game. |-| 
|-| cntycwc || 13 || Sounds really great. I could really see something like this in Animal Crossing. In fact, now I kinda want to see more video game music redone is smooth and soft jazz. |-| 
|-| cntyu4y || 3 || are there any other good OOT covers out there? |-| 
|-| cntyuju || 3 || Pleasantly surprised, thanks for the share mate. |-| 
|-| cntz4dr || 31 || The rest of the album is great as well. You should check out the song "Fall in Love" by BBNG. |-| 
|-| cntzmhb || 65 || BADBADNOTGOOD just did a kick ass remix of Seasons (Waiting on You) by Future Islands. It totally changes the feel of the song but, in a good way! |-| 
|-| cnu02f4 || 7 || You should listen to by BBNG

 |-| 
|-| cnu0lcd || 4 || fucking thank you! i could not remember their name! |-| 
|-| cnu0v57 || 24 || BBNG is one of my favorite bands. Their covers are great ([CMYK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFr9X6f3J9I) is fantastic and [Bugg'n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg0Ozh46mak) performed live is crazy) but really give their original music a try! They also have an upcoming collab album with Ghostface Killah in February. 

Also, if there's a chance to see them perform, absolutely go. They put on killer shows! |-| 
|-| cnu0wce || -5 || Ehh sounds like they were trying to be jazzy by noodling around with the timing, but it didn't work. |-| 
|-| cnu11e0 || 3 || I'm like 99% confident I've heard this while watching Destiny's stream before. |-| 
|-| cnu174r || 33 || Pressed play, heard the first 10 seconds, pressed pause. Went and got my over ear headphones, replayed from beginning. Sat back, closed my eyes and enjoyed.

Thanks OP. I needed that.  |-| 
|-| cnu2wck || -6 || They're extremely talented guys, I used to hang with their roommate and would overhear them jamming before they were officially 'BBNG'. Seems like they're hovering a line between sophisticated jazz and teenage raging these days with the mascot and all. Once these guys grow all the way up to mature gentlemen they'll likely be the next Steely Dan, but until they drop trying to please the college and high school crowds with epic raves of jazz shows and covers of video game songs they won't evolve to what they could be.  |-| 
|-| cnu3ac2 || 4 || Wow. Look at the shirt I'm wearing right now! [Toronto!](http://imgur.com/Xb5qSlN.jpg) |-| 
|-| cnu3zj8 || 3 || Thoroughly recommend seeing these guys live. I was right up the front in a tiny event room, ended up on stage for the last song. Possibly the best concert I've ever been to. |-| 
|-| cnu4n5b || 5 || Check out the two songs they released with Ghostface Killa. These guys do some great work. |-| 
|-| cnu6352 || 5 || I saw them live in December. I waited a bit long on the tickets so by the time I showed up to the venue it was sold out. That usually doesn't stop me from going into the show anyways. :P

So I stuck around, I noticed this dude that looked like a straight up roadie to BBNG (turns out he was) so I asked if he had any extra tickets to sell, then he took my name and said that he'll try, 5 minutes later he comes back and gives me a ticket and a +1 for my friend. It was great. Love BBNG. |-| 
|-| cnu6o6w || 3 || Got a chance to mix these guys in SF. Very cool dudes and an excellent live show. |-| 
|-| cnu6uib || 3 || They also do a MF DOOM mix which sounds fucking amazing. I love BBNG 

[BBNG - DOOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmCytJPqQis) |-| 
|-| cnu7xwr || 16 || Here is a "ragtime jazz" version of [Saria's Song] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6wdiWP9gfc) written and played by Kento Watanabe, a composer who I was in a jazz band with in college.  |-| 
|-| cnubvq2 || -11 || Reported.

This band has been posted dozens of times on this subreddit and has clearly been upvoted by people who know them already, in breach of the sidebar rules. |-| 
|-| cnucfam || 10 || BASED IS HOW YOU FEEL INSIDE. HOWEVER YOU DO IT, STAY CREATIVE. |-| 
|-| cnucxs2 || 3 || Thouroughly enjoyed that. Will further listen to BBNG. |-| 
|-| cnum6c3 || 4 || This isn't meant to bring the mood down, this track is clearly a fantastic cover... but does anyone else feel like the dynamic range of this recording is entirely and utterly clipped? 

It's as if it's loud no matter how much I turn down the volume. 

EDIT: spelin'
EDIT2: Saria's Song is slightly better than the opening track. It's like the mic was in the piano or something, |-| 
|-| cnv0myp || 26 || [His SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/kaanlifemusic), where you can listen to his awesome first mixtape, *L.M.R*, and also his AMAZING new stuff.

[Download *L.M.R* here.](http://www.datpiff.com/mixtapes-detail.php?id=610670)

Enjoy! |-| 
|-| cnv4o2q || 3 || Great song choice! I love his sax arrangements. Kudos for spreading the good word about an under-sung legend!  |-| 
|-| cnv5d4o || 15 || Holy Shit! This kid can spit. His style is like the crescendo of Alphabet Aerobics by Blackalicious, but he's spitting at that T to Z pace and beyond from start to finish. Impressive and the bits I could actually keep up with on first listen through sounded quite intelligent. Nice to hear 'Creep' sampled so effectively too. That really took me back to my adolescence. Thanks for sharing. |-| 
|-| cnv5px3 || 5 || loving the Creep sample here. 90s music is the bestest.  |-| 
|-| cnv5wft || 4 || Bars on bars on bars on bars on bars.

Damn. |-| 
|-| cnv6shp || 6 || aaaaaaaaawesome flow! Don't change when you get famous please :-) |-| 
|-| cnv74jm || 10 || straight fire, has a hint of logic in there. Loving it! |-| 
|-| cnv7la2 || -8 || This would be 20x better d he was rapping about the devil or something. This intellectual shit is just boring. |-| 
|-| cnv7p39 || 3 || thats well neat, thanks I like this. Always good finding new artists :)  |-| 
|-| cnv7swn || 6 || Holy. Fucking. Shit. This guy can spit. Best flow I've heard in months. |-| 
|-| cnv7z8m || 3 || First time actually listening to something from this sub, am not disappointed.  |-| 
|-| cnv820v || 3 || Yes man, this is fucking great!! love anything industrial sounding, thanks man :)  |-| 
|-| cnv8u0s || 3 || Everyone go listen to KAANCEPTS if you haven't already. Dude has infinity lungs |-| 
|-| cnvapg0 || 3 || fuckin dope bro! respect from cleveland |-| 
|-| cnvax59 || 3 || Straight Fire! I hope he stays satisfied with a smaller niche audience 'cause this ain't flying on the MTV. 

 |-| 
|-| cnvbldb || 3 || Holy hell... if people trusted me with awards I would throw them at him |-| 
|-| cnvdp4k || 4 || anyone know where i can find a download for this song?
 |-| 
|-| cnve1kz || 14 || Skills for sure. One of the best things about rap is storytelling, all the legends of rap have the flow and the story. I feel like this guy is just words :/ |-| 
|-| cnve4ys || 3 || This shit is fire. 10/10 will recommend  |-| 
|-| cnve7wu || 3 || I don't really like that I can't understand what he is saying. At parts its just like wubidawubidawubidawubidawubidawubidawubida to me. Even the slower parts are somewhat hard to make out. I like him but if I had been his producer I woulda tried to get him to enunciate more. That is all. |-| 
|-| cnverlc || 4 || If induced with a proper dosage of codeine/horse tranquilizers, you end up with [Sophisticated Goon Shit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjgRe0y4SWQ&amp;t=0m41s) by Greg Enemy from 2011.

 |-| 
|-| cnvg0ub || 4 || For those confused, or looking for this song. The song is called Velvet Slide, and the album is called Already Out of Time. 

That being said, you can listen to the whole album by following the link. It's also on Spotify. Great album, though I don't hear any Timberlake...maaaybe Timbaland. |-| 
|-| cnvrdnd || 3 || awesome song!

the intro sounded like the [THX sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfg9DVwOd9w) haha
 |-| 
|-| cnvsiz1 || 3 || Reynad's promotion is succesful apparently... |-| 
|-| cnvsowd || 3 || So pumped for this album. Julep is so great! |-| 
|-| cnvsrd8 || -4 || Dead Milkmen were fun...the band's not bad either. 
 |-| 
|-| cnvzmjl || 4 || I would have never guessed that the Dead milk men made videos. Thanks for sharing! |-| 
|-| cnxjhtv || 24 || Lo-Fi indeed.  That drum sounds like a wash tub being hit with an old shoe.  I do, however, *love* the name of the band. |-| 
|-| cnxkzpc || 4 || Vaporwave is  hit or miss with me... This was a definite miss. 

This just sounds like repetitive electronic pop that wants to jump on a new genrea. The only thing that makes this vaporwave is the poorly used sample... |-| 
|-| cnxl6jc || 4 || hey nice, these guys played at the same gig as my buddies band. Interesting seeing them here.  |-| 
|-| cnxm7ld || 6 || They have a song called Weird Honey, absolutely love it. |-| 
|-| cnxn7nx || 9 || They got a bunch of really short albums/EPs on [their bandcamp](http://elvisdepressedly.bandcamp.com/) where you can name your price. I highly recommend all of it. |-| 
|-| cnxnv5d || 17 || I'm really happy to see this band get some love so close to the front page, their stuff is really solid. I recommend their other album "holo pleasures" as well. |-| 
|-| cnxoi9c || 14 || IF you like this check out coma cinema
 |-| 
|-| cnxqa96 || 3 || I've never heard that chord progression before. 

But really, this song is kinda fun.  |-| 
|-| cnxqg1l || 5 || Mickeys Dead is probably one of my favorite albums to listen straight through. I highly recommend it and all their music is available as name your price on bandcamp |-| 
|-| cnxqh30 || 3 || HOly shit that sounded good. This is like the music the bands from my highschool were like. I need more. |-| 
|-| cnxu10j || 3 || this sounds really cool, thumbs up! |-| 
|-| cnxucm5 || 5 || Why is this labeled as "garage punk"? I wonder if maybe a re-assessment of the genre flair system is in order. |-| 
|-| cnxw94u || 7 || A little something special for anyone out there who didn't know they needed this in their life. |-| 
|-| cnxy425 || 3 || Isbell 's music is great, going back to his DBT days. All around great act. Saw him solo, drunk with the 400 Unit and after sobering up. Looking forward to the next one. |-| 
|-| cnxyc3b || 3 || Mickey's dead is definitely my favorite album of theirs. Real interesting sound  |-| 
|-| cnxz1ev || 3 || elvis depressedly is one of my all-time favourite bands. almost all of their albums are free off bandcamp, as someone else mentioned. |-|

|-| cny0haj || 7 || I fucking love Jason Isbell. Great post. This is what real country is, not that formulaic pop shit with a southern accent. |-| 
|-| cny0tzz || 3 || Also, [All I Really Want To Do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=780dZ5ou4jM) |-| 
|-| cny119b || 3 || G-easy goes hard on the regular... So nice |-| 
|-| co0db2f || 16 || I love it, reminds me of Squirrel Nut Zippers a bit |-| 
|-| co0g8cr || 26 || Saw Larry and his flask opening up for another band and had no idea who they were...one of the best live performances I'd ever seen.. So much fucking energy  |-| 
|-| co0ghiu || 12 || First saw Larry and His Flask open for Foxy Shazam in Detroit with some friends. We were all big Foxy Shazam fans, so going into this we didn't know anything about the opener. I unconvincingly told my friends, "It's alternative country apparently, so it could be pretty good or pretty bad."

Man, were we in for a treat. [They opened with this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZGy_IN9iEU) and I've been a big fan ever since. Grab their latest two albums; they're both really good. And definitely go see them live if you get a chance! They're still [recovering from having a lot of their gear stolen while on the very tour on which I saw them.](http://www.larryandhisflask.com/2014/06/07/help-our-van-trailer-and-all-our-gear-was-stolen-in-cayce-south-carolina-last-night/) |-| 
|-| co0ii2h || 9 || I used to skate with these guys years ago when it was just the brothers in a punk band. Haven't really listened to them in years, what I remember from the original band was that they mainly would write songs about their genitalia. These guys have come a long way and it's always interesting to see that they are making it in a tough business.

Support your local music, cause these guys didn't have much when they started, but they did have a great local scene to start up in.  |-| 
|-| co0ivql || 6 || I've been listening to Larry since I was 15 - back when Jamin was the lead singer. They started in my hometown! :) |-| 
|-| co0iky2 || 5 || Larry and his Flask Live are amazing.  |-| 
|-| co0swcp || 4 || These guys played in the hallway of a hotel I stayed at while attending "The Fest" in Florida. The hotel staff were so pissed, but it was the best impromptu 3AM show I've ever seen! I'm glad to see they're still jamming out. |-| 
|-| co0h66d || 3 || I love it! So much energy! A great variety of instruments and talent! Awesome lyrics! Thanks for sharing!  |-| 
|-| co0k0zw || 3 || I saw them at Warped Tour '11, and they opened Main Stage. Half-way through their set, the bassist brought his upright out into the crowd and played an entire song. It was a small crowd, but they brought it, and everyone had a great time. |-| 
|-| co0vcbs || 3 || https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJHDO93JT7g 
My personal favorite. My brother played it while i was playing The Last of Us for the first time. I think it works so well, made me never forget it. 
Also try Ebb and Flow! |-| 
|-| co0c5op || 12 || This is seriously the only time I have ever clicked on an r/listentothis link, and it was all because of the two words "of Hum." I was not disappointed. Great share. Thanks! |-| 
|-| co0dp09 || 7 || "Recorded by Matt Talbott of Hum" That's a listen.  |-| 
|-| co0bbby || 5 || this is great!   |-| 
|-| co0f0s5 || 5 || That was freakin' awesome. Great video, too. |-| 
|-| co0f4ga || 4 || These dudes have been in a bunch of other bands and have always worked their asses off. So happy for them.

 |-| 
|-| co0jx33 || 4 || Groovy.  Sounds like Pedro the Lion meets DFA 1979. |-| 
|-| co0hddr || 13 || For anyone who knows German: The title is supposed to be yiddish. Bei Mir Bistu Shein. So the pronunciation is in Yiddish. That's why.

Also, damn good song. Love some jazz/swing. |-| 
|-| co0gn2n || 7 || Should be noted that this is an old jazz standard. |-| 
|-| co0ghj4 || 4 || I love that bands like this and Caravan Palace have a place in today's music scene.  |-| 
|-| co0mpp9 || 4 || These guys actually came and played at North Carolina State University a few months ago and I had the opportunity to attend. They sound just as good live as they do in the video. |-| 
|-| co0dgea || 8 || Check out Tibetan Popstars. Great song. |-| 
|-| co0ed13 || 5 || Sister Cities is my favorite Hop Along tune, and I highly suggest anyone who hasn't heard it to [CLICK HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiuFlp7FJ8). 

The video is from a series called Shaking Through where they are taken in by a recording crew and told to work their way through a new song and to record it on the spot. It's really neat! 

[There's also this really cool video for the production, too!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJTPafNbsqY) |-| 
|-| co0ca3w || 3 || I love these guys. No Good Al Joad is just a fantastic song, very emotional and heavy without being overwhelming. How'd you find them? |-| 
|-| co0e7yp || 3 || These guys are great! I saw them open for Bomb the Music Industry a couple years ago  |-| 
|-| co0vhar || 4 || Love his stuff but my fav is still the Crunch!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeIAXlwVlZc |-| 
|-| co0i7yf || 4 || These guys are freakin awesome.  If you like this track go get *Friday Night in San Francisco*.  One of my all time favorite albums. |-| 
|-| cob1fyj || 167 || Any reason you aren't [using radd.it to play the content?](http://radd.it/r/listentothis) 

It will work on [month end lists too.](http://radd.it/r/rad_it/wiki/listentothis/top_50_posts_in_rlistentothis_for_january_2015)

It now embeds in reddit and is [part of RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) (there's a popout radd.it player in RES that will replace the sidebar).

It'll turn any page on reddit into a playlist, just edit the URL up top and replace **reddit.com** with **radd.it**. 

For example, if you search for top for the week this is the URL in your browser.

http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/top/?sort=top&amp;t=week

This is the same results, just converted into a playlist.

http://radd.it/r/listentothis/top/?sort=top&amp;t=week

If you have RES this link will also show as an embedded playlist.

I gotta admit I'm a bit shocked how few people know about radd.it. That was developed *right here for reddit music* by /u/radd_it like *two years ago.* It's linked in the sidebars of most music subreddits (including ours), it's the "✩ Play All ✩" button at the top of listentothis. It works on mobile and on desktop. It does music, movies, and images (including the NSFW subs).

If there are things you want it to do that it doesn't do, the development subreddit is /r/radd_it and the author is all ears. 

Next you'll be telling me you don't know about our IOS/Android apps, the spotify applets, the XBMC plugin... c'mon guys, the [listening apps page loves you.](/r/listentothis/wiki/tools) Pay it a visit! There's like a dozen ways to get all of reddit's music that don't involve being on reddit itself - why do you think there are so few comments in listentothis? Most people *aren't really here!* |-| 
|-| cob8ae7 || 16 || It would just be full of hippie alternative songs tbh.

I like my soul. I like my Motown. And I like my rap. But hardly any of it seems to make it to the front page.  |-| 
|-| cob63fx || 13 || Perhaps spotify is a better option. |-| 
|-| cob7iz2 || 5 || Take a look at ublock for [Firefox](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%C2%B5block/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en), it uses less RAM, than Adblock, and doesn't whitelist ads. |-| 
|-| cobkqqp || 4 || This actually does exist and it's great. The user called Hearddit on soundcloud does it automatically along with a few other music subs. |-| 
|-| cob6qhm || 5 || You can kind of accomplish this with IFTTT |-| 
|-| cob2slu || 4 || This video would have been so much fun to film |-|

|-| cobbe53 || 3 || Whoa, awesome! This is my band! Super rad to see it get posted here, glad you guys dig it! 

EDIT: I'll also add that this is especially funny since this video wasn't even officially released yet; we were just holding it on our YouTube page while we got our act together.  |-| 
|-| cob0xff || 15 || Artists like Shakey Graves and Kishi Bashi will still appear here, just less often than before. This should cool down some of our artist circlejerking. This is also the best we can do until the next great bot is written.  |-| 
|-| cob43ni || 11 || But have you heard of CHVRCHES and Shakey Graves? |-| 
|-| cobbxka || 4 || So basically for every 100 upvotes, another 30 days is added to the cooldown? |-|
