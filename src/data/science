There are a lot of different factors that go into answering a survey question. In this specific situation, the question itself makes no sense and people may be trying to fill in the blanks and assume it is talking about genetic modified DNA. There is also the consideration that some people may not inherently know what "DNA" means, while it is obvious to us, many people may not remember highschool biology and with out any context, it could be anything from a pathogen to a petro-chemical (e.g., H1N1, BPA, etc.), because the interview is asking if they want to regulate it, they may make the assumption it is dangerous. Finally, if you don't give people a "Don't know/Not applicable" option, they will choose an answer randomly if it does not apply to them or they can't answer.

This isn't a failure on the American public but the design of the question.   |-|

I think the elderly part is the most important, here. People in their 70s will develop heart disease no matter what. It's part of aging. But this study by no means says that eating more sodium won't lead to heart disease. What about the 40 year olds? Having consistently elevated blood pressure is not good.  It can lead to heart disease, congestive heart failure, and development of other disorders. And in this younger population, when people aren't developing these diseases just because of age, I bet there would be a correlation, as opposed to this study.

Take these results... with a grain of salt.  And don't take this as a green light to not watch your sodium intake as a young person. |-|

&gt;In the community, alcohol consumption of up to 7 drinks/week at early-middle age is associated with lower risk for future HF, with a similar but less definite association in women than in men. These findings suggest that despite the dangers of heavy drinking, modest alcohol consumption in early-middle age may be associated with a lower risk for HF.

Now there is evidence that beetle resistant pines are growing in their place and the forest will be more diverse, more beautiful, and better off in the long run.

|-| cnxdt5w || 4 || I read something similar awhile ago that had the same idea (synthetic building blocks required for a certain organism to propagate), except they used synthetic nucleotides. 

By designing DNA sequences with synthetic base pairs into the organism of interest, they can ensure, at least beyond a reasonable doubt, that it cannot reproduce without having an external source of those synthetic nucleotides, which are not, as far as we know, found in nature. I suppose both of these techniques (and perhaps an artificial RNA pathway as well) could be used to make mutants with a very short leash. 

Like he says:

&gt; “If you accidentally spill the bacteria into the environment, it’s going to die,” [Ellis] says. “But that DNA is left behind. The genetically modified genes could be incorporated into other bacteria through horizontal transfer,” he warns. “To alleviate all fears, we need to ensure that all genes you add to an organism—say for making insulin or biofuels—are also behind the genetic firewall and somehow encode the 21st amino acid.”

So that problem of gene transfer after cell death could be addressed by one or more synthetic nucleotides placed strategically in the genome. Wild Type bacteria, or any organism for that matter, isn't going to have many opportunities to incorporate environmental DNA that cannot be replicated.  |-|

|-| cnxi1qs || 5 || Personally, I find it difficult to accept the panspermia hypothesis as more than perhaps a curiosity that occurs extremely rarely in the universe, and almost certainly not the origin of life on Earth. To survive the extreme temperature shifts of being launched from a planet, going through interplanetary transit and then crashing down on a new planet would require a level of extremophile beyond any we've found on Earth up to this point.

Another limiting factor that I see is that, on Earth, life seems to have arisen in a more gentle climate. As far as we can tell, we didn't start with extremophiles that became less tolerant as they spread across the planet. We started out with fragile life that eventually flourished into the variety we see today, including extremophiles. An extremophile riding to Earth on an asteroid would have to adapt pretty damn quickly from its native environment to the environment of space, and then to the environment of early Earth in order to survive, and I don't think that's very likely.

Overall, panspermia just complicates the matter for me. It's interesting to think that it may occur rarely or semi-rarely in the universe, but as a hypothesis for the origin of life on Earth, it just shifts the problem of abiogenesis on to another body and doesn't really give us much insight on how life started in the first place. And if life was able to spontaneously start on this other body that seeded ours, surely it's more likely that it started spontaneously on Earth instead? |-|

This was an observational cohort study, not a randomized controlled study.  As the journal article states:

&gt;Because this is an observational cohort without a control group, inferences about causal effects of HCST cannot be made. Definitive conclusions will require a randomized trial; however, this analysis provides the rationale, appropriate patient selection, and therapeutic approach for a randomized study.

Other limitations (as reported by the study) include the fact that many of the patients were compassionate use patients, so they did not directly follow the protocol.  Additionally, longer term data (&gt;4 years) was not available for many of the patients.

To summarize: This is a preliminary study with many limitations.  However, it is promising, and will lead in well to a larger, more controlled study that is being planned.  It is exciting news, but this doesn't mean we have cured MS.  It appears like it may be effective in treating some types of MS, but it is too early to tell.  More research is needed. |-|

Most people have RRMS, and that's what this treatment addresses. There is still no way to treat the more aggressive forms of the disease.

There are a lot of promising ideas on the horizon, and if stem cells aren't the magic bullet, then nanotechnology may come in down the road and be the solution. Of course neither of those things may pan out, but I'd bet on it and lots of smart, rich people have invested a lot of their money in them panning out.

The thing with MS is research is a race against the clock, at least for me. 50% of people are in a wheelchair after 10 years from diagnosis. At the moment, I'm fine, but things can change rapidly. This is not a cure. Wayyyyy more research is needed, especially research outside of pharmaceutical trials looking for more barely effective $70,000/yr. drugs. |-|

is just absolute bullshit

have they been to a competition in which using food is banned? you use your mouth and you better believe the dogs respond to it

some dogs are indifferent to food as a reward just in the same way some are indifferent to toys as a reward and some (but not all ) are indifferent to verbal praise but really, the large majority do respond to it if you use it properly. 

and there are situations where you absolutely don't want to pet your dog instead of using verbal praise. if your dog is in a tense situation and you're trying to sort this, speaking to him can help. touching him can cause him to attack, if he doesn't know it was you and he just feels a sudden touch on him and he' already tense, he'll quite readily attack the other dog. it can be the best way to start a fight. "Oh I just petted him to relax him and he just snapped".  

honestly, every single piece of science and literature that comes out from these so called researchers and psychologists is absolute garbage.

i would love to see how they praised the dogs. probably like most people, empty of anything , no meaning behind it at all. you bet that will get you ignored. it has to be very genuine, which isn't hard for someone who has done it a million times, unlike the people doing the study, clearly.

The only way to convincingly demonstrate multi-exciton generation is to directly measure the current produced by the electrons after absorbing the light, so this research is questionable at best.

Additionally no one would care unless this article had graphene in the title.

Additionally no one has convincingly demonstrated that you can improve the efficiency of an actual device using multi-exciton generation.

- There is no clinical relevance of the chewing gum removing bacteria.  The bacteria removed is not the bacteria implicated in tooth decay or gum disease. 
- Chewing gum frequently can put unnecessary stress on the chewing apparatus.  For most people, this might not matter.  However, many people will develop chronic headaches, muscle/joint pain, or damage teeth because of it.
- Xylitol gum is effective in reducing the incidence of tooth decay.  Part of the reason is that its an undigestible sugar, but the main reason is that its a salivary stimulant and saliva is an effective pH buffer.

|-| cobqg1b || 249 || Dispersing tiny hard particles through a metal to strengthen it is not new - it's commonly used in a variety of alloys, including typical aluminum and titanium alloys used for structural purposes, and is called ["precipitation hardening"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_hardening).  There's even "17-4 PH" precipitation hardened stainless steel.  

All alloys have trade-offs (if one were strictly better we'd just use that for everything).  Titanium alloy is light and very strong, but expensive.  Aluminum alloys are even lighter but less strong (strength/weight not necessarily as good), and are still more expensive than steels, albeit cheaper than titanium.  The cheapest possible steel is heavy and not particularly strong, but is easy to work with and is "good enough" for many applications (e.g. buildings).  More expensive steels are still heavy but can be incredibly strong.  

This new development appears to be an attempt to keep the fairly low cost of steel alloys while reducing the overall density through a high aluminum content and simultaneously increasing the strength, resulting in desirable strength/weight ratios.  The high aluminum content means they have a *lot* of the hard, brittle intermetallic particles, so they had to do some fancy processing trickery to ensure they stayed as well-dispersed tiny particles instead of joining up into great big crunchy brittle areas.  In the article, they not only successfully kept the metal from becoming brittle, but it has much higher toughness (energy absorbed during plastic deformation before ultimate failure) than the titanium alloy they tested it against.  

Whether this takes off will probably depend on whether they can scale up their production method well.  If you can only make it in small batches, I suspect it will end up as yet another more-expensive-but-sometimes-worthwhile high specific strength alloy, but if you can make tons and tons of it they might be onto something very interesting.  Ease of manufacturing is also important- welding is a very popular manufacturing technique, but it can be a pain in the ass on something like this, since letting the metal melt and re-solidify ruins all the careful processing effort you put in to get the microstructure just right.  You could end up with great big brittle precipitates in the heat-affected zone, which would make the weld way less durable than the rest of the metal- never a good position to be in, unless you like your products falling apart at the seams.   |-| 
|-| cobpgat || 50 || Strength to weight is nice, but I wish the article went into the fatigue characteristics of the material. 

If the B2 crystals can't be controlled they will likely be location of micro cracks during fatigue testing. 
 |-| 
|-| cobm01m || 566 || But will it not rust under normal circumstances? That's one of the major selling points of Titanium (and Aluminium) that the thin oxidation layer prevents oxidation of the rest. |-| 
|-| cobk8x4 || 154 || When can I get a bike made out of it?  |-| 
|-| cobqd1x || 20 || **EDIT:** I've gone and looked up the *Nature* article linked to in OP's link; or, at least the abstract and the tables. 9.6% aluminium is an absolute gobful and trying to cast it must be an absolute pain in the arse, as aluminium oxide precipitates float around in the liquid steel and clog the casting nozzles. Also, the precipitate hardening is done during heat-treatment of the cold-rolled steel.


Steelmaker here: so we currently use aluminium (or silicon) in steel to kill (deoxidise) the liquid when pouring it out from the furnace; it's the best deoxidant around and we add up to 0.1% by weight. We also use it for grain refinement (making the microscopic metal crystals smaller) by adding up to 0.03wt%; again, we can use vanadium+nitrogen, niobium/colombium or titanium to achieve the same effect but aluminium is the best grain refiner, or 'microalloy'.

When we roll microalloyed steel (e.g with V &amp; N), we heat-soak it first to ensure that the V and N are fully dissolved, or 'in solution' in the austenite phase (this is the type of crystal structure that steel takes above ~700ºC), we roll at this temperature, where the microalloying ensures the grains don't grow so big as they recrystallize between passes, and then we ensure that the final rolled product is put onto the cooling bed above the solution temperature, where the microalloying limits grain growth, but also forms a fine dispersion of precipitates when the steel cools below the V+N solution temperature. This 'Precipitation hardening' is what the researchers are saying they've done with aluminium.

The thing is, we already use aluminium to precipitate-harden stainless steel and, as above, precipitate-hardening with other microalloys is well-known. I reckon the key bit of research is determining the role of nickel (which is a common alloy in stainless) and applying it to non-stainless steels, and the solution temperatures for rolling.

And finally, a nitpick: stainless and weathering steels are the only steels with oxide coatings. As I mentioned above, we can use silicon for killing the liquid as it's tapped.

The ethics of it all is something that I'll always be torn about, I lost my twin because she was way too tiny. When do you say a child isn't viable? It's not a one size fits all type of thing. Having said that I don't believe premmies who aren't going to make it or are going to have an extremely low quality of life should be kept alive for the sake of it as hypocritical as it sounds since my parents were told I'd most likely never do anything for myself. |-| 
|-| cobc00a || 12 || As someone born almost two months premature, this is pretty fascinating. |-| 
|-| cob7mpc || 141 || This seems to be a steadily growing trend with modern medicine. They're focusing so much on the "can we" that they're not asking "should we" nature works in the way it does for a reason. Is it really ethical to save a premature birth if it means they'll be mentally challenged for the rest of their life? Or to keep an otherwise fatally wounded person on life support just to keep them alive. What about forcing a terminal patient to endure horrible pain until they naturally pass when you had the ability to end their suffering the whole time?  |-| 
|-| cob1wvr || 16 || Not to take away from the neurosciencey thunder, but it's also worth noting as science makes more and more progress in the area of premature birth (imagine artificial wombs!), the law and any relevant medical procedures will be affected heavily (this has already happened, in fact -- fetuses were not recognised as persons under the law previously until birth). Voluntary abortion is the oft-considered issue but I do wonder how necessary medical procedures that could endanger the fetus will be received as we're able to further and further push back the minimal week of gestation.

Or, taken more drastically, if we're later able to support extremely premature fetuses and we can accurately detect any conditions they may have, will it still be accepted to abort the fetus, even if the parents do not wish to take care of a child who may have certain conditions?

|-| cobk8sv || 8 || While this doesn't answer any questions and is merely an anecdote, it is one that frankly surprises me.

My son was born 2 month early after my wife had to be induced as pre-eclampsia was killing her and my son. His lungs hadn't fully developed, he was tiny, and had to live in the NICU for 2 weeks before they let him out. He remained small, and we always felt that he may suffer somewhat from being premature.

Fast forward 12 years, and he is in the 97th percentile for his age (bigger than 97% of his peers at his point in development) and is intellectually and academically very far ahead of his peers as well (he comes from intelligent stock, but we are of average height, my wife is 5'5" and I'm 5'11", though I'm heavily built with much greater than average musculature naturally). Basically, he's not just a freak of nature, but he's a complete freak of nature relative to the expectations of his parents and physicians. He's in all accelerated classes and will be attending a special school for middle school &amp; teenagers who excel in the sciences.

I say none of this to brag, but merely to point out that I too believe that medicine has improved drastically when it comes to premature births. Both he and my wife almost died on the birthing table (not just before), and it was touch and go for a while. We feared brain damage. He, at barely 12, is smarter, more academic, and intellectual than many of our friends (his knowledge oh physics and astronomy is utterly mind-blowing, and he's all self taught, which runs in the family). I know 1 unit does not a data set make, but we are astounded with his development.

I can only hope that others who are able to receive the same decent medical care will also see proper development in their children born prematurely. I do understand that there are many risks. Yet I love to see more and more success stories. |-|

My question is a bit more general: How do you feel non-scientists and/or scientifically uneducated individuals can best approach this kind of research? My concern is that as our technology and scientific knowledge accelerate and accumulate, it will become increasingly difficult for people to 'dabble' in science: discovery will require a determined and lifelong dedication and a stroke of luck.

|-| coawzir || 4 || **tl;dr:** We now have a mathematical model that can show why methane in the martian atmosphere keeps changing instead of dissipating at an expected rate.  This is important because one of the key indicators of active life on Mars was the continued presence of methane in the atmosphere and at variable amounts which previously could have only been explained by an active biological process. You basically showed that a biological process isn't necessary to explain the methane in the atmosphere, but it doesn't say anything about the source of the methane. If anything it seems to indicate that the methane sources are most likely coming from reserves close to the surface which would indicate a biological process created the initial reserve.


**tl;dr of my tl;dr**: The presence of methane in the martian atmosphere doesn't have to indicate that it comes from living sources, but it's likely it's coming from reserves close to the surface that were formed by biological sources.

I'm probably stretching your conclusion a little bit but did I get it right?

By contrast, **inhibition of the same pathway reduced this compulsive sugar-seeking behavior without decreasing food consumption in hungry mice**, suggesting that different neural circuits control feeding in hungry animals.

This is a big finding; it may be preliminary- obviously requires replication with human subjects- but perhaps this circuitry may be implicated in similar behaviors where the organism seeks more superfluous "consumption" beyond satiation. Perhaps sugar, if you will, is only the beginning. In humans, perhaps more complex substances may be sought in an addictive pattern concerning the same neural pathway. |-|

I did read the article, but I am utterly unqualified to value the merits of this research. It looks very ambitious as it sets out to tackle dark matter, dark energy and the big bang singularity. All of which are inferred or hypothetical entities.
 
Less assumptions means a better theory, right?
 
It seems to replace them by granting certain properties to gravitons. These themselves are hypothetical particles, but more conventional models rely om them as well. They mix in "quantum trajectories", which means nothing to me and the article does not try to do much explaining either.
 
The singularity and thus the beginning of time and physics as we know it is avoided, but this results in a model that has no beginning. An infinitely small point is replaced by an infinite amount of time.
 
That is presented as a virtue of this theory, but I am not even certain which option is more satisfying.

"If time was created along with the spatial dimensions beginning at the big bang, how can there be a time that wasn't either after the big bang or at the moment of" will no longer perplex our philosophers / physicists / metaphysicists.

Plus we'll never have to listen to that terrible theme song again. *scoff* ^(What autotroph was ever capable of drooling, anyway?)

More than a few parents said they would not give it to their daughter since it would "encourage sex".

I was literally dumbstruck by the idea. I asked them how that could be true and they said "well if they know it makes sex safer they will have more sex".

I told them the following:

1. Seat Belts make driving safer. Do you drive more recklessly as a result?

2. There is no need to talk about sex at all while dealing with the vaccine. It is a vaccine like many others they get given. They go to the doctor and they are told they need some shots. DONE. If they ask, you tell them it prevents a specific type of cancer. There is no need to even mention sex!

|-| coghjjy || 30 || As far as I know, here in America it wasn't about encouraging risky behavior so much as it was about making sure sex would be punished with disease.

Remember there have been a number of pro-pain, anti-pleasure movements, including the weird anti-anesthetist movement, among others, which stated the fruit of sin is pain and disease, and anything which lessens that pain is thwarting God's will.  People may not say it openly, but they want sex punished.

So it is not so much that inoculation will allow hedonistic behavior, it is that the hedonistic behavior will be unpunished by disease and pain, as they feel it should be.

Pre-edit: I am not a weird Puritan who wants people to suffer.  Everyone should be immunized against anything they can be, and hopefully this anti-immunization craze will blow over, hopefully before the anti-vaccer movement wins the Darwin Award. |-|

The women were average age 20.  As the HPV vaccines were released, the recommendations for screening PAPs changed to reflect the modern understanding of HPV infections, HPV infections in teens never results in cancer.  We don't PAP women under 21 anymore because it has zero effect on cervical cancer risk.  

Additionally, the vaccine(s) target only a portion of the cancer causing sub-types of HPV of which there are at least 15.  The issue of serotype replacement hasn't been examined to any great degree, making the effect on overall cervical cancer rates a great big, ongoing experiment.  

The issue of the vaccine causing teens to be more promiscuous was just a soft topic distracting from the big picture of HPV natural history and the overwhelming effectiveness of the PAP test at reducing cervical cancer mortality (90%,  our best screening test to date)

It also distracts from the blockbuster nature of these biopharmaceutical products.  2.something billion in revenue the 1st quarter of Gardasil's release....

|-| cog3anc || 13 || &gt; Artificial antibody research split subsequently in two directions: one camp pursued creating protein antibodies resulting in what are called monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonals are produced by natural means in a lab and are now commonly used therapeutically. The other camp, in which Spiegel falls, set out to produce smaller, nonprotein compounds with antibodylike properties.

This has actually been split into three directions: Monoclonal antibodies, nonprotein antibody mimetics and high affinity protein antibody mimetics. The latter of the three is the field of research I'm currently working in and it's such a large field (with about 10 drug motifs currently on the market and many more in development) that it seems strange not to mention it.

Also, there is no data in the paper to suggest that these are truly orally bioavailable.

Some formulation work has been done in the field to impart some level of oral bioavailability to peptide drugs it has been a rough road.

|-| cogfu1d || 3 || I'm not sure what to make of this article and all it's talk of codes and deciphering.  I don't know what it means that the virus uses the code to replicate itself or that the virus must figure out how to fold itself.  I think they are talking about using bioinformatics to understand how the structure of the RNA viral genome leads to folding.  They could also be referring to points of the genome where proteins interact to help folding.  

The part in the article talking about Designing molecules that interact with the secret code and scramble it is a little weird as well.  Conceivably, we could make a molecule that could interact the folding spots and bind there inhibiting other interactions.  I'm not sure what it means to scramble the code since it's found in RNA.  If we could easily target just viral RNA, we wouldn't have a problem with the viruses.  It could be a target for pharmaceuticals, but that wouldn't have much to do with scrambling the secret enigma code.

All in all, I find the idea that the RNA has a code other than triplets to amino acids to be iffy.  It seems more likely that they are talking about the structure leading to folding and that is a signal that they can find.

Eta- the abstract does a much better job.  Basically there are signals in the RNA which is recognized by viral proteins for packaging of the RNA.  It is interesting.  Basically some of the same part of the RNA which codes for amino acids also serves as a signal for packaging.  I think it's grandiose to call it a separate embedded code.

As far as I know, newborns don't have a good self-model. They don't even *know* that they have a body as such. Also, they are unable to pass the mirror test until they are about 18 months old. So, I assume that newborns don't have a "self" for about a year after birth: they don't know that *they* exist. And in that sense, for about a year they aren't anybody, there's no "person" inside. "The lights are on, but nobody's home", so to speak.

So, my question is: is it known at what age does "self" emerge in newborns? Are there any standard tests that can show that "there's somebody home" at a given age? |-|

2.) Do you think that all the philosophy of the "hard problem of consciousness" could in fact serve to blind people from understanding the mechanics of the brain above the neuronal level? Could this actually be serving to obscure meaningful questions on the subject? |-| 
|-| coh0ku2 || 3 || I'd be thrilled if you commented on any or all of the below:

1) From the description of your book, and become serotonin is a brain chemical, I think you might have some insight. What can be done about the sexual side-effects of SSRIs (lack of sensitivity/response of genitalia, inability to orgasm)?

2) My husband has a phD in English and is currently taking graduate classes in neuroscience while teaching. He has a couple of theories, which are more complicated than my description of them would have them appear. I was wondering if you could speak to either or both of them. a) He sees oxytocin as a pretty powerful "drug" to which breastfed babies would be addicted. So, he thinks that we should see differences between breastfed and bottle-fed children into adulthood (personality, attachment to other people, how/why they "fall in love").
 
b) He also think that increasing the levels of serotonion in criminals would keep them from repeating. (This is sort of attached to the first question because in my mind, this would at least slightly work for rapists because SSRIs are so very good at killing sexual urges, but maybe someone whose go-to method of evil is rape would probably just switch to a different method. However, my husband would say, I think, that at the right levels the serotonin would inhibit basically anything that would usually have a dopamine "reward.") |-| 
|-| coh0sp4 || 3 || Could you very briefly explain what happens when I push my fingertip against a block of ice? Are the nerves in my fingertip directly connected to a region in the brain that is concerned with this part of the body or is there some sort of routing going on? Is there any preprocessing done in the fingertip (for example regarding the temperature sensation)? Do multiple regions of the brain fire as a result? If so, which regions? Thanks. |-| 
|-| coh0tn9 || 3 || Prof. Linden, Larry Summers once suggested in a speech that it's possible that men and women are slightly different and may learn in slightly different ways. He was vilified and fired from his job as the president of Harvard for saying this. Do you believe that men and women are 100% identical (from a neuroscience perspective) and learn exactly the same way with the same aptitude, or is it possible that men and women are slightly different?  |-| 
|-| coh13o4 || 3 || Hi Dr. Linden,

I am currently a medical student trying to choose between neurology and psychiatry. I would say my dream would be to practice psychiatry in 100 years when the line between neuroscience and psychopathology has been abolished. 

How close do you think we are to the point where the majority of mental illnesses can be explained (and treated) by purely neurological mechanisms?

Also, if we assume that mental illness is purely a manifestation of neurological problems, why do you think that mental therapy alone seems to be very effective for treating some mental illnesses? |-| 
|-| cogz9hj || 4 || Hello Professor, a young, high-school junior here looking to get into Neuroscience- as my college search has just started (and Johns Hopkins is very high on my list) I've been looking at various schools that offer majors in this field, and it's got me wondering- how did you get into this field, what got you interested in neuroscience, and do you still enjoy the field today?

Sorry for the long question, and thanks for your time. Big fan :) |-| 
|-| coh05jb || 3 || Have you done or been part of any research into the Pineal gland? 

If so, what kind? |-| 
|-| coh0knz || 3 || Are mental illnesses caused by chemical imbalances?

 |-| 
|-| coh0meu || 3 || Did you ever smoke weed with any of the following: Johnny Hopkins, Sloane Kettering, or Will Ferrell?

Secondly: my dad was diagnosed maybe ten months or so ago with a stage 4 glioblasteoma (sp?) is there anything in your field that suggests there might be a better way to get an earlier finding of those conditions so that it's not just when the tumor grows so large that it causes seizures, which seems to be the most common way it's found? |-| 
|-| coh16az || 3 || Thank you for doing this AMA!

Regarding the education you received to get to the point you are now, how important was going to the university you went to, and do you have to go to a more prestigious university to become a scientist at your level? |-| 
|-| coh0qnl || -3 || Do you have any advice for a future medical student that will increase my chances of getting into med school? |-|

|-| coh03jy || 6 || "it makes hydrogen. You guys don't have an infrastructure to use hydrogen."

That to me makes very little sense. H2 is amazing in energy density and could just be used in processes like Syn-gas. If this team really has created a way to make H2 without energy intensive electrolysis, then the problem that we don't have H2 cars and power plants will dissipate quickly. 

Why take it a step beyond H2 to make some short hydrocarbon? Just to adapt to the current world?

|-| cogwq2d || 4 || Why do mice always get the cool stuff? I'm sick of constantly having to prick my fingers. I feel like Sleeping beauty, only I don't get to sleep all day.


But to be serious: that would be a great thing to have. Not only is it way more convinient than injections, it also prevents dangerous errors. Sometimes you misjudge the dose you need when injecting insulin and things can get real ugly really fast. A way to keep your blood sugar balanced without constant monitoring would be most welcome. |-| 
|-| cofywy3 || 64 || The study states that the participants had reduced caloric intake, this headline is misleading  |-| 
|-| cofz59d || 8 || What about individuals who go from a healthy omnivorous diet to a vegetarian diet? I'm sure anyone who goes to McDonalds every day will lose a lot of weight if they became vegetarian. Comparing an unhealthy omnivorous diet to a healthy vegetarian diet is as disingenuous as comparing a healthy omnivorous diet to an unhealthy vegetarian diet (which will cause you to gain a lot of weight). |-| 
|-| cog4if6 || 4 || Totally anecdotal, but it worked for me. It's hard to get fat eating salad and beans. |-| 
|-| cofzmsx || 9 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| cofyl35 || 5 || Interesting. I've been losing weight since I left home for college, and was wondering why, this might explain it (I haven't gone totally vegetarian, but for budget reasons meat is infrequent).  |-| 
|-| cofxyfd || 3 || I wonder how much of this is the drastic reduction in "convenience" food.  Most fast food and ready-made food items have meat in them.  I'll say from experience you eat a lot less when you need to cook most of your meals instead of just grabbing a burger at a drive-thru. |-|

|-| cogznp1 || 26 || Cane toads, feral cats and foxes have a lot to do with this, they all have a hand in decimating our small mammal populations.  |-| 
|-| coh02hb || 18 || Good thing we've got a government which cares for the environment and supports the sciences!  |-| 
|-| coh0alk || 12 || well to be fair other places like the US and Europe etc. did their extincting way way before. So its more of a case of Australia being colonised so recently that people are able to properly record this stuff, plus the frailty of species due to isolation. Not saying we shouldn't be doing anything about it though. |-|

|-| cogyx1e || 3 || There are just so many explanations for variances in speed from what they expect them to be, especially when measuring from a distance with instruments that won't be able to detect everything that's there.  Saying it's dark matter causing this is a pretty big assumption. |-| 
|-| cogxbt1 || -5 || And why it is news? Dark matter is everywhere around heavy objects. |-| 
|-| cofzj36 || 31 || ... One would hope so? I mean, I would be sort of put out if I paid four bucks a can for something that *didn't* induce a little hyperactivity. Sort of like seeing "Caution: May cause drowsiness" on a bottle of sleep aids, innit? |-|

|-| cog4sn1 || 3 || isn't that the point of energy drinks? |-| 
|-| coghwq3 || 7 || Fascinating finding. I do not understand how that coordinates with the reality that neuroscience indicates that our brains weigh negative things with twice the importance of positive things. As the negative things are more likely to kill or harm an individual that makes sense to me. 
Does this article indicate that we create more positive words to attempt to balance that weighting out?  |-|
