|-| cntthbh || 7 || Nonsense. The more Sherlock, the better.  |-| 
|-| cnttklw || 1364 || More than 3 episodes every two years certainly wouldn't hurt though. |-| 
|-| cntu5wb || 27 || NBC be like "can we just re-do our old shit too?" |-| 
|-| cntu6eq || 4 || Yeah I finished the series, but it was mostly for Mort/Maura.  The kids were insufferable.  I'm not sure I'd watch more but idk. |-| 
|-| cnturck || 308 || The last season already achieved that.

I'd rather see them take a few years between seasons than rush everything and ruin the show. |-| 
|-| cntv9vp || 35 || I just binged on all the episodes!  Wow, why didn't I start watching this sooner? |-| 
|-| cntvml8 || 9 || I NEED a Prison Break reboot. Let's hope it happens |-| 
|-| cntw0t4 || 9 || inb4 someone demands more Firefly with the ageing actors. |-| 
|-| cntwjch || 62 || The amusing part of this is that folks are getting pissy over Martin not wanting to make fans happy and devote his whole life to pumping out more Sherlock (cause apparently die hard fans of this show define their lives by it). Forget what Martin or Benedict want, forget that they have lives. Forget that Benedict is about to have his first child and might want to spend time with the baby. 

Why is this amusing. Well cause Sir Arthur went though his own version of this. He got bored with writing Sherlock and wanted to work on other ideas. But he knew he couldn't stop writing Sherlock without a lot of fussing unless the man was dead. So he pitched Sherlock over a waterfall. And since fans would freak if great villain Moriarty was out there running amok, he tossed Moriarty over as well. Kill them both and be done with it. Eight years of fans screaming and he released Hounds but since it took place in the earlier years they still werent happy. So after two more years of "WTW" he wrote more stories starting with Sherlock's 'just kidding' return from the dead |-| 
|-| cntwkdv || 366 || That whole Watsons wife angle annoyed me to be honest that character was unlikable
 |-| 
|-| cntwokj || 162 || I read that as Morgan Freeman and was really confused as to why he'd care. |-| 
|-| cntwr67 || 119 || Glad to hear he is still working after Lethal Weapon movies |-| 
|-| cntwtdd || 8 || Donald Glover is an inspiration.  |-| 
|-| cntx7ft || 317 || I really enjoy Donald Glover.  But it seems like every TV show that stars a comedian I enjoy ends up being a big swing and a miss.  I really hope it leans more towards being like "Louie" and less like "Mulaney."  FX seems to do alright with their comedy though, so I remain hopeful. |-| 
|-| cntxayt || 9 || "Should Fox do another season of “24”, Kiefer Sutherland is unlikely to reprise his role of Jack Bauer,"

Then don't make any more. Live Another Day was a good ending anyway. 24 is nothing without Jack Bauer, you'd have to bring him back and if you recast him it'd be nowhere near as good. |-| 
|-| cntxcdh || 22 || Feels like he has been working on this forever and it's still not even made? |-| 
|-| cntxdpr || 15 || Maybe that's a nice way of saying he recognizes season 3 was bad and the scripts for season 4 aren't looking too great either. |-| 
|-| cntxj7b || 13 || Vince Gilligan from X-Files = Breaking Bad.  Just saying, new content from writers who are already proven to be talented is what we should be hoping for, not a rehash of shows that went out with their dignity (mostly) in tact.   |-| 
|-| cntxk7z || 143 || If they hadn't made season 3 the show could be reckoned as one of the best shows ever on the level or better than breaking bad.Season 3 fucking Tumblrified the series. |-| 
|-| cntxkuf || 133 || Having fans at the shoot probably lowers the enjoyment. He already says he doesn't like shooting with fans applauding around. Imagine having to do that for many months every year.  |-| 
|-| cntxp23 || 14 || The weird thing is I don't think you're meant to relate to the children in the traditional sense. There's a sense that despite Mort/Maura being the one who's having this metamorphic period and reassimilating herself into society, the kids are the ones that are having legitimate crises of identity. In many ways, you can see the roots of what lead them to this point - it's given to us in flashbacks that there were points where their parents barely had a presence, and that led to their development in skewed directions. For the most part, they're spoiled and narcissistic because they've mostly had to care for themselves. They were allowed to do as they pleased for the most part is the sense I got from that flashback-centered episode where Ali doesn't want her Bat Mitzvah and gets her way; Josh is off sleeping with a woman twice his age; and Sarah is off being all civil rights-minded while not actually doing anything significant. 

That leads to this really poor image of these children in the present, of them not supporting their father in this time or being too centered on themselves or how Mort/Maura's coming out is affecting them, yet Mort was preoccupied with finding his place in the world in their youth. 

That's not to say that any of this is justified or even well-developed enough to draw some serious conclusions, but even if I can't relate to the children's actions, I somewhat understand why they may have become this way. In that way, I think there's some realism to it, even if most of what you're saying is true and that their drama is not as compelling as Mort/Maura's.

That said, I don't think it's fair to compare Transparent with the Breaking Bads or Shields because this series is much more grounded. I don't think Walt, Nucky, or Vic are particularly compelling or relatable characters either, but of course their series are high-concept and you're not meant to scrutinize it at the same level as Transparent.  |-| 
|-| cntxtex || 92 || I'm glad. Season 3 was garbage. It's a shame they appealed it to their teenage fanbase.  |-| 
|-| cntxtm6 || -3 || People always talk about Sherlock in terms of "Two years between seasons!". That misses the point. Look at it this way: they've released 10 Sherlock films in 3 and a half years. That's nuts. Can you think of any other films series that has put that much content out that quickly? *And then* on top of that, Cumberbatch has won multiple awards for his stage work, multiple awards for his film acting, appeared in enormous films like 12 years a slave and Star Trek. Freeman has starred in an enormous hollywood trilogy, the last of the cornetto trilogy and is raising two kids!

Meanwhile the writers were writing Doctor Who!

How much do you want from them! |-| 
|-| cntxw30 || -18 || Donald Glover is whiter than a GAP ad. |-| 
|-| cnty8ma || 4 || Top gear? |-| 
|-| cntyewx || -12 || Wtf, he left Community because he said he wanted to focus on his music career then makes a pilot... |-| 
|-| cntyhz5 || 26 || He should have shared this attitude with Peter Jackson regarding the hobbit. |-| 
|-| cntyi0s || 16 || I think of it like the George RR Martin situation.

I don't want anything rushed out if it would compromise the quality, but if the same quality of finished product was pumped out every few hours or so, I would quit my job and modify my couch into a toilet. |-| 
|-| cntyr3t || 102 || I'll watch, but I really wish he'd go back to community |-| 
|-| cntyr4f || 3 || If this show sucks, it's going to ruin Donald Glover for me. |-| 
|-| cntyro9 || 32 || Any fellow dong lover fans here? |-| 
|-| cntyx0e || 76 || Hasn't this been announced like 3 or 4 times at this stage? |-| 
|-| cntyyy4 || 6 || Isn't this like 3 month old news.  |-| 
|-| cntyzv1 || 39 || Why is there so much season 3 hate in here? I thought it was fantastic. The first episode was exactly what it needed to be, the second episode was meh (but so were the middle eps of the last 2 seasons) and the last episode was easily the second best out of all 9 episodes. Seriously season 3 is way better than season 1. Don't understand the hate. |-| 
|-| cntz36k || 6 || 24 without Kiefer Sutherland? NO WAY! Kiefer and Mary Lynn are the only people that gave the recent seasons of 24 an original feel. The show would be nothing without the real Jack. i wouldn't be upset if Live Another Day was the last installment of 24, but I'm dying to know what happens to Jack after the Russians took him, and I wanted to see Tony one more time &lt;/3. Maybe a movie? I know there's been some discussion about a movie over the past couple years.  |-| 
|-| cntz74s || 6 || I'm like halfway through right now, and I'm very taken with it. I find the dynamic between Maura and the kids really troubling because I can kind of relate to it. I always wonder if as I've grown up, I've become too narcissistic and detached from my parents, and a bad son. I find it interesting to grapple with the question of at what point are you supposed to start seeing your parents as real people to whom you have a lot to offer and to whom your support means a lot, rather than just your parents. The show lays bare how easy it is for even well-meaning children to be deeply hurtful without meaning to as they grow older. I think it's brutal, brilliant, and very powerful. |-| 
|-| cntzdzl || 5 || How many more prisons can they break out of? Great show, but it ran it's course.  |-| 
|-| cntzfjj || 18 || Its appeal is the story and the acting. Unless they *really* Think that they can't write *more* without sacrificing quality, I disagree with them.

The appeal certainly isn't a scarcity of episodes. I blitzed through the entire series thus-far within 4 days. I am not 'pleased' with the fact that there were so few.
 |-| 
|-| cntzl50 || -8 || Sherlock is just one of those shows you can really only enjoy if you are a 13 year old tumblr girl. If you have any taste move on now. |-| 
|-| cntzn5h || 30 || I see this being more of a dark comedy which makes me even more excited. Like a visual reflection of some of the stuff he tries to portray with his music and screenplay.  |-| 
|-| cntzsb9 || 20 || In the meantime, Elementary is a pretty good supplement. I was pretty skeptical of premise when it first came out, but Johnny Lee Miller and Lucy Lu have a good on screen chemistry and the writing is pretty solid too. 

It's more of a police procedural than Sherlock is, but stays pretty true to the basic formula of Sherlock Holmes.  |-| 
|-| cntzy6d || 5 || The "yay, we're all psychopaths" writing already did that.  |-| 
|-| cnu02r4 || 18 || This show has been "in the works" for the longest time. Hopefully Donald has been working it all out. He has been part of nothing but great shows (The Daily Show, 30 Rock, Community) so I give him full benefit of the doubt. |-| 
|-| cnu0318 || 3 || I powered  through prison break until s3e7? Spoiler the girlfriend is in on the plot and i said no thats enough and never went back. Netflix is convinced Ima watch it someday but that's not gonna happen. I can only take so much |-| 
|-| cnu0rfm || 13 || Freeman's on Fargo? I should check that out. |-| 
|-| cnu0ytb || 6 || I dunno that last series was pushing it too far - especially that scene in the subway.  |-| 
|-| cnu21wa || 32 || Season 3 might have been to self-referential and "tumblery", but the wedding episode was some of the best writing out of the entire series.    The wedding episode had 3-4 multiple layers of mysteries going on at once. It was quick, clever, rich, and lots of hidden details.   I don't use tumbler so I don't really give a shit about what teenage girls do.   The writing was high quality television and you know it. |-| 
|-| cnu29p6 || 8 || Robin Lord Taylor is doing a great job and is the best part of the show. I think Gotham is a good show, but I hope it gets better so more people will watch it. |-| 
|-| cnu2cwd || -15 || man, this guy is very overrated.  |-| 
|-| cnu2t5j || 6 || Just give T-Bag his own show, that would be great. |-| 
|-| cnu37qs || 9 || They both have been doing well with their movie careers, Martin Freeman or Benedict Cumberbatch don't need Sherlock anymore. That's the real reason and it's completely understandable. |-| 
|-| cnu3adb || 20 || How does this guy always get roles? He's been in about a half dozen failed TV shows since Arrested Development. |-| 
|-| cnu3bio || 25 || Well, I totally and completely disagree.

The show always mixed comedy and drama with sarcastic, cynical criticism of the "corporate consultant" industry. It's still doing that, and I think it's doing that very well. It was never a "comedy", but humor was one way to mock that industry and the people in it.

Each of the actors in the main roles is exceptionally good. Don Cheadle is amazing. Kristin Bell is spectacular. The others are great too, each in a different way. They each mock that industry as examples of the pathetic humanity that works there.

Yes, they are losers. They always were. The industry they work in is corrupt, horrible, and pointless. The people in it are no better. To me, that's what the show is about, and always was about.
 |-| 
|-| cnu3jh0 || 3 || Season 3 should never have happened in the first place. 
It didn't even hold a candle to the first two, except for some flickerings throughout the three episodes.

The end of season 2 was a perfect ending to 'Sherlock'. |-| 
|-| cnu3us4 || 4 || I kinda agree. I mean, think about House. Everyone jokes about how each episode consists of the main characters jerking each other off until House has his epiphany. With 13 episodes per year, Sherlock too would devolve into a predictable episode structure. 

That being said House is a much more interesting character than Sherlock anyway. |-| 
|-| cnu3vg8 || 4 || More 'Sherlock' like Season 3 'Sherlock' would make the show lose a lot of its appeal, yes. |-| 
|-| cnu3w8i || -3 || Wow, people are really not giving up on this guy. |-| 
|-| cnu3zx4 || 20 || say WHHHHAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTT? |-| 
|-| cnu4aj3 || 12 || Well I fucking hope they go somewhere with this. Ive been waiting for something... anything.. to bring some closure to that epic cliff hanger since jr high. |-| 
|-| cnu4h0d || 3 || It already lost a lot of it's appeal, as Series 3 was uninspired and contrived. |-| 
|-| cnu4r9k || -4 || I have yet to see something that will change my mind, but I just don't find Donald Glover as appealing as (a lot of) reddit seems to.

To be fair I don't like his genre of music, anyway, so it has nothing to do with him.

His comedy, though, is awful.

I'd say he's probably better as a writer based on his credentials, but his stand-up is just some rambling, try-hard, nerd/geek/awkward schtick that was old and tired before it ever debuted. |-| 
|-| cnu4wf7 || 5 || I loved Transparent. Unlike the OP, I don't need crime and murder for me to consider a show as having high stakes. The Pfeffermans are, in their dysfunction, one of the most genuine set of characters I've seen on television in a long while. It feels like a real family to me, a family that fights but dances, that bickers and eats BBQ together. It captures details that I think shows like Parenthood leaves out. And the acting, good golly: Tambour is great, the three kids are very well-defined. As much as I hated Josh, Jay Duplass nails it so well. Same with the other kids. And let's not forget Judith Light, who is radiant in her small amount of screen time.

Also, episode 8 was one of the most interesting episodes of TV I've seen in a while, where Ali has her strange flash-back encounter. But it's definitely not for everyone. It also blurs the line between comedy and drama. |-| 
|-| cnu4zm7 || 24 || First I was expecting a quirky romantic comedy.

Then I was like, whoa, is this going to get dark?

Then I was like WHOA he done showed that kid

Then I was like, wait, they're making a whole story line out of this?

Then I was like, wait, are people going to die? Are they seriously going to "destroy" each other in court? 

Then I was like, hey, this all seems infuriatingly melodramatic and I might be better off never watching it.

Roller coaster of emotions. 

As needlessly intense as Zachary Quinto's eyebrows.

 |-| 
|-| cnu5bru || 15 || Wow, three Netflix originals with Will Arnett: Arrested Development Season 4, Bojack Horseman, and now this. I can't complain, I've been a big fan of him since Arrested Development.  |-| 
|-| cnu5buv || 7 || Prison Break will only work if they do something like American Horror Story in which each season, is an entirely new story with the actors/actresses playing different people. |-| 
|-| cnu5hyg || 3 || Just gonna let it out there, I think Elementary does a fantastic job each season, as a 24 ep. show. Not as brilliant as Sherlock, but hey that's what you get when you have more eps |-| 
|-| cnu6f5p || 16 || So many haters in dis thread. I guess Bino so insensitive she askin " why he say that?" |-| 
|-| cnu6kh7 || 9 || Hopefully it's better and more successful than The Millers... and Up All Night... and Running Wilde. |-| 
|-| cnu6ksr || 3 || Jonny Lee Miller is the superior Holmes by a large margin so I don't mind if Cumberbatch wants to continue making his career in mediocre and oscar bait films instead. |-| 
|-| cnu6n62 || 10 || It's always been a comedy-drama, and there were more jokes before because there were lower stakes for the characters. Sometimes shows take a dark turn. I'm still loving every minute of it. |-| 
|-| cnu6t4o || -6 || I hope it's good enough to make up for ruining *Community* |-| 
|-| cnu75s4 || 9 || This show has the greatest opening music. |-| 
|-| cnu7awh || 7 || I'll check it out only to see just how absurdly long they can stretch it, even if it's just a miniseries. |-| 
|-| cnu7snn || 7 || Wait this isn't a joke? |-| 
|-| cnu7w80 || 3 || Season three made it lose its appeal, IMO |-| 
|-| cnu83ih || 3 || I have to disagree.  Hannibal, Fargo, etc are good shows with many episodes.


Elementary is a good show as well, altho not as good as Sherlock, and it has a very long season-24 compared to just 3 episodes.


But maybe he is saying it works best for him and BC because of their movie careers.  In that vein it makes more sense. |-| 
|-| cnu8rfm || 4 || I'm not sure how this is going to turn out, since it's on NBC, but you should really try and get your hands on the Australian version and the novel. It was absolutely incredible to watch. Dark, sexy, emotionally engaging and just an incredible story told from a range of perspectives, I genuinely don't know how NBC is going to get away with some of the stuff in the original series.

Also anyone got a non-US link? |-| 
|-| cnu9jlu || -3 || DonG...

...lover. |-| 
|-| cnu9q86 || 10 || I loved 'The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret' (btw for fans who didn't know it's returning in 2015) so I'm pretty interested in seeing this.  |-| 
|-| cnu9y15 || 8 || I watched the original Australian version last fall when I first heard of the American version, each episode focuses on a different character and their infidelities and parenting and stuff. It was pretty good and I look forward to see how it's adapted here. |-| 
|-| cnua751 || 5 || Its fun.  I always loved the story of the Three Musketeers, and although the show isn't exactly what I imagine the life of the Musketeers was outside the storied adventures, I am finding it very enjoyable.  The characters are charming and handsome and there's lots of action and adventure.  |-| 
|-| cnubbnf || 3 || this could be good. also a kind of scrubs reunion (again, after the one on cougar town). |-| 
|-| cnubfcv || 3 || I'm loving it. Season 3 was the best yet. I just wish Don cheadle broke the 4th wall more like in season one.  |-| 
|-| cnubmv2 || 7 || Fox fucking up a show? Shocking! |-| 
|-| cnubyhe || -13 || thank you cartoon network!  what a seriously stupid show... |-| 
|-| cnucdf1 || 56 || I didn't burst out into laughter until the Mac and Dennis by a Timeshare one where Frank tells Dee to flip it upside down.  |-| 
|-| cnuche7 || 9 || This feels like a parody of a show and it's hilarious to me that this is actually lasting 1 episode. He slapped a kid because the kid tried to straight wreck another kids head with a bat and kicked him in the leg.  
  
Yeah, the slap was overkill but jesus christ.  |-| 
|-| cnucjod || 11 || "Overly serialized?" Holy fuck, these people really are living in the past. I mean, we all suspected it, but here they are coming out and saying it. 

News flash, TV execs. Nobody gives a fuck about procedural television except old people. Stop meddling. |-| 
|-| cnudd4t || 13 || I love Steven Universe. 

I love the Gems, I love the fact that they fuse, I love their personalities.

I also enjoy the overall storyline they have been building concerning the Gems, who they are and where they came from, and would hate if the show got cancelled before we could see the conclusion. |-| 
|-| cnude9t || 19 || Not surprising. They did the same to Young Justice, Beware the Batman,  and Green Lantern, but also took them completely off the schedule (or put them on early morning).  |-| 
|-| cnudhyg || 24 || Wow that's a lot of goddammits. I have noticed myself saying it alot more since I started watching this show.  |-| 
|-| cnudo0h || 4 || He was hilarious in the Bob Odenkirk directed "Let's Go To Prison". |-| 
|-| cnudqg9 || 4 || "The uploader has not made this video available in your country."

WTF! |-| 
|-| cnudqs5 || 3 || Everyone wants to be CBS. The only thing I can stand watching on there is Person of Interest and even that gets annoyingly procedural. |-| 
|-| cnudxq9 || 154 || I've been rewatching all of It's Sunny over the past week, god damn the show is brilliant. For an 'outsider' watching the show for the first time, it might seem like a really dumb show, but it's incredibly smart and witty.

Looking forward to more god damn its! |-| 
|-| cnueee2 || 11 || Cartoon network has a habit of sabotaging any show with substance on the network. Sometimes due to network politics and sometimes for giggles. |-| 
|-| cnuep14 || 10 || ive watched every episode over the years and so many scenes in there i dont remember... time for a rewatch I guess. |-| 
|-| cnuf4lu || 26 || Some one should do a "Jesus Christ" version of this for Sons of Anarchy. The video would be hours long but still. |-| 
|-| cnuff47 || 14 || forgive me father for mine ears hath heard SIN |-| 
|-| cnufq5q || 4 || I have never wanted anything more in my life. |-| 
|-| cnufub3 || 4 || When he's good he's fantastic, like GOB from AD or Devon Banks in 30 Rock. |-| 
|-| cnug18q || 3 || I know this isn't a popular opinion, and please note that this is strictly my subjective opinion, but I really have little hope for this series. If it was Donald Glover back in 2009-2011 (Dong Lover) then maybe it would be pretty good, but now that Glover has taken on this serious artist persona -I really just don't know. I hope it's not like 'Louie', way too many people are trying to copy him and it doesn't work out. We don't need another 'Louie' because that show is already incredible and so original to begin with. I don't know, I hope he's able to tap back into that silliness we saw in his Derrick Comedy/GambinoX/30 Rock days.  |-| 
|-| cnugpij || 8 ||  That's a shame. My 4 year old loves Stephen Universe. After Watermelon Stephen aired, he spent days carrying a stuffed lion in his Jammies. The fact that Baby Melon sacrificed himself for Stephen had a really profound effect on my son.  |-| 
|-| cnugwu1 || 3 || I really can't wait to see this. I love AD, Todd Margaret, and Bojack Horseman is very good for those that haven't checked it out. |-| 
|-| cnuhbuc || 12 || I like Rebecca Sugar, I think she did a great job on all her adventure time episodes, *I remember you* is easily the best entry in the show. So while I definitely think Steven Universe has the potential to be great, it *just* barely misses the mark for me. The animation and voice acting are both great, and there's a ton of charm in the character design. It's hard to pinpoint, but somehow there just seems to be something missing. Maybe if it had more than 11 minutes an episode, or if it was able to commit itself as a drama rather than trying to also balance its elements as a sitcom it would do better. Anyway, I've still liked the first season, and I hope Cartoon Network has the sense to keep it over the travesty that has been *Uncle Grandpa*. |-| 
|-| cnui5u6 || 3 || That third season though...ugh... |-| 
|-| cnujj7r || 7 || No doubt that it would be a very special clone high. |-| 
|-| cnukf2c || 8 || I uh, would like a uh partay PLATTA! |-| 
|-| cnukjpb || 4 || I found Wentworth Miller to be bland during Prison Break's run, but having not seen any of his other acting work, I'm not sure if he's the one to blame for that. Purcell on the other hand, I quite enjoyed. |-| 
|-| cnukvkg || 3 || tbh Sherlock lost it's appeal by season 2. 
2 years of hype doesn't make up for average scripts. |-| 
|-| cnul0bz || 79 || &gt;Can we cannot base our decisions on what does and doesn't happen in episodes of Scooby Doo, goddammit?

Dennis' delivery on this line never fails to crack me up. |-| 
|-| cnumat0 || -3 || I know how,it premiered on the cw where they have a huge audience of suckers who will watch about anything. |-| 
|-| cnumk17 || 3 || I'd be so pumped for this...Wesley. |-| 
|-| cnun3hf || 3 || I do like this show, but honestly I rather it be this show on the chopping block than Adventure Time or Regular Show. I would prefer Uncle Grandpa but I can live with Steven Universe. |-| 
|-| cnuns7e || 29 || You'll notice there are 2-3 instances of "God dammit, Frank/Dee" -- there are at least twenty of "God dammit, Charlie!"

Poor Charlie can never catch a break. :( |-| 
|-| cnuo4v0 || 3 || They should do a kickstarter to turn this into a web series or something if Cartoon Network kills it. |-| 
|-| cnuokos || 12 || Never seen Its Always Sunny before? 

Watch this! You'll be [smitten!](http://youtu.be/5fP4emqw7O4) |-| 
|-| cnupdcz || -3 || What? Amazing show?  This is just a show trying to take advantage of the success of Adventure time and Regular Show.  It's not funny or clever, and it's right next to Uncle Grandpa at the bottom of the trash where it belongs. |-| 
|-| cnuqjjh || 3 || I really wanted to like this show. I just couldn't get into it. Bee &amp; PuppyCat is way better and funnier. |-| 
|-| cnuru1e || 4 || who isn't? |-| 
|-| cnus4rg || -9 || ofcourse its going to be inorder, the most effiecent way to edit it all down would be from ep 1  to ep 1000 |-| 
|-| cnuslvr || 11 || O ya this is what everybody wanted. I was worried at first but i now see the light |-| 
|-| cnuss41 || -8 || I hated the asian guy so i was glad when the three of them left, didnt like the other two either really.  |-| 
|-| cnustlr || 3 || I like Sleepy Hollow and if they drop the serialization I will quit watching. We don't need a freak of the week kind of show where you have to wait until sweeps to get back into the storyline. I already watched X-files and have no interest in that kind of show-structure again. |-| 
|-| cnuszyf || 3 || I don't like the overstylized look this season. With the filter and everything it seems they're trying too hard to look hip, but Mythbusters is best when it embraces its geekiness. It feels off to me. |-| 
|-| cnuu4xq || 4 || Is it bad that I waited for one of them specifically? The one where Frank pours red wine in Dee's shoe.  |-| 
|-| cnuuil8 || 5 || By "new Mythbusters formula" I guess you mean the original Mythbusters formula.  Pretty sure people should have seen that things would get off track as they started adding more and more cast members.  I get that Adam and Jamie are/were busy so they needed fill-ins for when they couldn't flim content, but as a Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell once declared, "Ain't nothin' like the real thing baby...".  That show only got as popular as it did because of Adam and Jamie, so it's good that it's back to it's roots.  I suppose the younger viewers will see it as new, but those of us that have been watching since the beginning certainly welcome back the simplicity that made the show great to begin with. |-| 
|-| cnuuzre || 21 || In case any of you are wondering "God damn it" is said approximately 204 times.  I counted instead of studying for my civil procedure class.  Worth it. |-|

|-| cnuymsf || 187 || The only way this won't be terrible is if they're just mean about it. That's not really the point of a roast but seeing people kiss up to this guy would be intolerable. |-| 
|-| cnuyorg || 2479 || I don't like this.  It's all an effort to make people like him more, and I'm against that. 

Nearly every celeb who's come in contact with the guy says he's a huge douchebag.  This "roast" will only serve to make him more likable in the public's eyes.

Let's not cast any doubt that this man is a Dick of epic proportions by carrying out with this.  |-| 
|-| cnuyv5v || 13 || Spit Roasted? |-| 
|-| cnuywb3 || 124 || seriously just light him on fire. roast over. |-| 
|-| cnuyxn2 || 47 || Getting *paid* to make fun of Justin Bieber seems pretty effortless |-| 
|-| cnuyxsg || 1047 || Celebs tend to go for the Roast after people already have completely panned them in society. Donald Trump, Charlie Sheen, etc.  I don't think this will do much to help the Biebs. I think they're just gonna shit all over him. Which is great. |-| 
|-| cnuyz0w || 1220 || I really really really hope they roast him as hard as they can. I'm not talking "Ouch, what a burn" type of jokes, I'm talking "Holy shit can they say that!?" type of jokes. |-| 
|-| cnuz1ua || 10 || I'd love to see the same crew as James Franco's roast. 

Except for James Franco  |-| 
|-| cnuz6c3 || 2307 || Eminem should be one of the roasters.  |-| 
|-| cnuz8qj || 943 || Still not going to watch it. Roasts are suppose to be for legends who people actually adore, don't even have to say whats its for today |-| 
|-| cnuz991 || 776 || Who cares? |-| 
|-| cnuz9xg || 27 || Roasts just hit an all-time low. And they roasted Flavor Flav if I'm not mistaken. |-| 
|-| cnuzaf1 || 9 || The guy hasn't released an album in years.  He's still famous because you people keep talking about him. |-| 
|-| cnuzapd || 27 || Is it 1997 again? Way to comeback guys! |-| 
|-| cnuzbdv || 13 || He has shown he has no sense of humour and is a poor communicator. Don't worry everyone, this will surely bring out the inner D Bag in him.  |-| 
|-| cnuzgft || 20 || They better do a skit about OZ. |-| 
|-| cnuzgtf || 89 || Hope Anthony Jeselnik is a roaster. |-| 
|-| cnuznsa || 11 || Everything is terrible. Everything. It's becoming a world of unbearable garbage. Even the internet is just...garbage. A bunch of click-bait trash.

With that being said.

I hope Greg Giraldo comes back to life just to tear him to pieces for an hour. |-| 
|-| cnuzph6 || 13 || He's been waiting to be the butt of a joke?  Does he never go online?  That's all he ever is. |-|

|-| cnuzwmk || 31 || The only people who hate him are just as bad as his fanbase. Adults don't really give two shits about teen boyband popstars who are popular with preteen girls. |-| 
|-| cnuzwsm || 9 || I heard he was using he popularity of the show to locate his missing son hank  |-| 
|-| cnuzy85 || 5 || Who cares? |-| 
|-| cnv00sy || 5 || Ever since the Donald Trump Roast, I quit giving a shit.

The idea of a roast was supposed to be to bust the chops of someone who is loved and respected. 

People like Biebs and Trump should just be ignored at best or put in bags and dropped in a river at worst, but should never be "honored". 

Fuck Comedy Central for devaluing the term "roast" to mean "pandering to stupid people who love vulgar, hackey insult comedy performed by people who don't give a shit about the roastee, but just a paycheck." |-| 
|-| cnv02j3 || 27 || "This is going to be awesome!"

|-| cnv041t || 84 || I hope they have J. Jonah Jameson appear on the weekend update.  |-|

|-| cnv0ajg || 4 || Grr, I grown man. Bieber make me angry |-| 
|-| cnv0era || 3 || Why waste air time? Save this for something useful. The internet already roasts him on a daily basis. |-|

I want a Crucifixion. |-| 
|-| cnv0oc7 || 8 || I hope he's really funny on it so all the stupid man-children and shit comedians can stop talking about how much they hate him and think it's remotely funny. |-| 
|-| cnv15we || 3 || This kid isn't mature enough to handle a roast.  |-| 
|-| cnv165z || 10 || This begs the question:

Why oh why hasn't Mel Brooks been roasted?! |-| 
|-| cnv1e2a || 34 || I, for one, can't wait to see how they parody *Whiplash*. |-| 
|-| cnv21l4 || 3 || He doesn't seem like a person who can take a joke |-|

|-| cnv2an8 || 7 || ATTENTION COMEDY CENTRAL:

**SNL's Kate McKinnon (in Bieber costume) is a must for the show.** |-| 
|-| cnv2att || 8 || If they charged a flat fee of 19.99 rather than some high daily rate I think this would be great. I have a feeling though it will be very expensive and bought by mostly high end customers. |-|

|-| cnv2i3d || 20 || I won't watch, I don't care.  The only way to get rid of him is to pretend he doesn't exist. |-|

|-| cnv2xyd || 22 || Without Greg Giraldo, what is the point? |-|

|-| cnv3ved || 3 || I thought I was in /r/TheOnion/ for a minute |-| 
|-| cnv4v0u || 3 || They should find that prostitute that put pics of him on Instagram or something be one of the roasters.  |-| 
|-| cnv4x10 || 3 || I hope he doesn't take this to mean that he is popular or that people like him. |-| 
|-| cnv5j4r || 4 || He looks jacked in that picture. |-| 
|-| cnv5pzs || 4 || I have watched every CC roast. This will be the first that I will never watch. Like many have said, he does not deserve any honors.  |-| 
|-| cnv5qec || 4 || Oh wow a CC roast. He sure is in trouble. /s


 |-| 
|-| cnv5yv9 || 11 || It was amazing for any of those wondering if they should watch it. It probably was the best episode of the entire series. It is a huge shame season 6 is so far off.  |-| 
|-| cnv68pp || 3 || If only Greg Giraldo were still alive. He would tear Bieber into a thousand assholes. |-| 
|-| cnv6gqi || 6 || Jon Stewart pretty much took a poop on Mike Huckabee throughout that entire interview |-| 
|-| cnv71g7 || 4 || I was under the impression that being roasted was an honor, for, you know, accomplished individuals, not fuck ups. |-| 
|-| cnv729v || 6 || Bet he can't hang. 

I bet he gets super angry and makes himself look bad. |-| 
|-| cnv78vi || 10 || &lt;---biggest Back to the Future fan ever,  the cartoon was not good.  |-| 
|-| cnv7baq || 3 || As a kid i remember it being kind of lame. It was the docs kids getting into trouble with the time machines and the kid and doc having to help them out. Doc of course acts like an imbecile that doesn't know anything but science and it was kind of lame, and thus why it failed so quick.

Now Exo-Squad was frigging awesome and ended on a puzzling note when it should have ended on a better finite note. Of course it was a cartoon filled with Nazi like allegory as well as Holocaust allegory at the same time which made it richly dark (and humanity gets it butt kicked a few times in the show as nothing ever pans out easy) while still being an awesome shoot-em up super suit fest. And the action figures were cool for the ten and under crowd and there was a Sega game for it. |-| 
|-| cnv7kkc || 3 || I hope Mike ["The Situation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gfhM4_ogwo) makes an appearance. 

Beware - That video is CRINGEWORTHY.  |-| 
|-| cnv7oqz || 47 || Roasts should be held for people who have been in show business for a while. It should be an honor to be roasted. Justin Bieber has only been in for 6 years, I want to see him roasted in 20 years when he's cringing at his past. |-| 
|-| cnv7yrt || 3 || Star Wars: The Clone Wars has a very similar feel to it. I'm not a big fan of the first season, but it gets a lot better from there. |-| 
|-| cnv83z0 || 6 || This is going to sound messed up but I'd rather see his roast in 20 years. Let him go through 2 divorces, a manslaughter charge, drug felony and bankruptcy. He's too young to have a "roast".  |-| 
|-| cnv89uo || 3 || I'm watching Full Metal Alchemist (on Netflix streaming), and there are a lot of similarities. |-| 
|-| cnv8gwu || 3 || it's about he docs kids and their adventures. there isn't really a story to this show. |-| 
|-| cnv8iys || 3 || This was amazing and I had no idea it existed. Thanks so much for posting it! |-| 
|-| cnv8j6n || 9 || Cyrogenically freeze yourself until Bryke come out with something new like the rest of us. |-| 
|-| cnv8k1i || 9 || Not really in the same vein, but also a very good American-produced animated series which aired concurrently with LoK is Young Justice. They were both much more mature than their target audience would lead you to believe, with YJ featuring some pretty dark themes and developments. It gets a bit too big for its britches at the start of season 2, but it leveled out as the season continued. I'm pretty salty about it having ended so soon, but I guess I could say the same for Korra.

Otherwise, I would turn to anime. Some of the quintessential series:

* Hunter x Hunter
* Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood 
* Death Note
* Attack on Titan
* Gurren Lagann
* Fate/Zero
* Steins;Gate
* Code Geass
* I would also cautiously recommend Naruto and One Piece, with the caveat that you gotta know what you're getting into. Their episode counts are in the several hundreds. Naruto also got a bit convoluted at the end, but it's a really good series and the first 135 episodes were some of the best anime I've ever seen. One Piece has been consistently amazing since its inception. |-| 
|-| cnv9hv3 || -12 || So they are not adding anything good but taking away DREDD??! Looks like I am suspending my account. |-| 
|-| cnva401 || 14 || The live segments were where we were introduced to Bill Nye. Otherwise,  no |-| 
|-| cnva5bt || 5 || Fun fact: this is the show where Bill Nye got his start. [There were little science segments with live action Christopher Lloyd and Nye.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzX_MhTVh2w) |-| 
|-| cnvac3v || 6 || Kyle Mooney is hilarious.  Loved him on Norm Mcdonald ' s  sports show |-| 
|-| cnvanqz || 3 || Steven Universe! Yes it does have a much more "kiddie" aesthetic, but I would argue that there is as much emotional depth in the characters as in Korra. Also there are some pretty big hints that the idyllic world they live in is actually part of a much bigger much scarier universe. |-| 
|-| cnvawvm || 3 || What? no. This is an honor reserved for people who have accomplished something not for people who actually deserve to be publicly mocked for their complete and utter douchebaggery. |-| 
|-| cnvbgfn || 5 || I remember the episode where they powered the delorian with lemons. |-| 
|-| cnvcj5w || 3 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| cnvckjt || 3 || Do people not understand how TV works?

* Producers say "Ooh let's get Justin Beiber this year!  He's polarizing, so everyone will tune in to watch that asshole and/or heartthrob get roasted! Reddit threads will be created!"
* Justin agrees, demanding huge appearance fees and final approval of all the jokes
* Half the original jokes are unapproved, comedians rewrite
* Final show airs, public goes "wow, Justin was a really good sport about this. Maybe he's a cool guy / LOL watch this asshole JB get his ass handed to him"
* Justin gets huge amount of money and publicity
* Comedians get paid less and their watered-down Justin-approved jokes make them look less talented

It's all planned before it even happens.

There was an episode where the plot centered on a really common baseball card from a sub par player. He was going to buy or steal every copy of the card,keeping one safe  and destroy the rest (I think in a washing machine, it has been a long time) therefore making his card the most valuable baseball card of all time. 

I don't know why I remember that episode, but it did inspire me to do the same with copies of Shaq Fu. Well, I say inspire, but I haven't got around to trying it yet.  |-| 
|-| cnvf0u9 || -3 || Tron: Uprising.  It was a better show than Avatar and a far better show than Korra.  Anyone that disagrees can fight me.

The care that went into the world building is just as detailed as Avatar.  The relationships are more realistic.  The evolution of the characters from simple programs to revolutionary beings is phenomenal.  The [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxgFsuMTeuM) is intense, delicate, and uplifting.  The character designs may take some getting used to, but once it clicks in your head, [everything is beautiful](https://www.flickr.com/photos/phaota2/sets/72157629871984256/).  Those are all screenshots from the show.  It's magnificent.  The fight choreography is just as creative and unique in animation as Avatar's greatest battles, something sorely lacking in Western shows.

But the Disney bought Star Wars and Marvel and had no need to make their own boy franchise anymore, so Tron is dead.  I'm still bitter about it, but at least other people can appreciate the amazing show that lived far too short a life. |-|

This scene in particular, lasted 13 minutes with no interruptions on the french version. Did they do the same thing with the English version ? |-|

|-| cnvhoig || 23 || "The Pine Barrens" is one of the funniest episodes of all-time of any show. The amazing balance between comedy and drama has not been replicated quite the same since except for Deadwood IMO. I'm sorry, my HBO fanboy is showing. |-|

|-| cnvkjth || 3 || Hey guys seriously, I know people recommend shows all the time and we all have different tastes, but DEPARTURES being added to Netflix is absolutely amazing. If you're even remotely into travel/adventure it's basically just a travel show (hipster style - before it was a massive thing) of three pretty awesome Canadian dudes going around the world. They really show off the country and culture more than what they are doing in the country. Andre (the camera man) has won awards for his cinematography, it's absolutely amazing. The show is incredible for the clearly small budget they had. Give it a try, trust me. |-|

|-| cnvonmj || 4 || Great episode. I've never heard of this show before, but I might check it out if they're all this good.

I liked how...It's hard to explain. It felt something like *No Country For Old Men* and similar films. The lack of music (for the most part), the casual violence, the silence whenever something particularly brutal happened... It was really intense without a lot of "Hollywood-izing".

In particular, I liked how the school shooter was portrayed. Usually, they seemed to be looked at sympathetically, and it never works for me ("Boo hoo, I was bullied!"). Here, I liked how he was more of a faceless personification of evil and death. |-|

Oh, and maybe change the title? |-| 
|-| cnvtgoi || 30 || Most contestents gain back all the weight afterwards unless they have gastric surgery. Many have horrible joint pain and permanant damage from punishing their 300+ pound bodies immediately.

This is not a show about safe effective weight loss. It isn't a helpful or realistic show. It is about basically giving fat people two different eating disorders (over exercising, and anorexia) at once for several months and then celebrating their unhealthy weight loss. One contestant said the worst thing for her was hearing women come up to tell her how she inspired them to try to lose 20+ pounds a week. That is dangerous and unrealistic. 

The show absolutely destroys these human beings for everyone else's enjoyment. I don't know who thinks its an uplifting show, I found it disgusting.  |-|

 Either that or the directors are seriously good  |-|

Though, the rest of the stuff like the sequestration and the limited calls home, etc, that's pretty much par for the course with these kinds of shows. |-|

|-| cnvv9gj || 11 || Nice. The gun he hands Conan is a Walther PPK, the same gun that James Bond uses. (Haven't watched much Archer, so maybe they've made a thing of it an a past episode...) |-| 
|-| cnvveht || 13 || making up a fake counter arguement to your own wants for a tv show then writing an article about why its wrong is just dumb. i have never once saw anyone who watches the show saying they WANT the show to just be a basic procedural, not once. EVERY SINGLE person who watches the show and talks about it anywhere i've ever seen has always praised the fact that it moved AWAY from being procedural and has become a great sci fi thriller.

|-| cnvvibx || 11 || We're Not even paying Rent!!!

Damn this got me interested in archer, but i would like to point out How Conan has been consistently funny and up to date with pop culture. From smash bros, to celebrities, this show is just great. |-| 
|-| cnvvizy || 5 || I've never really watched Archer (I really want to though) 
I just have to ask this though, is the voice actor for Archer the same guy who did Charlie the Unicorn? |-|

|-| cnx6jgr || 5 || I don't understand why they were laughing????? I rewatched the part multiple times and still at a loss. Please enlighten me |-| 
|-| cnx72d5 || 54 || I think it's going to be a great show. The format is excellent, with less filler than Colbert or Daily Show. I usually tuned out for the celebrity/book tour/movie promotion interviews in Colbert and Daily, anyway. They're usually a waste of time. The graphics are minimized and at the bottom of the screen, which is a welcome relief to the cable news parody model we've come to expect from this genre of show. 
Wilmore keeps it moving, keeps the panel engaging, and keeps it 100. |-| 
|-| cnx761w || 6 || What time is it at? |-| 
|-| cnx7c23 || 561 || I guess uh, for anyone not 'getting' why they're laughing, I think the dry delivery of, "and then he gets hit by a car and is in a coma." is what causes the two to laugh, especially because that sentences is the end of her description. It's a super hilarious stop, too. She just kind of looks at him afterward.

|-| cnx82fq || 42 || Wow some people really didn't get it.  |-| 
|-| cnx871p || 12 || &gt;As such, it betrays the source material’s difficult and conflicted message in the interest of the banal genre default of plucky Americans fighting for freedom against the evil invaders; 

Yeah, no. The cargo that was so important to the resistance fighters was a copy of The Grasshopper Lies Heavy. This isn't the typical fighting for freedom if fighting is what you would call that. 

&gt;Frank’s wife, Juliana Frink (Alexa Davalos), makes it clear that she opposes the racial laws that threaten her husband and that she harbors no racist feelings toward the Japanese conquerors. 

That's because initially, in the pilot, she had no major reason to feel ire towards the Japanese collectively. But her mother is plenty racist. 

I should probably read the book because if the author got this wrong about the pilot (only an hour affair), I wonder what else he got wrong on the book.  |-| 
|-| cnx87ot || 4 || Thank God somebody noticed some of the problems with this adaptation. I've been watching the universally positive coverage of the pilot (which is enormously inferior to the book) and feeling a bit like a space alien.

The absence of Childan from the show is utterly bizarre, and a very bad indication of the direction the creators/writers have in mind for this show.

The thing that worries me most about this adaptation is that they changed *The Grasshopper Lies Heavy* into an 8 minute newsreel of footage from our universe, rather than the volume of philosophy/allegory it was in the novel.

I understand what they were thinking: television is a visual medium so we should represent this work to the audience in a visual way.  But I don't think they thought it through very carefully. Because making it newsreel footage changes what it requires of the characters, and might change fundamentally how the *Man in the High Castle* works.

In the novel, the characters who choose to believe in *The Grasshopper Lies Heavy* are taking a leap of faith; believing in it requires a kind of religious sacrificing. There is an element of a beautiful mystery to it. They believe because they psychologically *must.*

In the show, having it be a simple newsreel footage makes believing in it require nothing from the characters except that they see it. It removes the mystery and the central question of the book, and removes as well the classic phildickian meta irony mindfuck of the book twisted around on itself.

It also changes the way the universe works. In the novel, it's possible that the man in the high castle is lying; it's possible that he has no window into our universe; it's possible that he invented his work about a world in which the allies won the war.

In the television show, there is no such possibility. Because we see newsreel footage we actually recognize from our own world, we *know* that the man in the high castle is a being possessed of some kind of technology or magic that allows him a window into the real universe. 

It takes away the pilgrimage of the characters, robs them of the sacrifice that faith requires, and makes this television show yet another in a long line of reductionist Philip K. Dick adaptations that chooses to excise the things that were truly special, truly interesting about his works, and replace them with B-quality sci fi potboilerisms.

I'm incredibly disappointed in the show, and disappointed in the enthusiastic reaction to it from virtually all corners. |-| 
|-| cnx89b9 || 5 || Only watched the first so far, definitely has potential but wasn't hilarious yet. Hopefully he keeps not doing the whole pitch bit for the 3rd section like daily/colbert |-| 
|-| cnx8a0t || 94 || Doesn't compare to Jimmy Fallon interviewing Bradley Cooper - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMvYTUSez_0 |-| 
|-| cnx8dd2 || 40 || I haven't enjoyed it. It lacks the wit of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report. It's a parody talk show, but I don't see how it's different from most talk shows. They need to do something to differentiate it from The View or whatever their competition is, because I don't find it entertaining. 

It'd be nice if it could replicate some of the educational value of The Daily Show/Colbert Report, because that's their best aspect: being able to educate while making someone laugh. |-| 
|-| cnx8gjr || 30 || I like the first half of the show but the panel segment is annoying to me.  There's too many little flippant one liner interruptions.  The panel seems to be more interested in one upping each other in laughs than having a real discussion. |-| 
|-| cnx8imf || -10 || I just made a post about this here yesterday - the fact is (EDIT for the goddamn grammar nazi's) MY OPINION IS the guy's voice is annoying, he's not particularly funny and worse yet, he wasn't even any good on the Daily Show. 

The idea that this somehow qualifies as a replacement for the Colbert Report is insulting.  |-| 
|-| cnx8kh2 || -5 || This is, to date, the only clip I've seen of this show and I won't be watching the show. I didn't like him on the Daily Show and he's certainly no Stephen Colbert.

Worse yet the guy's voice is shrill and annoying. Plus he did a bad Cosby impression which is laughable considering how easy that impression is.

10/10 would not watch. |-| 
|-| cnx8v3e || 16 || He needs to get his stride, but I'm hopeful. The panel stuff needs polish, but that's to be expected when you're not working on a script. He'll get better at cat-wrangling over time. I really think he has a Key &amp; Peele-like ability to walk that razor's edge between majority and minority. I mean, he criticized Al Sharpton, which feeds into the white narrative of being annoyed with him. But he did so by calling him 'Black Batman', which speaks to the minority support he engenders.  |-| 
|-| cnx8vik || 4 || It was mildly entertaining. I laughed a bit, and I think it has a lot of interesting potential, but I'm not sure yet if I will continue to watch or not. |-| 
|-| cnx8ze1 || 170 || Frankly, it looks like this is just an excuse to make more Jenna Maroney, which I am 100% fine with. |-| 
|-| cnx94eu || -3 || It wasn't that funny to be honest, but only because I've seen the Tom Cruise interview and that had me cracking.

|-| cnx96bo || 7 || Looks like my country (Morocco) is finally getting some recognition for its huge cultural heritage.  |-| 
|-| cnx9aps || 211 || Glad Netflix is making a shit ton of shows, looks like they let the creators/writers do whatever the fuck they want with their work. Will be nice to see some less formulaic tv. The weirder the better |-| 
|-| cnx9cvi || -3 || I watched this pilot cold.  I  haven't read the book and I know nothing about the story at all.

I'd be surprised if this show makes it anywhere.  I knew about it because it was partly filmed in the town where I work.

First impression: The Axis regime has outlawed indoor lighting.  In fact outdoor lighting has been muted.  Apparently ambient light is restricted in this universe.  Listen, I get it.  Dark world.  Nazis won.  Stuff bad.  But can somebody please turn on a light so we can see what's going on?

The whole news reel thing.  We live in a world with reports of fake moon landings and photoshop.  I did not make the leap that a character who is more or less integrated into the Japanese regime and an established time line would instantly recognize a movie roll of something that didn't happen as factual.  Certainly not enough for her to leave everything she knew and was connected to to follow a rabbit down the rabbit hole.

The suspense was ok.  The expected stereotypes were out in force.  The backstabbing was standard fare.  Politics were somewhat believable.  

The poignant bits.  Our main character truck breaks down and is assisted by local law enforcement.  The officer makes some statement regarding how after loosing the war he didn't even remember what they were fighting for.  Really?  Really?  If people do anything its harbor grudges.  This was a cue to me that something was seriously wrong.

And the character's reaction to the ash fall was unexpected.  In a post war Nazi based regime wouldn't this be business as usual?

Overall impression: meh.

What I think it needs: I need a reason to care.  Explaining that The Grasshopper Lies Heavy is a person/organization that can expel the invaders gives a reason to go to them.  Giving some kind of basis how TGLH matters is going to help.  Right now our characters are converging on nothing. 
 |-| 
|-| cnx9nwh || 5 || Larry Wilmore's a funny guy, so I'm willing to see it out. It has potential, and I really like the idea of the Keep it 100 segment.

But maybe it's just because Colbert &amp; John Oliver set a higher bar, but the Nightly Show feels a little too standard right now. I'm glad there's a late night show giving a platform to more minority voices, but that's honestly the only distinct thing about it so far. |-| 
|-| cnx9p74 || 20 || I like it. 

I've seen a lot of people complain that they don't just want it to become a 'race' thing. I disagree. I think that is a great way to differentiate the show. When Colbert first aired, Fox News was still promoting itself as a non-biased show while the biased nature of pundits like Bill O Rielly was a big talking point. 

Now, it seems that people get uncomfortable when anybody wants to talk about things from the perspective of race. Therefore that would be a great conversation to have and experience the news through something we don't usually see on television. 

The only issue I have with the show so far is that its not 'biting' enough. It seems to be focused more on the joke rather than making commentary about the issue. For example, with the Bill Cosby thing I thought it just ended up being a bunch of Bill Cosby jokes that we've heard everywhere else already. 

Yes, its a comedy show but the way the Daily Show, Colbert and Oliver have defined the genre, you can't just focus on the comedy. There has to be 'more'. 

I just think it will take them a bit of time to find their groove.  |-| 
|-| cnx9wog || 97 || 1. D'FWON!  Thank Christ.

2. Jane Krakowski just looks like she's playing a less-ridiculous version of Jenna Maroney.  Not sure how I feel about that.

3. Ellie Kemper's delivery made a lot of those shitty lines good.  I'm glad she's got a spotlight.

4. We must remember 30 Rock was pretty hit-or-miss when it started.  |-|

|-| cnxaaoa || -4 || she is beautiful.  and a fine actor.

that bit was horribly forced.  i'm guessing rehearsed to a certain extent.  i think her haters have been unkind in the past and i'm quickly losing faith that she is anything other than a lovely actor. |-| 
|-| cnxal4t || 5 || I saw the first episode and so far I like it better than Colbert &amp; John Oliver's show. While the panel section has its wrinkles, I like it better than the singular perspective the Daily Show offers.  |-| 
|-| cnxamzx || -5 || A good tactic to make the video go viral and advertise the movie more. |-| 
|-| cnxao1x || 46 || I was pleasantly surprised by this! The gag that got me was when Jane Krakowsie threw the water bottle into the trash. I know this show will be compared over and over to 30 rock (The setting, Jane Krakowski, Written by Tina Fey) but I really feel like it's going to be such a fresh breath of air, as well as Netflix's first real take at an original sitcom. (OITNB I consider more of a dramadey) |-| 
|-| cnxaq69 || -3 || Why is she so damn hot! I don't care what anybody says, I'll give her the D any day!  |-| 
|-| cnxau6k || -4 || The title of this post ruins the comedy of the content. We already know there is a coma in the movie, so Anne's description is not a jarring as it would have been originally. |-| 
|-| cnxaw9s || -6 || She has really, really great tits.  |-| 
|-| cnxawq2 || -4 || i'm a female and I don't like her. I can watch movies she's in and enjoy them, but as a real person when she's not acting she just rubs me the wrong way.It's the way she speaks and her facial expressions and how she comes across so arrogant and like she's above the rest of the world. Idk. She's pretty but she's not that special. I don't know lol. Can't really explain it just I don't like her.  |-| 
|-| cnxb31y || 18 || I think there is no place for any real romance in the show. Outside of the kiss between Reese and Carter (which was improvised apparently) there also hasn't been any. None of the characters can afford to be in a relationship because of the danger they are constantly in.

Their use of linux and command line always makes me light up inside. |-| 
|-| cnxbb8r || 34 || Watching the office I never thought Ellie Kemper would be able to carry her own show, I hope this show proves me wrong, but I am not convinced by this trailer. |-| 
|-| cnxbcum || 11 || Really want to like this show, but for me its just not that funny. I understand there is not much content to digest, but I trust my gut and cant see this being anywhere near as successful as John Oliver, Jon Stewart, or Colbert.

 Since I was such a huge fan of Colbert and Larry literally took over Colbert's building, studio, offices and time slot, its hard for me not to compare the two. My apt is around the corner from the studio and I think it would be fun to see it live, maybe its funnier in person?? 

 |-| 
|-| cnxbie3 || 10 || Well, to be fair, Reese is played up to be a pretty handsome guy (which, let's face it, Caviezel is) throughout the series. However, due to Reese's nature, it wouldn't make too much sense to have him have relationships on the "outside", not that he would even have time for that. You can say the same about the rest of the main cast.

The cool thing about Person of Interest is that the so-called "scifi" elements are very close to being reality. Are they possibly exaggerated? Yes, like Finch mapping out an entire building in a matter of seconds using its wifi with only a laptop; but it's certainly possible given enough time and resources to do such a thing. I'm actually an electrical engineer, and I usually end up scoffing at most of the mumbo jumbo pseudo-science they try to jam into series, yet PoI is remarkably on point with most of its science even if it does cut corners at times. |-| 
|-| cnxbknv || 10 || The best word I can find to describe Anne Hathaway is pleasant.  |-| 
|-| cnxbm6x || 4 || I am not hooked on it yet - but I'm seeing potential.  My main complaint is the panel stuff - I watched the first episode and felt confused on its direction.  The panel was part un-funny comedy (though grain of salt, I am not a Bill Burr fan), part seriousness, and therefore ended up being neither...just an un-funny pithy blend of both.  I personally think the panel could be a successful regular feature if it picked a direction and went with it, but I'd be even happier if it wasn't featured on every single episode. |-| 
|-| cnxbwhf || 3 || I like it so far. The panel might take a while to polish but it's about time there was a show about minorities. |-| 
|-| cnxbzzo || 4 || I would just like to say that Johnny Flynn is an amazing musician, and his voice alone my make this film a must see. |-| 
|-| cnxc2n2 || 7 || It's got some workshopping and tweaking to do, but the potential is huge. I've enjoyed the first two episodes (I watch on Hulu the following day) and while it seems a little rough, there's a lot to like.

Wilmore is a great host. He's not only a great host for a show that we as a society need to have available, he's also just a good host period. And he'll continually get better at this job. He is far less abrasive than Bill Maher (a show in which I do not like due to Maher being a complete dick), but is still willing to jump in and voice his opinion.

The Nightly Show is more of a companion to The Daily Show than The Colbert Report ever was due to its format and lack of a "created character," and I think over time it will improve and really be something valuable to late-night television. To all the critics; give it time to grow, evolve, and take shape. |-| 
|-| cnxc5fi || 19 || I like Anne Hathaway but there come in point in that video where the laugh becomes really fake. I feel like she starts acting laughing halfway through |-| 
|-| cnxcb71 || 5 || It reminds me a lot of Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn.  The panel idea is a good and bad one.  I like it better then a single guest but its hard to follow when everyone talks over each other.  Although it would be a bit of a copycat, I'd like to see him add some man on the street stuff too. |-| 
|-| cnxclq3 || -5 || They're laughing at the fact that both are making millions and millions of dollars, Hathaway for playing make believe and Stewart for chatting with her about it on TV.

Meanwhile, some people are spending lifetimes as cashiers for Walmart, preparing to die without even coming close to living a comfortable life.

Naw, just kidding, I'm not a Debbie-downer, these two are awesome!  |-| 
|-| cnxcots || 4 || I love Kemp-dog and FeyFey, and this looks like it'll have solid jokes (which is really all I need), but is anyone else kind of concerned with the premise? How many episodes until we go, "we get it, you were in a cult" or the opposite "you've been out of the cult so long, why don't you know what Pizza is?"
 |-| 
|-| cnxcs7w || 3 || Is the book good? I mean did it age nicely? This seems like a book I would like.

Also, from the world map I've seen in Wikipedia, Canada seems to be like the only free country in this world. Why is that? Does the book tell or is it just a simple fact?
 |-| 
|-| cnxcxg9 || 5 || Personally, I'm really enjoying The Nightly Show. The group discussion helps bring multiple sides to each topic, as well as differentiate itself from Stewart and Oliver. Maybe the racial discussions aren't applicable to an audience looking for a new Colbert, but it makes me happy to see Larry strive to keep it 100. |-| 
|-| cnxd6hl || -5 || Looks weird. Don't see how this premise can last more than a season, but I'm excited to try it out :) |-| 
|-| cnxd8ho || 4 || Highly recommended, particularly for anybody who enjoys slower, more meditative shows (e.g., Mad Men or Rectify). I think it's got some really profound things to say about our relationships with our parents as we grow up, but I understand people being bored. |-| 
|-| cnxde00 || 3 || All I want for POI is more AI backstory and less gun shoot outs. I can find gun shoot outs on any cop show, But I want person of interest to be more about AI mythology. |-|

|-| cnxf6td || 3 || I think I would have liked it if I hadn't read the book. In converting a five hundred page novel into three hours they've understandably cut loads but this turned me off. Cromwell's childhood which I found one of the most interesting parts of the novel should've been the opening but was relegated to a couple of flashbacks. The characterisation may also be better than the average TV show but when you've had all the context and development of the book, this felt very thin and almost like a series of snapshots rather than the more developed world and narrative of the novel. |-| 
|-| cnxf7xl || 10 || I have a huge girl-crush on Anne Hathaway. I wouldn't mind rubbing breasts with her. nolesbo |-| 
|-| cnxf8di || 3 || As a liberal, progressive American, this show is beginning to worry me. I'd imagine that there's nuance to the idea that "I just voted for him because he's black," but in the name of humor, that nuance is cut short. Because Larry realizes that he's satirizing himself to a degree, we end with the soundbite that every conservative has been hoping to hear since 2008: that black people do not understand how to choose a leader based on merit; they will (and did) vote for Obama because of his race, and nothing more. Without adding more to the discussion, Larry does a disservice to those Americans (black, white, and every color under the sun) who stood up and said, "It's important to me that Obama is black. But it is not the whole story."

Much of the humor in the first few episodes has had a similarly outdated or lacking view of race in America. Larry's response to "The last racist thought you had," was wondering if the white lady on the street thought he was going to steal her purse. Really, Larry? A well-dressed black man in lower Manhattan truly has that to fear on a moment-by-moment basis? I'm reminded of a scene in Chris Rock's new movie where he claims a black man can't get a cab in New York (referencing his role in Down to Earth). He stick his hand out, and one stops on a dime. Times change. People change. Culture changes. Racism isn't gone by a long stretch, but much of the commentary in this show need to catch up to the times. |-|

|-| cnxhaek || 3 || The Wire's finale was a prefect representation of the series as a whole.  |-| 
|-| cnxhe82 || 13 || As far as comedies go- 30 Rock.  And I include Seinfeld and Friends in that.

1) Wrapped up satisfying/hilarious conclusions for all of its characters, even the minor ones like Lutz and Pete.

2) Tied up ongoing gags like Mickey Rourke and Kenneth being immortal. 

3) Made references to almost every season, guest stars included (I loved Nancy losing her accent and the Rural Juror finale).

4) Dealt with moving on and leaving things behind with wit and honesty.  The scene with Tina and Tracey where she tells him that they will probably lose touch, but that she loves him, was so well-done.  And in a strip club.

AND MOST IMPORTANTLY:

5) Had a rational plot that kept things moving instead of a "lets look back" episode |-|

|-| cnxk0p7 || 6 || I was at this recording with a friend! The audience was falling out of their seats when this happened. I &lt;3  Stewart and Hathaway |-| 
|-| cnxkiqy || 16 || It looks funnier than I thought it would be, and certainly unique. I think I'm worried that the characters are too quirky, especially the "handsome gay black man who can afford a shitty NYC apartment on a street performer's salary and house a girl without a job" thing. It feels like the characters will be unrelatable in any way, and thus alienate the audience.

Ellie Kemper is my favorite though, so I'll give it a shot. |-|

|-| cnxlhu8 || 23 || Good grief.. she was so bland on Glee. Yawn-worthy. Let's hope that was due to the terrible writing.

I was REALLY hoping for Claire Holt instead, love her. |-| 
|-| cnxlq4m || 13 || Outside of Reddit, nobody I know is watching Constantine, which I'm surprised because it's DC and Procedural. |-| 
|-| cnxlrnb || 7 || The Sopranos. It's a contentious ending, but I personally loved it. It was unpredictable; it was bold and challenging; and despite what some might say, I'd argue that it was completely in line with the entire series - which was often provocative in the way it relished in its ambiguity and difficult questions - that preceded it. 

And it's still hotly debated going on eight years later, just one more testament to how powerful a single few minutes of film can be. I couldn't even begin to calculate how many words have been written with the sole purpose of analyzing and trying to unlock the meaning of that final scene. Fact is, while a lot of people were upset with what they perceived as a lack of closure (or any conclusion at all), anything less than what we got wouldn't have remained nearly as memorable or talked about so many years later.

The entire last season that came before it was equally good. Show really went out on a high note. |-| 
|-| cnxlvfu || 7 || For me, it would have to be The Good Wife. It's a tremendous series, my favorite on television for the past two years, and I understand why more people don't watch it (the premise, name, it's a network show), even though it pretty much crushes all expectations. But the internet has a knack for taking those little talked about shows and blowing them up, so I'm surprised it's not more popular considering its quality.

Also, yes, FNL. It's one of my favorite. It's definitely one of those gems you don't understand until you watch it.  |-| 
|-| cnxlvyv || 45 || I hope they use mexican cuisine for this season's episode naming. Chimichanga, Tacos, Enchiladas, etc. |-| 
|-| cnxlwjq || 11 || For me, it's Hannibal. Yeah I've been seeing it a bit more on /r/television lately, but I've heard almost nobody talk about it in the real world the way they do about House of Cards or GoT.

From memory, Hannibal in the past few weeks was rated the #1 show of 2014 by tvguide.com, vulture.com, avclub.com, and I think ign.com, and won Best Returning Show of 2014 and Best Sci-fi/Horror/Fantasy Show of 2014 on rottentomatoes.com.

Like, I can't grasp how it's this well-received critically yet nobody talks about it. I'm thrilled it's coming back for a third season, and I hope it continues for as long as it needs to. |-|

|-| cnxmgl8 || 5 || Spartacus. Stayed true to itself. Had a big final battle. Every character and loose thread was resolved. Upped the budget for the finale. Even had a shout out to the first star. Very satisfying.   |-| 
|-| cnxmjl2 || 3 || I wish that Hannibal was released like a Netflix series. 

I watched S1 and S2 back-to-back over a week or so, and I don't think I could cope with waiting a week between episodes. Nor could I resist the urge and wait until the series ends to watch them all. Especially with it now being shown in the summer. |-| 
|-| cnxmq46 || 8 || You don't really hear about Bates Motel on here. Mainly because not a lot of people go to A&amp;E for scripted TV anymore. Vera Farmiga is wonderful on it.  |-| 
|-| cnxmwpx || 3 || I would watch this.   Loved this show back in the 90s |-| 
|-| cnxn13w || 31 || Episodes. A joint British/American comedy drama starring Matt LeBlanc. It's got very positive reviews and is in its 4th season but I've rarely seen it referenced by anyone, on reddit or otherwise.

Also, there are many shows that are quite popular on reddit but almost unheard of elsewhere. |-| 
|-| cnxn35a || 27 || The Knick.  It was my absolute favorite new TV series this past year.  It's some of the best directed television I've ever seen.  It has an Academy Award winning director in Steven Soderbergh that shot, cut, and edited the entire 10 hours in the same way he would do a feature film.  It's very similar to True Detective in that respect and I think it's right around the same quality.  And the soundtrack is just phenomenal.  

I would assume that some of the reasons it's not more popular is that it's on Cinemax (people assume it's going to be the same quality as their softcore porn films) and that it's a period piece set in 1900 NYC.

But the acting is phenomenal with Clive Owen (nominated for a Golden Globe) and Andre Holland killing it and all the supporting actors doing great jobs as well.  Their characters are just as rich and interesting and not just sterotyped throwaways to fill in around the main actors.  And for me at least the story is very interesting.  You're basically watching modern medicine come into being.  You're watching the very first humans that got to live in the beginnings of what we would call a modern lifestyle.

|-| cnxn98v || 9 || I like the idea of next gening some of my favorite series from the 80s and 90s and quantum leap is a perfect candidate. In the last episode it mentioned that Sam never returned home. In the new show this would mean that he is lost in time with no contact from Al or anyone from the present. Have the series focus on Sam's daughter who was conceived during the episode when Sam switched places in the machine with Al. She grows up always wanting her father and she continues his research in order to find him and bring him back. She steps in to the quantum leap accelerator and suffers the same fate as her father, but it is free of the limitation on leaping within her lifetime as she improved her father's design because she thought he was possibly lost in an earlier time. Now she is solving issues in the past while looking for evidence of her father. In a perfect world this would allow her to have some Back to the Future 2 moments when she is in the same time as her father. |-|

|-| cnxne7y || 19 || *Person of Interest* should be talked about so much more. Most people dismiss it as a typical CBS procedural when it really is not. It started that way, but after a while, it has become a serialized dystopian science fiction show that explores the ramifications of AI surveillance systems. More people need to watch this show. |-|

|-| cnxnyg9 || 4 || This British show Ideal from a few years back. Was such a good, surrealist stoner comedy with bits of pulp and absurdity. I am honestly surprised it hasn't been grabbed by Netflix or Hulu and become a cult fave in America. |-| 
|-| cnxo5cs || 4 || I think the trailer makes the show not look so great, but underneath it seems like Erin from the Office moves to 30 Rock's version of New York (which sounds great to me). The music and editing of the trailer makes it seem like just another primetime sitcom.  |-| 
|-| cnxo6k0 || 4 || I bought the first few season on DVD 2(?) years ago to share with my then 11-12 year old son.  We watched the first three episodes and I was surprised at how the show had not held up to the test of time at all.  My son,"You really thought this show was good"?  I told him when I was in high school I loved the show.   |-| 
|-| cnxo6nr || 12 || Avatar: The Last Airbender had a pretty stellar ending. I still enjoy its ending a little more than The Legend of Korra. I felt because the whole of Avatar was building up to the final fight with the Fire Lord that it felt more climatic. Not to say Korra was any slouch either. It had a great ending as well. |-|

nope, its perhaps even more gorgeous than the one in s1 + s2, wow, this show continues to top itself in every way.  |-| 
|-| cnxpxii || 5 || Love this show but Hannibal's fighting ability and lighter than air stealth abilities are a bit much for show based in reality. Only thing that really hurts the show in my opinion.  |-|

I just fell in love with Ellie Kemper while binge watching the office this month. Now she's got a new show? Lucky me :D |-| 
|-| cnxrr5y || 12 || Venture Bros. There's pretty much nothing else like it and it just had a special come out this week and other than places dedicated to cartoons it seems like hardly anyone knows it exists.

Also Moral Orel. It ended in 2008 but I think it's probably the best thing to come out of Adult Swim right next to Venture Bros. It starts off as a satire of hypocritical churchgoers and becomes one of the best dramas I've ever seen. I'd say nearly as good as Mad Men or The Wire. |-| 
|-| cnxrsmg || -9 || I thought Supergirl was a hot teen blonde with sharp features, high cheekbones, long legs and (B-C) tits? Am I wrong here?  To me she always looked like a hot cheerleader. So based on this shouldn't they  cast some sort of Czech, Rusian, Polish or Eastern European model/actress or maybe a girl that looks like the Victoria's Secret models or some cheerleader?

Melissa's face is too round imho not angular or sharp enough which is something that many women of eastern European or European decent in general have. Plus most of these wome nare natural blondes with long legs and bombshell bodies. 

I mean from everything I ever saw whether it was the DC animated series, or movies like the last Superman unbound to what I saw from the comics she is supposed to look like every high school virgin's wet dream. 

it wasn't just about super strength but super physique, and bombshell looks (nice body)....I mean for pete's sake she flies around in a skimpy blue and red cheerleader outfit that barely covers her panties.  |-| 
|-| cnxsgpn || 3 || So she's like a Superman that can't dunk? Got it. |-| 
|-| cnxss1r || 10 || I liked how "Little Brown Jug" and "How Dry I Am" were included in the music. |-| 
|-| cnxt576 || 5 || Jane the Virgin. Until award season, very little was known or said about it. I love it and my friends still don't know what that show is even about. Even though the premise is wacky, I still love it and usually I'm not the kind of person who watches a telenovela comedy. Plus, it's on the CW so there's that. |-| 
|-| cnxtk0t || 10 || Broadchurch. It's a BBC show and the first season is streaming on Netflix. I originally started watching it because of David Tennant but the entire large cast is excellent. The cinematography is beautiful and the seaside cliff-strewn England town is a fresh setting. It's one of those binge-watching "just one more episode before bed" shows.  |-| 
|-| cnxul92 || 5 || I wish that they would do the panels like The Daily Show does extended interviews (keep recording and put it online). There is substantive discussion that is lost due to time limitations. For instance, on Jan 21st episode, I want to know why the female writer/ reporter woman wouldn't stand up for Obama's remarks on equal pay for women. I understand that it's a comedy show and they have to interject substantive discussion with jokes, but that doesn't mean it cannot be a platform for rational discourse.   |-| 
|-| cnxuw39 || 11 || How could anyone be embarrassed about New Girl.

Fucking funny as shit.

&gt;These are two shows that have "girl" in their title, and I feel like a lot of males would be embarrassed to say they enjoy these shows.

This statement confuses the fuck out of me. |-| 
|-| cnxux27 || 4 || It doesn't seem either funny or interesting. They have a little discussion but they don't really get to have a big debate. |-|

|-| cnxvogf || 7 || Lost. I seem to get judged by everyone. |-| 
|-| cnxvr16 || 10 || 10 minutes in and the pilot somewhat captures the spirit of the pilot of House MD, which I'm sure is what they're shooting for. The whole "I'm a..." Backstrom does needs to be cut out, because I'm already sick of it.  

So far it's more interesting than "Rake" - which was last year's attempt at a successor to House, but I'm hoping that Backstrom can find itself if only because I LOVE Dennis Haysbert (aka President Palmer/AllState Man). |-| 
|-| cnxw172 || 7 || 30 year old dude here. Watched Gilmore Girls twice now and quote it all the time. That show's fantastic.

The shows I watch that would probably fall into the guilty pleasure category are Girl Meets World and Switched at Birth. Maybe Revenge and the Shonda Rhymes shows to an extent as well.  |-|

|-| cnxwrpv || 4 || OK, but it feels forced.  Similar to House, IMO.   

I like Rainn Wilson, but Hugh Laurie is a fantastic actor.  Hard to live up to it.   |-| 
|-| cnxwtmw || 8 || **JUSTIFIED.**

Season one starts out pretty episodic, so I see why people have a hard time getting into it (I did). But at the end of S1, it turns around and makes you think, huh, I can get into this. S2 is amazing, and it stays pretty great (I won't spoil anything). It can definitely be a "slow burn" show, but it is SO CONSISTENTLY GOOD. It doesn't take itself too seriously and has a lot of humor. Walton Goggins (of The Shield fame, another superb show) is an amazing actor (his first appearance on E1 isn't all that's to him), and Timothy Olyphant has great chemistry with him.

It just started its final season. Watch it, y'all.  |-|

Perfectly written - clever, smart. It would have been easy to fall back on the infallible machine and make it and "easy" episode, but instead they took an hour to show the vulnerability of every character. No other show I have watched recently would be brave enough to do what the PoI writer's did in that episode. |-|

|-| cnxz5rn || 3 || Supernatural. I love it's sense of humor and over time I've grown to enjoy the characters, and maybe even the plot, but god damn is it a dumb show. Every week they fight a monster that can only be killed by an ancient bone dagger enchanted by Merlin, and dipped in unicorns blood, but punching them in the face generally works pretty well too, shooting or stabbing them may do nothing, but a punch to the face works every time. Then there's the throw away ghost episodes. It's like they have a machine that generates ghost episodes by randomizing 3 or 4 variable with 2 or 3 options each, and spits out a script. |-| 
|-| cnxze2s || 8 || My current favorite new show that I've found on Netflix is Peaky Blinders. Don't know many other people who have seen it, but it's an early 20th century British crime drama that is beautiful both in composition and story, offered in devastatingly short six episode seasons. |-|

|-| cny0bvh || 9 || My favorite has to be the cold open to Game of Thrones season 1. 

Season 3 and season 4 had pretty damn good cold opens as well, the melting down of Ice in the season 4 cold open was sad to watch. |-| 
|-| cny0d9k || -17 || Fuck! No!  I was so happy Will was dead!  He was the worst thing in the show, always so effected and fake. I loved when then killed him, clean slate! New characters, Hannibal and new story. This is a bad idea :( So sad to see him alive :( |-| 
|-| cny0dzd || 12 || Person of Interest's "The Devil's Share" was a fantastic one last year.

And Fringe and Breaking Bad also had some great ones. |-| 
|-| cny0lsj || 5 || after the [red](http://img2.timeinc.net/ew/i/2013/04/04/SHINING-HANNIBAL.jpg) bathroom, and the [green](http://i.imgur.com/6MuGUKm.jpg) bathroom, I really want [this](http://i.imgur.com/sHo5dmJ.jpg) to be another shining reference. Though if it is, its not as overt, but we dont know if his desk is facing stairs or not.  |-|

oh for fuck's sake... 

EDIT: 4 hours later I realize this original reactionary post adds nothing to the discussion, but I honestly had to close the window after reading that line.

I thought I'd edit my way back to some reddiquette

I half feel like the article writer is trying to be subversive, or maybe even flippant... but, at worst, possibly even unintentionally undermining the project ever so slightly by writing that on such a high profile magazine.

This can't be anywhere in the actual network pitch/log/press release... It just.. can't. I cannot fathom a marketing team being that out of touch with how people view something like that, especially in the recent zeitgeist reaching levels of empowerment bloggerisms.

It makes me angry slightly. Less because of the old static character image lock it tries to draw, but because this is the kind of bullshit fuckery we allow entertainment writers to thrive on these days without seeing a damn frame from the show. Op-ed sarcasm under the radar.

However... If it's actually in the press statements... I am definitely not watching on principle of not trying to time travel back to the 90's... or either of the surrounding decades I guess would work too. |-| 
|-| cny1ezw || 23 || "Reynolds vs. Reynolds: The Cereal Defense." |-| 
|-| cny1fj7 || 12 || I saw this episode on TV when I was a kid. It ends with them getting into a car crash, but then it pulls back and shows that they're in a studio, and were just acting the entire time. In the closing scene, they're walking out of the studio together talking about how they hope they made their point about the dangers of drinking alcohol. |-| 
|-| cny1ifw || 10 || All the airplane crash cold opens in Breaking Bad. |-| 
|-| cny1jo9 || 5 || Penny Dreadful, a mix of all Gothic Victorian most famous characters and it works marvelously. And Eva Green superb acting. |-| 
|-| cny1yo0 || 4 || Halt and Catch Fire... It's really damn nerdy, but it does have some great moments. |-| 
|-| cny233n || 21 || Those 3 were fucking lightweights, though. |-| 
|-| cny28tn || 20 || "You're goddamn right" from Breaking Bad. I dunno, maybe that's an easy pick but I don't think I've ever been that hyped from a cold opening before. I literally jumped out of my seat. |-|

|-| cny2ntk || 14 || Happy Endings had a tone of great cold opens but [the Mary Tyler Moore joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hFC6bDhrPg) gets me every time. 

We lost that show too soon.

|-| cny2per || 5 || [Breaking Bad pilot. [1:53]](http://www.amctv.com/breaking-bad/videos/breaking-bad-opening-pt-1) |-| 
|-| cny2z98 || 9 || The episode of "it's always sunny in Philadelphia" where frank runs into the bar, trips and gets an awful bloody nose. The rest of the episodes funnyness is multiplied by 10x because he just has an awful bloody face.

I think it's called "Frank's beauties" |-| 
|-| cny31yk || 5 || I loved the opening in the 5th season of the Office where Dwight is running the fire drill. The way it escalates is just hilarious. |-| 
|-| cny3dhe || -4 || I get no kick from champagne.
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all |-| 
|-| cny3hov || 3 || Banned because it was so embarrassingly bad I assume |-| 
|-| cny3i08 || 12 || The pilot of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. It's a little long, but totally worth it.  |-| 
|-| cny3jia || 19 || The walking dead season 3 episode 1. The group clears a house and scavenges for food but no dialog is said. Shows how efficient they have become at surviving.  |-| 
|-| cny3l6s || 4 || SNL. All of the Ferrel/Hammond Bush-Gore debates. The "Stratergy" skit is especially memorable.  |-| 
|-| cny3v5p || 3 || I feel like this was an episode the network made them create. There's kind of that throwaway line early on from Buster where he mentions that this is an episode to show the evils of alcohol. Plus it sucks. And I don't know how many of you remember, but in the late '80s and early '90s there was this huge anti-drug and alcohol messaging going on where every show had to do it's "Drugs and alcohol will ruin your life." I remember growing up terrified of doing drugs, even pot, because there were always those commercials that made pot seem like meth. But when I was 16 and all of my friends were smoking pot and they were all fine, I tried it for the first time and realized that adults were either entirely full of shit or were just really stupid. I feel like smoking pot for the first time and coming out fine made me really start second-guessing everything old people claim as the truth, which is why it's important to talk to your kids like they're real people.

TL;DR: it's late and I'm tired and procrastinating on a paper and so I'm just rambling away. |-|

|-| cny72ih || 3 || First 5 minutes of [Black Mirror's first episode](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uVIVoDEgfhs&amp;amp;autoplay=1) has a grounded reality in which the English PM is faced with the ethical dilemma of allowing a girl to die OR he must go on national TV and, um...

Just watch the first 5 minutes.

I think you'll be hooked. Only 6 episodes sadly - 7 now if you include Jon Hamm's new thing - but a must for all lovers of the Twilight Zone / Outer Limits / ethically dubious, mostly near-future sci-fi. |-|

|-| co8vwfl || 209 || Netflix doesn't have much choice but to invest in new content - essentially becoming a studio with some contracts farmed out.  

The existing players are going to do as much as they can to keep Netflix from getting license to anything, so the more they make themselves, the better.

The transition period from "we depend on other people's stuff" through "we have enough of our own to survive" to "we're so great people really want to have us carry their content along side our own" is going to be rough to manage, though.

I agree with the rating downgrade, but I think the potential reward is actually going up more than the risk. |-| 
|-| co9cqz2 || 40 || A real honest try at a new Stargate franchise (looking at you, SyFy and SGU) would be a great way for Netflix to beat HBO and Amazon to the Scifi genre if they did it right. There's really no popular sci-fi shows out right now, and Interstellar being such a hit and Star Wars coming out again soon, that could be a burgeoning market. |-| 
|-| co9nbga || 12 || I just want Better of Ted back for business.  |-| 
|-| co902wi || 88 || Please get the Avatar and Korra universe. Please please please. |-| 
|-| co904o7 || 14 || Expanding to China? Interesting. The thing about China is it's one of the piracy capitals of the world. They already have free versions of Netflix- some of them being Baidu video and Tudou. I'll be interested to see what they're planning. |-| 
|-| co9dk89 || 7 || I think Lucille Austero is going for a power grab |-| 
|-| co9ip01 || 17 || C'mon new Star Trek series....I can dream right? |-| 
|-| co94t45 || 12 || Honestly Netflix has enough programing that this doesn't seem like a huge deal anymore. In a way this is like the "clincher" to me, proof that they've made it. 5 years ago when they had no original programming and all of their content deals were based on subscriber numbers they were in a lot more trouble. Their own growth cause their content deals to be able to be voided and renegotiated. They ended up splitting the services and that was massively successful for them.

This is a much smaller problem now. They're not trying to get into the market anymore, they're trying to dominate it. Season 3 of HoC/Orange will get huge publicity as the headliners and now with shows like Peaky Blinders and Bojack they have niche shows with strong followings in all kinds of genres.

There's also no alternative for parents with young kids that comes even close to netflix. |-| 
|-| co8x4ad || 35 || I hope they do well. Marco Polo seems to be a waste of 100 million. Not a one of my friends watches it. Anecdotal, yes. But It seems to be a flop to me. Does Netflix ever release their viewership numbers? Maybe it's a big hit outside the U.S. |-|

|-| co8xp7r || 30 || For anyone who doesn't want to watch the video.

* **Dick Grayson** - While Dick will still be Robin this is set after his fallout with Bruce. He's left Gotham and moved to Boston where he's a Private Detective. We can look forward to him likely becoming Nightwing in the series.
* **Barbara Gordon** - Babs will be wheelchair bound already and serve the Titans pretty much as Oracle.
* **Hawk and Dove** - It'll be the Hank Hill and Dawn Granger versions of the characters. They'll have a romantic relationship but expect them to be different from their comic book counterparts.
* **Raven** - Raven.
* **Starfire** - Everyone's favorite Tamaranean shows up at the end of the current version of the script to join the Titans. We should probably expect a love triangle between Dick, Babs, and Starfire because that's how drama works.

Nothing is set in stone though and stuff is subject to change since it's still an early version of the script. TNT and the CW are both owned by Warner Bros. so it's possible that Arrow and The Flash could cross over with it.

Hawk and Dove are an interesting choice but I'd much rather have had Beast Boy and Wally West. I understand not using Cyborg (since WB/DC is pushing him as a Justice Leaguer instead of a Titan now) so Oracle is a nice substitute and a great character in general, but I'd really like to see Cyborg in the show at some point. |-| 
|-| co8yrt9 || 28 || I understand cyborg not being in but im kinda sad that beast boy didn't make the cut. |-| 
|-| co97v3j || 6 || How about having Manu Bennett's Slade as a villain at some point? Slade was a good villain in the animated version and more Manu is always good.  |-| 
|-| co8zgww || 6 || It is an interesting choice with having Hawk and Dove but it will be awesome to see how this turns out.

I wonder if we will get to see live action versions of Jason,Tim and Steph with Dick becoming Nightwing and Babs as Oracle. |-| 
|-| co93wms || 3 || Hawk and dove! Awesome can't wait.  |-| 
|-| co9677l || 3 || Awesome! I love this whole TV DC universe that seems to be building up! |-| 
|-| co9httv || 14 || If they keep adding in villains now the villains will all be 60 before Batman is Batmanning. |-| 
|-| co9eofc || 14 || Am I the only one who would prefer not to know the back story? I feel that unless they do it really well, a Joker back story will ruin him to a degree...  |-| 
|-| co9ddvh || 15 || How is this show rating? I'm just curious because it lost my interest very quickly, and I'm generally really interested in anything Batman related. |-| 
|-| co9hkzw || 5 || So the start of the Red Hood Gang? |-| 
|-| co9eiwz || 15 || Joker stuff already? Seems like you would want to save that for later seasons? They already have like 10 villains already no?  |-| 
|-| co9fykw || 9 || joker can not be joker without batman. this show does not and will probably never have batman without recasting and large time jumps between seasons.

they should just stay away from it, either that or realize the show isnt as good as they hoped it would be(lets be real, unless a scene involves penguin it really isnt that good,and if a scene involves fish mooney you can rest assured it will suck dick.) and change their mind about introducing batman |-| 
|-| co9he90 || 4 || This show worked better on paper than real life unfortunately.  |-| 
|-| co9juyr || 3 || Ehh, I've been enjoying the show pretty well so far, but think they shouldn't ever pull in the Joker.

I would like to see some recurring villain linked to Arkham / madness, but they can pick a less prominent existing character or invent a new one for that kind of role.

Have really liked Taylor's performance in the show.  Was skeptical at first based entirely on appearance (Penguin as a slim guy?) but he's been great to watch. |-| 
|-| co96nf3 || 4 || Pretty cool.  Not surprising though as all the ingredients were present:

* it's the SB (by itself that guarantees massive viewing---commercials, HT show, the spectacle of it all, etc).

* great storyline of NE and Brady/Belichick looking for #4 and in discussion as "best ever" vs defending champs.

* explosive offense vs incredible defense.

* tight-lipped, "old school" coach vs open and engaging "new school" coach.

* dropback, conventional passing, prototypically-sized QB vs duelthreat, "new style", undersized QB.

* "deflategate" and Marshawn Lynch media-snub stories.

* west coast vs east coast.

* and probably most important, it was a good game.  The outcome was decided until there were 21 seconds left.  Last year (SEA vs DEN) it was over quickly.  This year the action built to an amazing climax---I think that probably drew in some people who might not have watched, but they heard about it being close/coming down to the wire/etc.  |-|

Ben and Leslie on Parks and Recreation is also a nice pairing, as was Turk and Carla on Scrubs for its willingness to explore more of the potential tribulations of relationships than most comedies.  Finally, I always liked the Jeff and Britta pairing on Community, even if it was basically dead after the first season or so. |-|

|-| co91ozc || 5 || I find the villains in most Marvel movies to be quite generic and unmemorable aside from Loki, so hopefully a Netflix format will change things. |-| 
|-| co93lcw || 7 || Fantastic show so far!

If you want to watch the first episode, Pivot's uploaded it to YouTube, so you can check it out for free.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxX9dPKir9E |-| 
|-| co91jjk || 4 || I really enjoyed the first episode (technically the first two). It does have an unsettling feeling behind it, like the walls are collapsing around the people the show centers on. As time went on I was getting the impression that maybe Stanley Tucci's role was smaller than we were led to believe, but he came in at the right time and the show feels like it's ready to take off now. The performances are pretty good too, with Tucci being great as usual, and Richard Dormer's sheriff role is pretty damn good. I think he might be the standout of the season if things keep at this level of goodness. Plus Michael Gambon, can't go wrong if he's involved. |-| 
|-| co96bcm || 4 || Very promising show, I look forward to seeing where it goes. The atmosphere of vaguely defined menace is great, especially when coupled with the sheer bleakness of the landscape. I did feel that the first episode had a lot of "This guy has a dark secret, this guy is out of his depth, this guy has a big life problem, these two have a troubled relationship..." groundwork stuff, but it'll be great to see it all pay off.

Barring one or two plot points being over-emphasised, the show treats its audience like adults, which is always a good thing. Acting is stellar all round, especially from Richard Dormer and (predictably) Michael Gambon. Some of the camerawork is a bit weird (particularly the establishing shots of the landscape) but on the whole it's very well-directed.

A very minor point, but I think it would have been kind of cool if they didn't provide subtitles for the bit where Dormer spoke Norwegian; it would have put the viewer in Stanley Tucci's shoes, adding to the sense of paranoia, distrust, and isolation. Besides, the translation was hardly necessary. |-|

|-| coaw6o5 || 448 || I can't wait to see this, it looks grittier for Marvel which is refreshing. Shows depicted in Hell's Kitchen should be darker. |-| 
|-| cob0ntk || 124 || They got Vincent D'Onofrio to play Kingpin. Man, this series is gonna be straight fire. |-| 
|-| coaxb8l || 57 || Deborah Ann Woll from True Blood is in it. I'm there. |-| 
|-| coawcc8 || 182 || Reading the breakdown below the video is key, because I really expected to see the red costume.  Apparently, the showrunners are very much treating this as "act one", before he gets his shit together and really forms an identity for himself.  It's going to be interesting to see how well the Marvel Universe does in this long-format, as opposed to having to get origin, plot, villain, conflict, and resolution crammed into 90-150 minutes. |-| 
|-| coavrcj || 71 || April?  Damnit, I thought it was Feb/March. |-| 
|-| coayav9 || 47 || I'm really curious as how powerful they will make him. Over the years he's been portrayed as basically a semi-high powered ninja, to being able to hold his own against Captain America. Also, they didn't show anything of his radar sense. This is something the movie at least tried. And what will they show of his billy club/grappling device? I'm getting a real grounded vibe from this trailer.

Overall, I'm just very curious as to how they will make a lot of things in this show. I'm sure it'll be good and I'll probably watch it all in a day. But still, Daredevil is an interesting character as he's one of the more street level, B-list Marvel characters out there. But also, I wonder if they'll broach on him being ...uh, kind of a ladies man. In the comics, he always has a hot girl after him. But it never ends well.

 |-| 
|-| coawfgd || 79 || I am really enjoying all these superhero shows. Some people might feel that there are too many, but I've enjoy all of them to some degree. Hope this turns out well. Agents of Shield took a bit to get its footing, but Agent Carter was great from the start. Hope Daredevil starts out strong here too. |-| 
|-| coawu1w || 21 || I know this is probably a dumb question but this, and the other Marvel Netflix series will all take place in the same universe at the movies and Agents of Shield right? |-|

|-| coaw8bd || 74 || Next step : 

Netflix presents :
Joe Manganiello in... THE PUNISHER |-| 
|-| cob16e9 || 12 || THIS is the Daredevil I wanted to see over a decade ago.  This trailer reminds me (or maybe it's wishful thinking) of the Bendis/Maleev Daredevil of the early-mid 2000's.  Gritty, violent, dark.  I'm pretty hopeful for this series. |-| 
|-| coaz5g6 || 11 || That looks like a complete trailer.

I'm going to watch the fuck out of that. |-| 
|-| coax3sq || 268 || I don't understand why this isn't blowing up everywhere. It was certainly better than the Ant Man trailer and this IS part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it just happens to be a 13 hour movie on Netflix instead of a 2 hour movie in theaters. 

I'm pumped and I hope this gets more publicity going forward. The Ant Man and Age of Ultron trailers were everywhere and viewed by millions in a matter of hours. 

I hope Daredevil is in Civil War, because they can used all the masked vigilantes they can muster up in that film.  |-| 
|-| coax4rg || 17 || Looks pretty good. I thought he was gonna go the In Bruges route for a minute there with that priest  |-| 
|-| cob14fu || 8 || I've never understood why daredevil's costumes always cover his ears. |-| 
|-| coaxteb || 8 || @33 seconds, thats Wilson Fisk aka The Kingpin.   |-| 
|-| coaw6rz || 20 || Is that the quivalent of the Dark Knight for Marvel ? Damn that looks good and violent.  |-| 
|-| cob1yb1 || 6 || For those wondering why this isn't "blowing up", think about what kind of character Daredevil is. He's a blind lawyer who has fairly weak super powers compared to the likes of Thor or the Hulk. He's always been a 2nd tier character, but that's his appeal. He's the underdog. No one expects DD to do much really. He's a street level "super hero" in a world where there are gods and magic.

But again, that's where the appeal comes in. In the comics he regularly held his own against much higher powered foes than him. He's bested the Punisher, fought toe-to-toe with Captain American, gave Namor a run for his money and can keep up with Spider-Man.

However with the tone of this trailer and I'm sure the focus of law, this won't be a kid's show. This is definitely darker and while still in the MCU, probably won't be mentioned anywhere else. This was usually the case in the comics whenever a large cross over event occurred. He's a street level super hero that stays in Hell's Kitchen. Most events pass him by, and sometimes even by choice. Of course he will pop up from time to time. But for those wanting him to come up in other movies, think about how Hawkeye wasn't even in Captain America 2, and he's in the Avengers. |-| 
|-| coayibu || 11 || I love the attention to the sound detail they put into the trailer, given the content.  It was...crisp, and every big noise was potent... well done trailer... got me kinda excited for this... |-| 
|-| coaxb52 || 4 || Well done.  Very excited to see this.  I'm a little nervous about "been there, done that" vibe I'm getting, but Daredevil is a fun superhero and Netflix is just awesome. |-| 
|-| coay3i4 || 5 || Fulton Reed as Foggy? I don't think I've seen him in anything since Mighty Ducks. |-| 
|-| cob1bcr || 4 || Dare Devil is my favorite marvel character and I read the comics all the time as a kid. I hope they don't eff it up like the Aflac movie. +pts for elektra |-| 
|-| cob8wtp || 4 || Holy crap - I went to school with him.

I knew he was into acting, but I didn't know how successful he'd become.  Good for him! |-| 
|-| coawznu || 9 || Looks like I'll be resubbing to Netflix in April.  Looks awesome. |-| 
|-| coaw80v || 18 || Trailer didn't sway me either way, it didn't suck but it didn't get me hyped. I'll remain cautiously optimistic, Marvel hasn't produced a show I've **loved** yet but I enjoy both SHIELD and Carter. |-| 
|-| coavzo1 || 3 || Looks pretty decent, didn't show too much action which is both good and worrisome, but im excited nonetheless. |-| 
|-| coaz48c || 3 || I love the darker tone than other marvel projects.  |-| 
|-| cob1vxs || 4 || This looks to take  a lot from Frank Miller and John Romita Jr.'s Daredevil graphic novel, Daredevil: Man Without Fear.

Black costume from there, Stick makes an appearance, throw some Typhoid Mary in and a little Electra and you got a stew going.

This is excellent news.

|-| cobsoqw || 4 || The show gained much notoriety, that Zach would break the proscenium arch and address the camera and audience directly.  Moonlighting, 1985, was the first show I'd see this done. But the first show that comes to mind that also did this was Dobie Gillis, 1959. I still believe Zach's character and his stage mannerisms are based off of Dobie Gillis, essentially a modern remake.   |-|

|-| cobqfva || 240 || No, reality TV garbage being the only original channel programming on every fucking station is to blame. It's their own damn fault.  
  
They started this eventual progress from targeted audience to "mass appeal" in their quest for huge short-term profit to the point most channels show the same themes and programs in one ocean of boring that have nothing to do with their channel name, and what a surprise, their subscribers left.  
  
Nickelodeon could get viewers again with dropping the teen live-action shit and edited versions of Japanese anime, then focus on original programming for targeted age groups again which includes grown former viewers in a later time slot. But NOOOOOO, actually making cartoons again would eat into those quarterly earnings reports, so they can enjoy a slow death while ironically blaming netflix, which IS spending money on original programming. |-| 
|-| cobrhsx || 89 || I love netflix.  My kids have grown up on netflix.  When we go to the big box store, they don't cry and through fits wanting the latest stupidest toy.  Why?  Because they don't watch commercials.  Commercials suck and most of the programming sucks. I have some bundle package from verizon with several hundred channels.  Do you know how bad it sucks to flip through 100's of crap channels?  I could use the menu but...  I don't want to see what channel I didn't subscribe to; I don't want tv stations that are 100% ads, I don't want to get to a station that took a 1h20m movie and turned it into 3 hours after commercials.  Verizon &amp; Comcast have made watching TV horrible.  Combine that with really bad reality tv and there remains no reason to keep watching. (In my case, my bundle is cheaper then the stand alone internet/phone package.  I use the phone for a fax machine for business purposes.) |-| 
|-| cobosyu || 74 || I call that karma for stabbing **The Legend of Korra** in the back, Viacom |-|

Agents of SHIELD's ratings jump  57% when you include DVR viewers. That doesn't even include OnDemand or Hulu/ABC Go viewers. Just because live viewing is down that much doesn't mean network viewing is down that much. I used SHIELD a cause it was the first show that popped into my head if anyone was wondering. |-|

If I am paying for cable I don't care who's watching it, PLAY SHOWS!  I went hulu, Netflix and amazon prime and over the air tv (Gotham is an awesome show NOT on cable).  I'm saving so much money now.  I possibly will NEVER do cable again! |-| 
|-| cobtkzo || 6 || Netflix and Amazon blamed?

Lol.

They should be blaming themselves for not changing with the times, man. Its their own damn fault.  Keep pumping them commercials, and channels and stupid shows nobody wants.

Granted, these large corporations are not known for their proactive approach to change, if it ain't broke why fix it. They are merely REACTIVE to changes; "let's see what they do and then copy it" or create their own version and use their contacts in the halls of power to keep control of the market, ala oligopoly.

...fuck.... I just made myself angry.

Add in the horrible customer service history of companies like Comcast and the high prices of things you can find either cheaper or free from other sources... They keep going with the same old model, not realizing that the base model itself has changed.  You can't keep driving around in your Model T, convinced it is going to last forever, when everyone else is living in the Jetsons. |-|

|-| cobsf7r || 4 || I enjoyed the '90s hip hop classics, especially when the kid had his grandma play Snoop Doggy Dogg on the boombox when he was about to make an entrance. |-| 
|-| cob5xy2 || 12 || It's a comedy about a kid and his family who all move from Washington DC to Orlando to open steak restaurant. It's about their adventures and trying to fit in at school and the neighborhood. Loosely based on the life of chef Eddie Huang |-| 
|-| cobn0al || 3 || I enjoyed the first two episodes.  I'm curious to see how the show progresses. |-| 
|-| cob8xda || 3 || What was the last one? |-| 
|-| cob9f02 || 3 || is there canned laughter? |-| 
|-| cob8s18 || -9 || I'm looking forward to this.

I like seeing Chinese people do shit. They crack me up. |-| 
|-| coaw87z || 29 || Yeah I don't think they kept accurate records that far back. |-| 
|-| coax6c2 || 14 || Not the first time I thought the Mountain was going to lose :D ... :/ ... :(  |-| 
|-| cob2y0y || 5 || I thought they meant a physical, rocky, mountain broke a strength record. I was like yeah, of course a mountain would break a record of strength. It's a mountain!

I am not a smart man sometimes... |-| 
|-| cob0at0 || 6 || My dad could still beat him up. |-| 
|-| cobg70b || 27 || Before people shit on the the Hollywood whitewashing, or how the source material was wrung clean, here's a quote from Eddie about his experience working on the show.

"After 18 months of back and forth, I had crossed a threshold and become the audience. I wasn’t the auteur, the writer, the actor, or the source material. I was the viewer, and I finally understood it. This show isn’t about me, nor is it about Asian America. The network won’t take that gamble right now. You can’t flash an ad during THE GAME with some chubby Chinese kid running across the screen talking shit about spaceships and Uncle Chans in 2014 because America has no reference. The only way they could even mention some of the stories in the book was by building a Trojan horse and feeding the pathogenic stereotypes that still define us to a lot of American cyclope. Randall was neutered, Constance was exoticized, and Young Eddie was urbanized so that the viewers got their mise-en-place. People watching these channels have never seen us, and the network’s approach to pacifying them is to say we’re all the same. Sell them pasteurized network television with East Asian faces until they wake up intolerant of their own lactose, and hit 'em with the soy. Baking soya, I got baking soya!"

It's a start, if this show gets popular enough, then you can start pushing the envelope more. |-| 
|-| cobkb2m || 25 || im excited for this. i hope it's good. i hope it doesn't get the axe after just a few weeks.

i'm (like many asian americans) tired of asians' complete lack of representation in american pop culture. it sounds petty and insignificant, but it means a lot to me to have asians in a major pop culture event where they aren't merely martial artists or comedy fodder. it means asians will be less the "other." through familiarity, the cheap stereotypes won't ring as true for many. that kind of pop culture exposure will actually affect my life and the way others relate to me, even if in a very small way.

obviously, this show is going to poke a little fun at asians (how could it not? it's literally called "fresh off the boat"). that in itself certainly isn't harmful. it's the difference between the chappelle show and a minstrel show. good racial humor considers the perspective of the minority. |-| 
|-| cobk7tq || 17 || Not bad so far. Randall Park and Constance Wu are hilarious. |-| 
|-| cobgy3k || 15 || For the first episode I compiled all the music and T-Shirts the kid wears:

|-| coblxaf || 11 || I'm an ABC (American-born Chinese), and so many of the events in the pilot actually happened to me in real life as a kid. Adults speaking super slow to me, complimenting me on my English, etc. It was a little hard on white people IMO but I thought it was a good start.  |-| 
|-| cobmw8w || 8 || First episode was okay, 2nd episode was much better, it very much reminded me of my upbringing, especially the interactions between the parents though my dad was more silent and passive when it came to my mom. That eldest kid is annoying as shit though.

Brainchild ftw! |-| 
|-| cobm5m6 || 21 || I can't get over how attractive I find Constance Wu |-| 
|-| cobs2bu || 6 || Asian-American here. I love this show already. I have so much pride and joy in how accurately it depicts my childhood and growing up in America, with conflicts of identity and family. The stereotypes that are depicted and seemed forced, they're really more or less true.

I just hope it gets enough viewers.

I also enjoy the small jokes about white stereotypes. It's like the writers decided to turn the table. |-| 
|-| cobs7lq || 6 || As a Taiwanese-American and restaurant employee, this show speaks to me on many levels.  A lot of the jokes were predictable, but executed very well (Constance stole every single scene she was in.)  I think as we get more episodes the show will figure itself out a little more, but it's off to a good start. |-| 
|-| cobttda || 5 || Listened to Eddie Huang's audiobook a couple weekends ago and finished it in a day and a half.  Big fan of his and his Vice food shows on YouTube.  Didnt know this sitcom was from his book until Randall Park and Eddie guested on Joe Rogan's podcast.

Too bad they didnt show how hardcore and gangster his dad was.  Literally a gangster from Taiwan and being a badass father in the States.

Show was funny as hell.  The kid, Hudson Yang, portrayed the young Eddie from the book pretty well in my opinion.  They said they filmed several episodes already (6?) so Im hoping this catches on with viewers.

Also, thumbs up for using "Andre" from The League to play the white host of the restaurant.  He's the EXACT same spazzy character.  The waitress is funny too. |-| 
|-| coblu76 || 4 || I really enjoyed Eddie's book when I read it last year. I was laughing to myself most of the time and then total shock when he got to college. He's basically living the American Dream. He's a successful business whose his own boss, living by his own rules and he's also pretty damn funny too. |-| 
|-| cobs4el || 4 || I was Eddie growing up...but I liked Ace of Base too.  |-| 
|-| cobw10d || 4 || There needs to be more chopsticks in this show. |-| 
|-| cobnw12 || 3 || In the 90's my bad was a family-business man who believed in the good in people (and was occasionally taken advantage of). 

My mom was a master of efficiency and was constantly doing the analytics of running the family. 

I was an Asian kid just trying to fit in as a normal American kid. 

Overall, I thought the show was pretty alright.  |-| 
|-| cobqtok || 3 || I really enjoyed this.   From what I understand they showed two episodes but I only saw the CLC episode which I enjoyed immensely.

Is this going to be on Hulu? |-| 
|-| cobl1zm || 5 || I wasn't sure at first, but with the first episode down, I actually enjoyed it! Wish I didn't have to sit through a Modern Family to see the next one. Guess it's Reddit time for the next 25 minutes! |-| 
|-| cobrn0i || -4 || Read a lot of positive reviews from critics (88% on RT), seen a lot of positive comments on Twitter, and now I'm seeing a lot of positive comments here.


I have to say I'm surprised. I thought it was horribly derivative and completely devoid of humor. This show has been done a thousand times, in a thousand different ways, and it kind of feels like it's getting a lot of love because of the diversity angle, which I'm all for, god knows I'm tired of sitcoms about oblivious white people looking for love in a big city, but I was really hoping for something innovative, and this was most certainly not. |-| 
|-| cobpabx || -8 || It seems more like a white producers version of Chinese America.

With 75% of Chinese Americans being foreign born, couldn't they have picked a couple of real first-generation actors to play the parts of the parents?

They couldn't even bother to hire a cheap Chinese consultant to write all the Chinese characters properly. |-| 
|-| cobs37a || 26 || Birdman eat your heart out. The stool bit made no sense until the pay off at the end. |-| 
|-| cobsimm || 7 || man now i have hype for when i watch it tonight. hope it lives up to it. |-| 
|-| cobv8bo || 5 || Charlie has shown that savant side of him on a few occasions.  But yes, this was very ambitious, and I thought it was one of their best ever episodes. |-| 
|-| cobt9zh || 4 || camera angle the whole episode was awesome. i've been to paddys pub location and dont think they film inside, so the editing from going in and out was flawless. such a great episode |-| 
|-| cobtehq || 6 || It was an amazing use of a tracking shot and a fantastic episode. He best long payoff was the chair. I couldn't figure out what he was doing there. |-| 
|-| cobu8kf || 6 || So the entire series, when they say "charlie work," they're referring to an incredible amount of attention to detail when it comes to keeping the bar spotless and clean? amazing |-| 
|-| cobt8vl || 18 || Well I guess it would have been a surprise...  |-| 
|-| cobuif2 || 14 || I think David Schwimmer is taking the same immortality pills as Keanu Reaves. Those guys aren't aging at ALL. |-| 
|-| cobv0dt || 13 || Episodes is such an underrated TV show. |-| 
|-| cobv4ik || 5 || Oh neat I could have sworn David Schwimmer became a full time Giraffe in 2005. Good to see he's still human, I suppose. |-| 
|-| cobvj4l || 5 || This was a hilarious episode. The 4th season that currently airs is great, and people who watch it should check out /r/Episodes, the subreddit for the show to discuss it, the sub could use some more activity. 

Also the seasons are only 9 episodes, so it's relatively easy to catch up! If you don't watch it give it a try, it's a quite a good show |-| 
|-| cobi5ra || 9 || I don't know who Sean Hayes is, but all of those bright colors and smiling faces made me not like him. Like, it was too much... Does that make me a bad person?

I loved Adam Pally's Late Late Show, so this reminded me of when The Gang Tries To Win Award and goes to the "award winning bar". |-| 
|-| cobfvxr || 11 || I hate that some people think that's more entertaining than Adam Pally's show. |-| 
|-| cob7puo || 6 || Bring back the redheaded cheerleader! |-|

|-| cob17t9 || 26 || I would imagine LOST had a few, but I started watching in on DVD because I couldn't handle the weekly breaks.
 |-| 
|-| coazejq || 40 || Not weeklong, but the year break that breaking bad took in season 5 was tourture. |-| 
|-| coazhvd || 8 || There were a bunch of episodes of 24 that I experienced this with. |-| 
|-| coazv76 || 9 || The finale of Sons of Anarchy (actually the last 4 episodes) I'm still not sure if they lived up to Sutter's hype, but the wait was agonizing. 



 It should be interesting to see what happens when/if GOT's catches up the the book series. That could be a hard wait.

Edit: forgot a word |-| 
|-| cob0g27 || 7 || I am experiencing this with Banshee right now. Almost every episode has been ending on a high note this season and it comes on Fridays so I have to go through the torture of Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday  |-| 
|-| cob3704 || 7 || The worst cliffhanger wait wasn't a week. But in TNG when Picard was captured by Cardassians and Captain Jellico took over, we had to wait months for the new season. This is back before the internet, too, so we literally had no idea if Patrick Stewart would come back. They put in so much work with Jellico, too, he could have stayed as a fully fleshed-out character.  |-| 
|-| cobafc5 || 7 || Between episodes of True Detective and Homeland was TORTURE for me.  |-| 
|-| cob4au4 || 18 || The wait between "To Talijee" (or however you spell it) and "Ozymandias" in Breaking Bad was pretty tough.   |-| 
|-| cob2cux || 5 || Season 1 of Heroes used to do that for me.  |-| 
|-| cob6fln || 5 || The past three weeks with Person of Interest have been hellish. That Trilogy storyline was good, but three weeks between the second and third episodes where pretty bad. |-| 
|-| cob3caa || 4 || Breaking Bad Seasons 4/5 &amp;
every 24 season |-| 
|-| cob6b90 || 4 || Game of Thrones is torturous… Because just speculation on which of my favorite characters is going to die next. |-| 
|-| cob9ojy || 4 || The wait between "The Blue Comet" (series' penultimate episode) and "Made in America" (series finale) for The Sopranos is the definite standout for me.

But for Breaking Bad, nothing compared to waiting for "End Times" after that ending of "Crawl Space". |-| 
|-| cob7xkw || 3 || Um, I think it was the first episode of Dexter's 7th season.  I won't spoil anything for anyone who has seen the series, but they went right for the throat in that first episode.  I thought they were going to reach a certain point at the end of the season... but they brought us there at the end of that first episode.  Couldn't believe it.  The wait for the next episode was worth it, too, because they kept that train rolling.  

The wait in between episodes of the final season of Breaking Bad were pretty tough, too.   |-| 
|-| cob1dkp || 7 || Basically every week for Gravity Falls because you never know how long it's gonna take before the next episode airs. |-| 
|-| cobcwda || 3 || I grew up watching LOST and 24 weekly when they aired (I watched LOST from the beginning to end all when it aired) and both shows always ended with a damn cliffhanger, especially 24 season 5 finale and LOST every finale was amazing  |-| 
|-| coaxhm3 || 16 || **The Flash**

This is probably my absolute favorite show on television. It is such a nice break from the doom and gloom, always serious, dark and gritty, two toned, super desaturated everything else (Game of Thrones, Gotham, Agents of SHIELD, Supernatural, etc). It is like that damn friend of yours that can't stop smiling. There are always great moments in each episode in which Barry uses his abilities not just to help and save people, but in a completely human way as well. Need to decorate the christmas tree? Boom, super speed! Need to change clothes super fast? Boom, super speed! Plus, last nights episode started to set up [Spoiler](#s "Gorilla Grodd") one of the more ridiculous villains from Flash's excellent rouges gallery. This show constantly brings a smile to my face with how excellent the character work is, and not to mention how not ashamed it is in its tone. |-| 
|-| cob2gp3 || 10 || Shameless (US version)


I tell people on a weekly basis to watch this show, it's ridiculous how little attention it gets. I watch allot of television and this is by far one of the greatest show's I've seen. 

It's the perfect balance of comedy and drama. Laugh out loud funny in one scene then heart wrenching the next. Every character shines on the show, even the background characters who only get one liners. It's on 5th season currently and has had some phenomenal character development for all the cast. 

The most underrated show on television  |-| 
|-| cob0ecp || 8 || Halfway through season 2 of the Americans and wondering why I didn't start watching this show sooner.  Keri Russell, Matthew Rhys, and Noah Emmerich are brilliant. |-| 
|-| coaz6to || 7 || **Orphan Black**

It was really great. For some reason I thought it would be some lighter, family friendly sci-fi show like Doctor Who so I was surprised when I found out how dark it is. I watched the whole first season in less than 24 hours. The second one was not so exciting but it was still great. The acting and effects are amazing too, I usually forget that all clones are played by the same Actress. Now I cannot wait until season 3 starts. |-| 
|-| cob0bsp || 8 || **Grimm**  
  
I'm about halfway through the first season now, I started watching it out of lack of other things to watch. The special effects are terrible and the plot is a bit shaky, but the theme is pretty good and it's nice that the main character can defend himself. There are a lot of shows with a similar style where the main character couldn't even throw a punch to save their life, let alone carry a gun.  
  
Does it get any better? I don't see it talked about much, if at all. It's on season 4 and seems to have pretty good ratings though. |-| 
|-| coaxsyi || 6 || Man Seeking Woman is a pretty solid comedy, and though I initially wasn't sure I it would be any good, it's been a lot of fun watching always sunny and this back to back |-| 
|-| coazb1r || 4 || Finally caught up on Parks and Rec. and I really enjoyed it. The new season is also great so far. It was getting bit repetitive so the skip into 2017 is a nice change. |-| 
|-| coaxqfj || 3 || **how to get away with murder** is back. not a great episode but I'm gonna watch the rest anyway. |-| 
|-| coay9g5 || 3 || Second re-watch of Breaking Bad.  In my top-3 of all time favorite TV dramas; Lost and The Wire are the other two.  

The precipitous decline of Walter White and the rise of Heisenberg in the first two seasons is what makes this show great.  Pure genius.   |-| 
|-| cob03tg || 3 || Borgia: Triumph &amp; Oblivion

The last season of the series. In so many ways inferior to the Showtime series that also chronicled Pope Alexander VI and family and yet I find it much more watchable and entertaining. |-| 
|-| cob0g8u || 3 || I finished rewatching my all-time favortie show **Avatar: The Last Airbender** last sunday (is it wrong that I found *Sozin's Comet* a lot more enjoyable than the Super Bowl?)

Now I'm watching the occasional episode of **MASH** (the best seasons newly arrived to Netflix), and meanwhile binging on **The Legend of Korra** (which if I time it right I'll finish on the 21st... the Tenth Anniversary of Avatar's premiere).
 |-| 
|-| cob435l || 4 || **Justified** - Sam Elliot and Garret Dillahunt are doing Deadwood-esque work here. Will be interesting to see how Boyd goes after them, while Raylan goes after Boyd.

**Person of Interest** - X is still alive, which is nice. Continuing to show the cracks in Team Machine.

**Jane The Virgin** - Reveal of Sin Rostro was great, Petra is developing from a crazy wild card character to someone genuinely sympathetic. |-| 
|-| cobj78o || 3 || **The 100**

I've finally caught up on and OMG it's is definitely good. There's lots of action and character development moves quite fast. It also goes to some really dark places that will definitely leave you shocked and gasping at each turn. [spoiler](#s "And it has elements of Firefly that I stupidly did not see coming.")    |-| 
|-| cobjcug || 4 || After finishing David Mitchell's memoir *Back Story*, I got a real craving to re-watch **Peep Show**, one of my all time favorite comedies. In the book he talked a lot about the creative choice of filming it in POV (and how hard that made things in the beginning when they did it with head-mounted cameras) and the format gives such a brilliant possibility of having the audience hear these inner thoughts of the characters, which makes some simple or traditional sitcom situations that much funnier. EDIT: [like this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEnMo78zE74), which Mitchell also uses an example of the format really making something simple and fun (out of shape man trying to run, fails) into a much more deeper experience of excitement followed by sudden defeat.

Just got to series three and it is such a great mix of mundane absurdity and cringe. Also enjoying how the supposed straight man Mark is actually the more psychotic one of the two in a lot of situations, especially with his obsession with Sophie. Bunch of brilliant supporting characters like Super Hans and Alan Johnson too. |-| 
|-| cobvbqc || 3 || **Angel**

I just watched the third and fourth seasons again, and I loved it much more than I thought I would. 

I used to focus a lot more on seasons 2 and 5, but 3 and 4 are really excellent.  |-| 
|-| cobo93a || 6 || It's a great premise, shot very well, acted well, great production value...i urge all to watch it. It explores a great what if in history. I hope it gets picked up. |-| 
|-| cobj44p || 3 || What's with the John Wick pic? |-| 
|-| cobo9cv || 3 || They need to turn this into a series ASAP |-| 
|-| cobbha8 || 14 || I can't believe they thought this was a good idea. It basically looks like a video game where he defeated the entire army by smoking.  |-| 
|-| cobi9qu || 4 || Waaaay over budget. They should've just taken a page out of this ad: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltqssfzVyrw

 |-| 
|-| cobpaw6 || 5 || See smoking helps you when you are under attack from a horde of monsters no wonder everyone smokes in the apocalypse movies. |-| 
|-| cobh4r5 || 3 || I knew I couldn't be the only one who thought this!!!!!!! |-| 
|-| cobble3 || 9 || I'm into my 3rd day without smoking. I'm a 7 year smoker. While I don't condone smoking at all, I hate how much non smoking propaganda they shove down your throat. I know its aimed towards teens but, damn. |-| 
|-| cobjxuf || 8 || God. I fucking loved that show. I was so bummed when it got canceled. They said there would be movies but we are still waiting.  |-| 
|-| cobilhb || 16 || Yeah I upped my whisky intake for that show too. Getting through The Wire was a rough winter smh never again heroin.  |-| 
|-| cobpjjj || 6 || We all know that Wu was the best character in that whole show.

"Sweggin! COCK SUCKA!" |-| 
|-| cobj84k || 4 || I love calamity Jane I call  Al Swearingen swear engine because he is. |-| 
|-| cobumip || 3 || Do you know who's coming back? I'm on my phone at work so can't look it up myself |-| 
|-| cobl39v || -12 || I do not care about this on so many levels.  |-| 
|-| cobsfi5 || 3 || And in 2017, Chicago Dogcatcher. |-| 
|-| cobmpi9 || 5 || Homeland and The Americans have amazing opening titles as well |-| 
|-| cobcsk4 || 4 || Marco Polo's opening is probably my favorite now. |-| 
|-| cobissa || 4 || Bojack Horseman's trippy opening reminds me a bit of *Hotline Miami*...well that and horseheads. That said, once you pay attention to the opening you actually learn quite a bit about the show itself.  |-| 
|-| cobgjo0 || 5 || Game of Thrones has the best opening titles. It changes for each episode showing places that will be shown during that episode. Also the theme song is badass. |-|
