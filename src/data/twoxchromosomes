|-| cnttc0h || 9 || It's perfectly normal, trust me, you aren't broken. Unfortunately I'm not an expert on the topic as I am male, but I had an ex girlfriend who was the same and I know she felt badly about it too. She had been a a few partners before and still wasn't able to. Eventually it did happen after about a year of being together. Which took us both by surprise because we didn't really do anything different even though we had tried many many different things along the way. 
What's most important is that you enjoy yourself. Don't feel like you have to try all the time, as long as you enjoy it then keep going and when it comes it comes. Definitely don't do anything you don't want to.  |-| 
|-| cnttple || 4 || You are not broken!! This is actually pretty common! So don't feel bad! While I understand why you are frustrated, getting upset it only going to work against you. The thing is, for a lot of people when you FIRST orgasm, it doesn't come easy. In fact it might only happen in one VERY SPECIFIC way. It's almost as if orgasming takes practice. I am very confident that you CAN do this, you just haven't quite figured out that one quirky method that's going to work yet. Just keep remembering, this is NORMAL and nothing to be ashamed of!

May I ask what methods you have chosen? If not I'll just say that for me personally, I was never able to come from finger stimulation or penetration or anything like that. For me and a lot of other women actually, I had to rub or grind the clitoris against an object like a pillow. Some people use the stream of water from the shower head or tub faucet. I might also suggest that for now at least, maybe focus less on the orgasm and more on the stimulation that would potentially lead up to it. Figure out what just feels good and play around with that for a good while. |-|

Try and love yourself for who you are, and try to accept and enjoy the way your body works right now.  Stress feeds itself, and if you go into sexual situations thinking 'oh man I hope THIS is the one, i hope THIS time i can meet my expectations' then you're setting yourself up for failure. 

Relax.  Enjoy yourself to the extent that you can, and try and make the most out of every opportunity.  When you can do this, you'll be able to recognize changes and embrace them when they come along.  |-|

I think people today expect perfection from a partner while demanding room to be as flawed as they want. No one is every perfect for anyone, any two people on Earth will piss each other off and hurt each other sometimes if they spend a lifetime together. Its about just making the decision to not give up on the other person for as long as they don't give up on you - to simply decide to make it work, rather than expect it to be perfect. |-| 
|-| cntu9nx || 24 || You can't be loose if he's cumming that quickly. Sounds like he just has PE and is looking to blame anyone but himself for it. |-| 
|-| cntudtu || 89 || Sorry things didn't work out between you too. Please don't be depressed over this guy, because he is not worth it. Your body is fine and let me explain why.

First, there is giant flaw in his argument. If your vagina is so loose, then why would he come so fast? The answer is: he wouldn't. So your vagina is fine. The problem is is that he is an asshole. 

Second off, every female's body has different shaped genitalia. So if yours is different, then guess what? EVERYONE's is different. 

Thirdly, what does puffy even mean? Seriously. We're talking about your lady parts not towels.

Which brings me to the most important part: he has performance issues. This makes him insecure. Trying not to lay blame at his own feet, he decides to blame you.

His decision to blame you for his own faults is why he is an asshole, why you shouldn't continue a relationship with him, and why you shouldn't be depressed over this. Don't waste your tears over this. It's his problem and he is blaming you. 

Do you realize what a giant fault that is in a person? What if he later blames his drinking on you? What if he blames his pornography addiction on you? What if he blames that his life is ruined because of you?

If he just had some sexual performance issues, you two would be fine. Because dealing with performance issues is a lot easier than trying to deal with someone who blames their problems on you.

Do you see what I'm saying? If it were just sexual performance issues, those can be worked through. You two could sit down and talk about what gets your motor running and what ruins the mood. You two could work with ways to reach mutual satisfaction like--you masturbate while he watches. Then when you find release, he could jump in and finish things off for himself. In a good relationship, the couple will find a way to work with their sexual performance concerns to find mutually satisfying encounters.

But sexual performance issues aren't the real problem here. This has nothing to do with his genitalia or yours. The problem is that he is blaming an issue of his on you. That's the real problem and don't loose sight of it. 

As a woman myself, I understand it is hard to know if your body is "normal" or not. So if you are really, really, really worried about your vagina, go schedule a visit to a gynecologist. It is their job to know what is healthy in female genitalia and what isn't. As long as you don't have an STD, I'm sure they'll tell you everything is normal and every one is built different. So long as you're healthy, you are fine.

The problem is him, not you. 

So dry those tears and move on towards someone who won't blame you for problems that were never yours in the first place.    |-| 
|-| cntuirg || 6 || &gt;Noting that those who describe their partner as their best friend see double the boost in well-being, the researchers conclude that it is the friendship offered by a spouse or long-term partner that’s most important. “Marriage, in a sense, is a super friendship,” the study’s co-author Shawn Grover explained to the Huffington Post.

Lets all remember this one the next time we have one of those terrible 'friendzone vs nice guy' debates, ok? |-| 
|-| cntun4i || 9 || You are too loose and puffy? That doesn't seem to make any sense to me. If he came quickly, he's probably very self-conscious about it and said what came to mind to take the blame off of him. He sounds young/immature. Did he say exactly that your vagina is loose and too puffy? Did he try other positions before coming to that conclusion? The reason that I think it's bullshit is that "loose" usually means that there is less sensation for the guy, or at least a different/unpreferred sensation that makes it difficult for him to come. 

Now, there's nothing wrong with you. All women and vaginas are different and you're supposed to be aroused! Maybe you're not what he prefers, that's fine. Every penis doesn't perfectly fit every vagina, but if you both are willing to work for it, it could be fun anyways.

Another thing, sometimes chemistry does not translate into bed. That's something you might have to live with. It can happen to you or the guy, but the excitement/lust might just not be there once you guys are having sex, perhaps a clash of personalities or one person is stuck on an ex, or even just the smell of the partner.

I know that it sucks and you totally feel rejected sexually, but this guy is absolutely immature. I bet he's totally insecure that he wasn't able to perform so well and didn't want you to think less of him, so he brought up some preferences that put his inability to perform on you (not necessarily intentionally). No, it's not your fault. You're made how you are and lots of guys will prefer it. (Puffy vagina complaint... I've never had any guy not get excited when they notice my vagina getting more puffy).

Now, grieve about this guy, but don't let it stop you from having fun in the future. Don't let on to the next guy that this guy said your vagina was loose/puffy and the next guy will never know! For confidence... fake it till you make it.  |-|

|-| cntuvtl || 8 || i was, and kinda am, like you.
i can't reach orgasm while masturbating using my hands. 

try a shower head! works like a charm. don't worry if it takes a while at first. when i started experimenting (i think i was even older than you) it took me about half an hour to actually come. now i can get there within a few minutes. the more you know! |-| 
|-| cntv4pi || 25 || There is no such thing as a soul mate.

I hang out on the relationships subs, and every time I see someone say "soul mate" or "one true love" or "the one", I cringe.

Those terms imply that there is one and only one person who will complete you and fulfill you and who you can be happy with.

You don't need to be "completed" or "fulfilled".  You are complete unto yourself.  Trying to rely on someone else for that is doomed because you're the only person that can do that.  If you're expecting that to come from outside, you're in for a big disappointment.

And then there are the numbers you mentioned.  If there really is one and only one person for you out of the billions on the planet, what are the odds that that person is in a class you're taking, or is a co-worker, or is a friend of a friend?

Almost nil, that's what they are.

The truth is that you are surrounded by people that you could form a happy and mutually beneficial relationship with.  And when you find one of them, it's so much better than it is with people you don't click with that it's tempting to say things like "YES, THIS IS THE PERSON I WAS MEANT TO BE WITH!"

|-| cntvv9o || 6 || I went through this for a while. It seemed like no matter what my SO would do I just couldn't get here. It led to him being frustrated or feeling like he wasn't giving me enough or doing enough and it just left me wondering if it would ever happen. I finally let him try going down on me and turns out that's what works. Sometimes it takes a while of it for me to get there but it happens every single time. It has even led it me being able to orgasm from regular sex which has been wonderful. I know it's not what you want to hear but don't give up! I bet there's something that will end up working and being what does it for you!  |-| 
|-| cntw1es || 5 || I am in the same situation as you. 24 and never had an orgasm. So many women say "Just get a vibrator" as is it's that easy but it still never has worked for me.  |-| 
|-| cntwcka || 4 || Just in case it applies to you: medication for depression can cause a person to be unable to orgasm.

Other than that, it could help if you don't put so much pressure on yourself. Don't make orgasm the end goal, make feeling good your goal. If what you're doing feels good, then that's great! Like others have said, try different things, but don't keep switching tactics in the same "session". For lots of women, it takes quite a long time of doing the exact same thing to get to an orgasm. If what you're doing is feeling good, keep doing that for as long as you want to. I suggest practicing alone, making sure you're relaxed and don't have to worry about someone walking in on you. |-|

|-| cntwj2l || 6 || OK, I was in the same situation. I had tried everything, but with such a lack of knowledge from friends, I was pretty much on my own. I came to realize that the female orgasm is as much mental as it is physical. The first thing you need to do is get some alone time, then find out what really gets you going mentally...play with different types of porn, etc. Once you get there, then you need to find out what pleases you physically. Play with yourself, experiment, do whatever you need to do. Also, don't stress out if you don't find it right away, because that will definitely keep you from finding it. Just have some fun. 

If you depend on a partner to find your spot, you'll never get anywhere, so go crazy. I experimented with vaginal and clitoral orgasms and finally got to the point where I can cum in seconds, with or without a partner.  |-|

One day I was struck with that super-horny feeling and just messed around with my unused vibrator, and BOOM, orgasm. It took another 2 years before I orgasmed with a partner, because becoming comfortable with it was difficult.

I just came here to tell you that you're not broken, and it's VERY normal. Forcing it or feeling bad that you can't is probably what's holding you back. Just wait until the overwhelming urge strikes you, and then do whatever feels good without the expectation of an orgasm. |-|

Shes gotta be really cranked up, a massage on her neck and back for quite awhile. if I want it to go faster/easier, after a hot shower.  Then I would start with just my hand, and work her up, (every now and then, I can get her to with just my hand) and eventually I'd go down her. 

Don't give up, it just takes a lot of practice. You are not broken, and I do not look at someone who needs more work as a broken person (If someone would, Fuck them). We struggled for 3 years, and we eventually got there(we are now on year 7).  Don't lose hope, it was tough. and she did and was like you explained, weepy and sad.  But we got there. |-|

You could go get a massage, get your nails done, whatever you want to do. Just try to maintain deep breathing and really let yourself go.

|-| cntzb6s || 4 || I believe in the right person at the right time, plus a *lot* of hard work.

I think the concept of "the one" is a big contributor to many relationship problems these days - people think they're supposed to meet the person they're "made for" and life will magically be happily ever after. That's not the way it works. Relationships take a lot of hard work, a lot of compromising, a lot of learning about yourself and each other.

I've told my boyfriend that if we'd met ten years ago there was no way we'd be dating. We needed the life experiences we had in the past ten years in order to be who we are today. If either of us had made a few different choices in that time, we never would've met. I think we still could've had happy lives with a different partner given the different life experiences, but this is what happened and we're now together. Going forward I think we will be able to grow and develop together. Maybe I'm odd, but I think this is an even more romantic view than a concept of "the one" - we actively made ourselves into a well-matched couple, and are happy to put effort into staying that way. |-|

I always felt a lot of pressure too and didn't think it would ever happen, I still enjoyed sex/masturbation but felt like there was this hill I couldn't quite get over. I still can't make myself have an orgasm with just my hands. I've noticed that the more turned on I am before anything starts the easier it is. See if you can find porn that really gets you going and watch it until you feel like you can't stand it anymore and take your time with yourself. For me the build up can be just as good as the orgasm itself, sometimes I actually miss being able to draw the pleasure out before orgasm. Once I was able to do it myself it made it much easier with my now husband. I wish you luck. You aren't broken, there are a lot of us.  |-|

It's the drug equivalent of having someone holding the drugs who doesn't realize what's in the package they are holding.)  The court was unable to prove he even knew there were child porn images on the computer.  All they could prove is that he had downloaded some legal pornographic material.  So they couldn't convict.

I'm not trying to defend the man, but this isn't a case like Ferguson where they didn't even put the man on trial.  He was put on trial, appropriately punished for what could be proven in a court of law (and with an ethics board) and then returned to work.  Yes, I'd argue an eye should be kept on him for further transgressions, but he has been appropriately punished for what he actually did and it shouldn't have any future bearing. |-|

&gt; Yet I am a woman with a vagina, and this becomes an area of my concern when people start saying that I shouldn't reference or acknowlege that—that it's in fact bad and intolerant so 20th century to even speak about it. The fact that some trans women don't have vaginas doesn't negate the fact that the vast majority of women do. And now, in the name of feminism, "female-validating talk about vaginas is now forbidden," as one anonymous writer on a Mount Holyoke messageboard put it. "That's so misogynistic under the guise of ‘progress.'" 

This is a consequence of the way the war on equality was fought for the last 30 years.  If you did not like tearing down 'men' with redefined language that seems alien to a simpler reality, as it is being used against you now, you should have been out there fighting for sanity, rather than letting a lunatic fringe determine the shape and scope of the movement.

Its an awful taste of one's own medicine, but the blueprint for successful acceptance has been writ, and in a large part it involves denying those 'higher' on the ladder the right to freely assemble in their own spaces.  All those years spent fighting against men-only golf clubs are coming home to roost.

So no, you don't get to hold events for biological women only.  Get used to it.  The golfers already have. |-|

|-| cnu1y73 || 3 || I think that "soul-mate" like relationships can and do happen, but I would never say that it's something people should expect. But there are highly compatible people, depending on upbringing and life events, as well as personality. 

And there are also very coincidental things that can happen to two people... The circumstances leading up to me and my partner meeting were crazily by chance, so it seems special, even if it is by chance. We've essentially been together from the moment we met - not romantically for the first little while, but once we were in each others lives, we never stopped spending time together. 

And our relationship seems to become more and more like we are newly dating as we are together for longer. The excitement grows. I can easily see us together for many many years, as it's already been many and probably our whole life. 

I think there is more to compatibility than personality or meeting circumstances, like our biology / genes / hormones etc.

|-| cnu2tyt || 3 || There are no soul mates.  I wonder who it was who decided to make up such a silly idea.  I think that the concept has been romanticized because it is easy and passive.  Love takes vulnerability.  Sure, it feels like a soul mate at the height of oxytocin saturation.  It feels like this person exists just for you and vice versa.

I still consider my fiance my partner for life and my 'one', but I fully understand that he is my one and only because I choose for him to be so.  Every day.  First you fall in love and then it becomes a decision.  

I consider him my 'one' because we grew up thousands of miles away, but somehow lived parallel lives.  We hid parts of ourselves from the world out of fear of ridicule only to realize that those very things are what we love most about each other.  When I see him, I see me.  We make each other better human beings.  Our life goals, loves, hobbies coincide and that works for us.  My weakness are his strengths and his weaknesses are my strengths.  We work together to create our niche in this world.  Its different for everyone, but this is our happiness.

A forever partner can be a reality, a predestined soulmate is a fairytale.   |-| 
|-| cnu2tz3 || 6 || As a male, there is a large amount of pressure on many in my generation  to be able to make our partner orgasm. That if we don't, we're failing, we're bad partners, and a bunch of other stuff. That if a woman doesn't orgasm, she's not enjoying herself and will leave you.

As a male, having a woman who was a long term partner talk to me about the female orgasm was helpful. That a woman can enjoy sex without orgasming. She also explained by putting so much pressure on it, it was making it harder for her to orgasm. So, for me as a male, having that conversation with a trusted partner really got me off that idea that I was a "failed partner" and she was unhappy since I didn't get her off. |-|

|-| cnu3gb3 || 6 || I have a different take on soul mates. I believe we have lots of them, and they aren't only limited to romantic lovers. I think of my best friend as one of my soul mates, along with two of my oldest guy friends AND my current boyfriend. I think enemies can be "soul mates" too. Basically anyone you're destined to encounter and have an intense relationship with of any sort. (Whether or not you believe in destiny is a different story. I personally do)

I don't believe in the idea of "the one" when it comes to romance. The very concept suggest that we're meant to only have one great love in our lives, and I think that's total bullshit. I have had three very serious adult relationships aside from my current partner, and I learned and grew from all of them. 

And the fact is, there are only so many looks, styles, voices, qualities, interests, worldviews, etc. that a person can have. Just by the numbers, there are people out there who are borderline identical to each other. And there are probably thousands upon thousands of compatible people that any of us could have a happy relationship with. "Forever" only matters when you've actually made it work with one of those people long enough to start developing a world together and making it last. We romanticize it because it's a beautiful idea, but I think that romanticizing also damages us because it makes it harder to let go of relationships that aren't working. We think of "forever" as "win" and breaking up as a failure. That isn't right. No relationship is ever a failure if you learned from it. |-|

|-| cnu56bt || -3 || This is a tricky subject. 

On one hand, we DO need to draw a line somewhere. I know I've read horror stories about people in China getting abortions at like 8 months, and clearly at that point a baby is a baby, and the only thing separating it from infanticide is the location that the baby is in. 

But at the same time, after conception/implantation, there really is no clear line you can draw and say "ok, this is the point of no return." We don't have a clear definition of what is even required to define a fetus as a baby, and o n top of that they all develop at slightly variable rates anyway. The whole "fetal pain" thing is just as variable as any other criteria. 

I don't think 22 weeks is a bad place to set the post, honestly. That's 5 months. That's a lot of time to get counseling if you need it and make a good decision about it. And if we make abortion readily available to all women who need one, that is more than enough time.  |-|

|-| cnu5ztv || 3 || I've always thought being inclusive solved all social ills and this will do the same as we hope others will.

By supporting gay marriage, gay adoption, and gay equality, we bring more cases into Court where it is father against father and mother against mother instead of the same cases we have seen for 200 years. This type of inclusiveness will bring about laws that are more fair to people of all genders and sexual orientations as old ideas are challenged and shattered. Change brings change to put it quite simply.

For a hundred years, we have been tearing down old walls, old gender roles, and old ways of doing things until we have reached new territory. Instead of being the oppressed minority looking to tear down walls, new groups are preparing to tear down walls of their own. That will bring a new level of understanding, tolerance, and inclusiveness as they understand what it is to be on the receiving end.

Maybe, just maybe, we can start to make some progress as everyone, even those that consider themselves progressive, have to accept that they still have ground to cover themselves.

My boyfriend doesn't care, he even pops them for me, lol. Fuck acne though. |-| 
|-| cnu6twd || 4 || Waiting for it to bloody well happen already.  I was 17 / 18 when I finally started growing tiny boobs.  All the boys picked on me and the girls felt superior because they'd developed already.

|-| cnu7hv9 || 13 || This makes me think of the Jane Collective in Chicago from right before the Roe v. Wade case. It's a pretty amazing story. A group of women started a collective to provide safe, affordable abortions. They performed over 11,000 abortions. I wonder if anything like this would happen again in the US if abortion were to be criminalized.

It's not as if there is a clear bold line where it is or isn't okay to have sex with someone, even the legal line is sometimes skewed. This article seems to be under the impression that this "get-out-of-jail-free card" only exists for men when [it quite obviously doesn't](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-12-22/features/9612220045_1_pay-child-support-child-support-behalf).

|-| cnu81cc || -14 || Both sides are at fault for believing that their views alone fix the problem. Whether or not abortion is legal, women are still suffering. Either they're not able to get a safe abortion or they're put in a situation where they feel an abortion is their best option. 

The issue here isn't abortion. If we weren't so awful about caring about women BEFORE they get put in this situation, maybe we wouldn't have this problem. 

Maybe if we cared a little more about each other, we could actually get something done. 

All I see here is how I'm a shitty human being because I have a dissenting opinion. For people that claim to champion the rights of women, some are more than happy to insult women who disagree instead of cultivating a legitimate discussion to address the multitude of problems surrounding this issue. |-|

|-| cnu88bv || 6 || Everyone in my class got everything before I did. First, I was several months younger than all of my classmates (in some cases, a year younger) and second, I was a very late bloomer. I spent most of high school shy and withdrawn because I wasn't like anyone else, and then when the hormones hit, it was a disaster. 

I got my boobs and my period the summer before my senior year in high school - I was almost 17. I went from having absolutely no chest to a b cup overnight. It hurt, it was awkward and it was the center of attention when I went back to school in the fall. My new nickname was "boobage". Yeah, nice. Not only were the hormones horrible to deal with, but I became a raging horny psycho.  |-|

|-| cnu9yid || 4 || Maybe having dark leg hair and touch of unwanted chin hair.  My family was decent about preparing me for periods and boobs.  I knew those were coming like it or not.  However, no one bought me a razor and shave gel.  No one taught me how to shave.  I think my mom assumed I'd ask for those things and just know that razors were for removing hair.  I finally asked about how to get rid of leg hair after getting made fun of at gym class by another girl.  I wish books, parents, and puberty lessons in school talked more about all of the changes.

Period were a close second bad too because I got started on frikkin cardboard applicators and thick pads.  Ugh, so not comfortable.  Also, no one warned me about the consequences of sitting for a long time, like though a class, and then standing up on the heavy period days. |-|

If you've reached out to him already and he hasn't reciprocated the best thing you can do for yourself is to cut your losses and move on. It hurts, believe me, but doing the painful thing of cutting contact is so much better than putting yourself through perpetual agony by hoping there's a chance you'll be together. Cut your losses, allow yourself some time to be sad, and anticipate the wonderful new experiences that lie ahead!

Bon courage! :) |-| 
|-| cnucg96 || 11 || I really think you'd benefit from dating. Go into it without the intention of long term, but you need to see what else is out there.

It was embarrassing. I got picked on at school. My mom wouldn't let me shave but then I would always hear her speak ill of women who didn't shave their armpits.  So logical right? Now I accept that I am hairy and my boyfriend doesn't care one bit.  |-| 
|-| cnud837 || 6 || So I used to have the same exact problem, and there are two things that i think really helped. I'm really sorry if this is super graphic, but I feel the need to help a fellow sister out.
1. This was actually my husbands idea. I don't know about you but I LOOOOVE my vibrator. My husband knew that I was having trouble getting pleasure from oral, so he would start by using my vibrator on me. Right when I could tell I was getting close to orgasm, we would move in and finish orally. Since then, I haven't had any problems with oral OR if I do, he just starts with the vibrator 
2. Once, when he wasn't quite hitting the right spot, I got frustrated and literally grabbed his head kind of just started grinding against his face. I'm sorry for the very explicit info, but it worked! And (bonus!) he loved it! |-|

Figure out how she got pregnant since you both agreed no kids, and take appropriate steps to prevent it from happening again. And remember, just because she wants the procedure now, doesn't mean she can't or won't change her mind last minute, be prepared for that too.Also, if she has the procedure, she may still be upset about it. Wanted or not, it is a loss, hormones take a hit and some people have to grieve.

You can't really know what kind of a person he is, or what kind of a partner he would be, or if you'd even enjoy his company at all if you haven't seen him in that long. You *do* know that he hasn't cared enough to respond when you made the first move on two occasions. I think /u/JanetSnakehole24 has the right idea. You need to date.

No one deserves to be treated the way he treats you.  You can do better, and you deserve better.  He is not good enough for you, and never will be.  No one who says those things is good enough to have a relationship with anyone.  No one who threatens someone else with a knife deserves any contact.

Delete his number from your phone, remove his email/Skype/anything else you may have been using to contact him, and do not see or speak to him ever again.  He is dangerous, and clearly not in his right mind.

He threatened you.  With a KNIFE.  This time he only brandished it at you, but next time he might kill you with it.  Stay away, please.  Your life is worth way too much to risk it by being anywhere near him.  He doesn't love you, he wants to own you; he sees you as property that he can use and abuse however he likes.

You do not belong to him, you belong to you.  You don't owe him anything.  You owe yourself the respect and love that he will never give you, and part of respecting and loving yourself is staying the hell away from someone who abuses you.

You deserve better.  Keep that in your mind, if nothing else.  You deserve better. |-|

Remember that you are not the first couple to go through this... encourage her to talk to girlfriends who have gone through it - she just needs lots of support, and doesn't need to feel any shame or pressure. If she feels it's the right decision, don't let anybody tell her otherwise. When it's over, you need to have a serious talk about your contraceptive practices, etc, but for now just keep things simple. Best wishes for you both.  |-|

It will help you overcome wanting to be with this sort of person and help you realize that you're worth SO much better than this. 

The hard part is over. You've realized you need to do something different and you're reaching out for help. Make yourself RIDICULOUSLY busy. And if he calls, do whatever you can to ignore it. If he shows up, tell him you're done. Don't entertain any conversations with him. Just say "i'm done" repeatedly until he goes away. 

The best advice I can give you is to just be busy. Fill your schedule with things you enjoy. Read a book. Reddit! Do a craft. Bake something. (whatever your hobbies are) Have a friend be your accountability partner and check up on you. Call/text them instead of him. Browse online dating profiles (even if you're not ready to commit) and rate them hot or not. Dateable or not. You'll start to see that there are plenty of fish in the sea :)

|-| cnup3cc || 3 || The other responses have pretty well covered it.. as long as you BOTH are fully aware that you don't see this being long-term, it may be okay. But you really have to consider.. what is the purpose? If you think maybe you could be with them long term, but just don't want MARRIAGE, that's one thing. But, if you know for sure you don't want to be with them for the long term and would leave them as soon as you found someone you felt *could* be marriage material, then you need to question your heart a bit more on why you are staying in the relationship. Because it's fun? Because the sex is good? Because you're afraid of being alone? Not the best reasons. If BOTH of you are on the same page, maybe it could work, but generally there's no reason to stay in a relationship that you know will never go anywhere else. And it's more likely the other person isn't on the same page as you, so if that's the case it's definitely not right. |-|

I don't think that's fair at all. They had personalities, and their bra size was never focused on and barely even mentioned. If you look at, say, Conina's talents as a barbarian but desire to be a hairdresser and see a bra size... maybe the issue isn't with the book itself.

If you want to criticize these early books, the role in the story of the women in them is probably more of a valid issue then the idea that they didn't have personalities. Not that this article didn't do that, because it did. |-|

|-| cnupru9 || 3 || if you are "dating for marriage", then the minute you or your partner know that marriage is off the table, then it needs to end. 

I had that with my last boyfriend. I was very clear, and he seemed on board for some time. BUT at some point he decided that not only was marriage within 3 years not an option- he said 5- he wanted to continue exploring other women. He just didn't tell me that. He didn't cheat physically, but the emotional betrayal was huge and had a large fiscal and logistical effect on my life.

Dating somebody because you love being with them is FINE. But that needs to be said. I dated a man I wasn't sure about, but I wanted to see where it would go. I think he was more sure, but never told me until he had started "shopping for houses for us to move into". That was very hurtful, because I wasn't ready for that and it was overwhelming. It also didn't take into any of my other life plans, just his.

My man now, well, we put it right there on the table really early. We are both looking for a partner at this point, and we didn't want to date anybody who wasn't looking for the same. We talked about our deal breakers a little while after that, and we've been going great and strong, figuring out US as a team. 

All that said, you can have very fulfilling and important and satisfying relationships even if marriage is not in the picture. As long as you talk about it and are both on the same page. |-|

|-| cnuy0u6 || 10 || Sexual assault and mental health issues are often taboo in Asian American culture. It's an unfortunate (but pervasive) issue that can come from the generational gap produced by immigration. These issues are things that are heavily stigmatized, and if your friend's parents grew up abroad, or grew up in a first generation immigrant household, it's likely that they grew up in an environment where these things weren't talked about or adequately addressed. 

Though I don't know your friend's situation, I'd venture a guess that her parents are concerned about her well-being, but believe that it would ultimately be better for her to ignore what has happened in order to move past it. There's an element of "face" (saving face, a common sentiment in Chinese &amp; Asian cultures) where one doesn't want to publicly share something that would shame the family. The focus on the family though is something that ultimately comes back to the individual - shaming the family is shaming the individual, and making life harder for the person who has spoken out because they have to deal with the negative reactions of those around them.

Though this answer doesn't fully help the situation at hand, maybe it gives you a little bit more insight of where her parents might be coming from?  |-| 
|-| cnuypq2 || 9 || Are they Korean? They sound Korean. If so, it has nothing to do with christian evangelicalism and more to do with Korean Confucian society. A rape involves 2 or more people. It is the general belief that men more or less have this uncontrollable urge to have sex. It is up to women to not put themselves in situations where even an unwelcome advance would take place. If there was a rape, and there was no signs of violence or clear evidence such as video proof, Korean society will overwhelmingly pass judgment in terms of what I just said. Most Korean parents know that their daughters have premarital sex and drink with men, but choose to deny this fact for the sake of family standing in the community.  |-|

|-| cnv0is7 || 9 || Korean American Christian here, we do not trust courts or the police and we suffer in silence rather than get them involved in our lives.


We had a family member who was abused by her husband and abandoned, family members took her in after the ordeal. Our family lived through the LA riots were run into poverty in 2 nights and know that there's less justice for Asians in America than for..... well anyone else. It's better these days (hey, we're probably a bit ahead of some minorities now, but that's nothing to celebrate), but we like staying out of court. We don't like antagonizing people. It's not how we do things.


So basically, you have a hardworking immigrant family of Korean War veterans who went from less than $100 in their pockets to millionaires in decades of hard work, who once again went into poverty after the LA riots, 4 "nuclear" families living in a single house. We're better off now, but the current generation of our family grew up poor and we're now just breaking back into lower middle class.


We had a family member that was raped multiple times. She was something of a troublemaker, never listened to advice, and generally was very whimsical, coming and going. The family's attitude to the local PD is that they are invasive and around the same level as rapists. We did not want them involved. We wanted to stay out of court, court in America is almost as bad as court in Korea (which you should definitely stay out of, the legal side over there may actually be as bad as rapists). They just wanted her to find a new workplace. They generally felt that they had survived a lot of shit and should keep on doing so rather than risking police and law involvement.


I've seen other families generally just encourage people to take hush money and move on. Our community generally does not want to get involved with police. Some Korean business owners (like everyone else) under report and take cash only (think laundromats and nail places). The police that come to those people usually have a grudge or want a bribe- the community is generally (like many other minority communities) is not fond of the police.


Now, if your friend was a Korean Christian, the parents may have good reason. First, there are some Korean "evangelical" churches are not what you think they are. There are some churches that have widespread membership in Korea that would be considered cult-ish in America. Some of these are very successful power brokers. An example is that the owner of the Sewol Ferry (that boat that sank and killed a bunch of high schoolers).


Her family likely does not want to mess with these guys for very, very good reason. That's like messing with Scientology. Chinese Christians can be as frightening. There are powerful cults there that can and have had people killed. There are some Asian groups that believe that X person is Jesus reincarnated or returned, and some of those organizations can easily get a bunch of violent people to hurt someone. It has happened.


The second incident: prestigious institutions are very hard to sue in Korea and China. Chaebol have gotten away with a lot in Korea and China is no different (most likely a lot worse). They can also destroy your life too, though I suppose your friend and her family could just never go back to Asia.


I don't know about Chinese or Japanese, but Korean culture has a lot about being wronged and suffering in silence. That's pretty much Korean cultural identity. 


tl;dr: My family would say "You already got raped and now you want to police in your life too?!" LAPD is bad as rapists in their eyes, California juries are a mixed bag and often somewhat racist, and they wouldn't even dream of something as outlandish as justice in a Korean court. |-| 
|-| cnv19lp || 5 || &gt;“These findings offer new insights that may be useful in guiding policymakers and organizations that are interested in reducing gender inequality and improving the work and family lives of young men and women.”  

There's the problem. They assume that policymakers might want to reduce gender inequality and improve the lives of young men and women. Sadly that's just not true of at least this current crop of politicians.  

The GOP is the party of fear-mongering and maintaining the status quo - they want absolutely nothing to do with gender equality or improving peoples' lives (unless those people are worth more than several million dollars).  |-| 
|-| cnv1q89 || 57 || guy here, take my 9-5 and leave me home! |-| 
|-| cnv1vgp || 3 || I'm a South Indian Christian guy so take what I say with a grain of salt. Basically, if these parents are like mine then the parents may come from a culture where virginity and chastity are still seen as ideal traits of femininity, and are associated with being a good mother/wife. As a result, the women in these societies are often seen as idealized objects by their parents instead of actual people. But rape is still common in India and so these two realities are often put at odds. 

It may seem a little bit ridiculous at first, but when you put it in context it makes a bit more sense, although some parents still take it to extremes. The idea is that women are married off and the family pays the groom's family a dowry. Marriage in Indian culture, and I'd wager to a larger extent most Asian cultures, is seen as a sort of Agreement more than an act of love. Love and compatibility are taken into account, but both parties are expected to sacrifice to preserve the sanctity of the greater whole. Sacrifice in general plays a huge role in Asian culture if you ask me. Both the bride and groom are expected to fulfill certain duties, and these duties extend outward to their families as well. The bride's duty is basically to be a good mother and loyal wife (there are other things too but it's easier to keep it simple here; for example highly accomplished women only get paired off with highly accomplished men; high caste/status men with high caste/status women). Any sort of perceived violation of these duties raises the dowry. Premarital sex is common in India, but still seen as a violation of these duties if it becomes known prior to a wedding and the dowry gets raised. Rape is stigmatized in large part because it allows one family to strong arm another family into paying a huge dowry to marry off a daughter. So basically rape is seen as a family failure as opposed to just a personal trauma. The father failed to protect his daughter etc. 

Some people will dissociate themselves from this blame by publicly distancing themselves from their daughters when something like this becomes known to others. Until then they may try to cover it up and prevent others from knowing what happened, because once the dowry is paid and she's married off their duty is fulfilled and it doesn't matter.

So in America these immigrant families rarely if ever (I can't think of a single case myself) pay each other dowries but the traditions of honor and sanctity still remain. 

It's interesting because especially in South Asia, where premarital sex is becoming more and more prevalent (it was always prevalent but it's becoming more open now), if these families (actually only the middle/upper class families since the poor families still have to pay huge dowries) were still living there they probably wouldn't function this way. But since they left their homeland a long time ago, they still think things are the way they are back home when they've evolved without them.


I think Indians are largely distrusting of police because of how corrupt and abusive they are in India and because they see the way black people are treated by them here in America. Police are generally avoided, and nothing is expected to come from them. My family in particular has had bad experiences with American police involving them not investigating or following up in someone's murder. I'd wager that most Asian populaces in America feel about the same. 

Then, there's also the issue of Christianity in Indian culture, and to an extent Asian cultures. Christianity is a very Western (only way to put this without offending people) ideology that has been transplanted into certain Eastern societies. As a result, all sorts of weird things happen as tradition and religion intertwine. Ultimately, I'm of the opinion that Christianity is largely incompatible with Eastern philosophy if any deep thinking is applied, but that's just my opinion.

Anyhow, if your friend would pursue legal action her family would probably distance themselves from her even further. It is what it is. I think if you're Asian American you sort of have to expect to find yourself distanced from both the Asian part and the American aspects of yourself and this includes having distant family members and finding it hard to relate to non-Asian friends. Asian cultures still have huge issues with treating women as objects but also have some issues dealing with public failure or accepting mistakes (like all cultures/people really).  |-| 
|-| cnv227j || 26 || ...They *say.* Self-reported data.

I'll believe it of working mothers who are willing to let their husband be the primary parent; unemployed men who are still dateable; people who view work-life balance as a human issue rather than a women's issue; and men who, as much as women, worry about balancing parenthood with career.  Otherwise I'm going with people knowing the right answer. |-| 
|-| cnv23ek || 3 || Before reddit gets on its armchair cultural sociology high-horse, I want it to be open to the possibility that decisions made by individual families are made as a result of their own worldviews and social dynamics.

I understand that you're writing this from a third party perspective and out of concern, but I think it is important that you realize what you are, a third party; any conclusion you draw as a result of race or whatever other factor may be at play is simply your less-than-perfectly-informed inference, and is not reflective of anything other than your own interpretation of the situation. |-|

|-| cnv2auk || 47 || Some devil's advocate here: assuming most of the study participants haven't been in an egalitarian relationship, how can we be sure that they would actually be happy in one? Even assuming they're speaking honestly to the best of their ability, people are pretty bad at predicting what they actually want. In this particular case, an egalitarian relationship takes work: you don't just *have* an egalitarian relationship, you *make* an egalitarian relationship, on an ongoing basis. Being asked a question like this, it's easy to forget that.

To be fair, I think the claim of the study is true. I'm just not sure the methodology really proves it.

|-| cnv2lfm || 36 || Does it mean much though?  I've read multiple articles citing several surveys (including Pew Research earlier in 2014), that when asked more specific questions on gender roles/gender stereotypes, most people ended up upholding and reinforcing those gender roles.  I also do recall from some psych lectures that psychological studies on dating behavior provide even stronger evidence for this.  It turns out that when things get serious, people end up revealing their true beliefs/bias. 

An example from a business insider article I saw a while back (I'll try to find it later) was that the vast majority of women still find a man's career/income to be a major factor in dating, compared to men.  However, men tend to rank attractiveness at greater importance than women.  Of course, surveys should always been taken with a grain of salt, since it doesn't remove bias like psychological studies can. |-|

Have you considered an IUD? I'm pretty close to the start trying for kids point, so I didn't want to get one and risk side effects only to remove it a few months later, so it's not right for me, but it may be a good option for you. Definitely worth doing some research at least.  

And obviously it's your prerogative to say no to sex at any point, but yes, hormonal birth control can negatively impact sex drive, and yes, sometimes it's worth it to just do it anyway.

But when it comes down to it, women *expect* or ultimately do more than their partners, even if they *want* to split things evenly ([Askari et al., 2010](http://171.67.121.89/content/34/2/243.full)). Might be a self-fulfilling prophecy, or it might just be that what their male partners see as equal really isn't, such as not factoring in childcare, dishes, laundry, etc. as part of regular housework. IIRC, researchers have illustrated that women tend to do more everyday chores while men do the every-once-in-a-while chores, like mowing the lawn, grilling, taking out the trash, or washing the car.  |-|

|-| cnv56d9 || 3 || I think the problem here is, most people would presumably say what they think is socially expected of them to say, which is that they'd split everything down the line 50/50 and that women and men are virtually indistinguishable, there are no gender specific traits etc. However, when it comes down to it their true beliefs may be totally different. There's also the issue that all of these people are unmarried and childless, they possibly may never have had any serious relationships and are just reiterating what they've been told by society without ever putting it to the test for themselves to see how it works out for them. |-|

Children are something of a time-limited thing (if you wait and wait for him to lose the weight so you can start trying, you run the risk of running out of time, and if he's decided losing the weight to be active with your kids isn't as important to him as it is to you, you need to budget time to find someone who shares your priorities), so it's important that you make sure you're on the same page.  Maybe have a game plan going into a sit-down talk - "I've worked out a rough plan on how we can achieve your old goal - what are your thoughts?" - so you can make a SMART goal, which will be easier to achieve.

This is true, and is probably something that you should mention to him. He knows he's overweight, and unhealthy, going on about this is not going to get you anywhere. Tell him that you are unwilling to bring children into the family while he cannot be an active part of their lives.

|-| cnvbp0s || 70 || I used to be like this. Hated women, hated popular kids, hated anybody with a gf/bf. I eventually realized I hated myself more than anything, and all the problems I had were my own.

The whole scenario is a vicious cycle, and it takes tons of effort to get out. Someone who is made to be an outcast in school or whatever will never learn to be 'normal' until something finally gives them a reason to change. You have to change your entire life to break free.

I felt like I was behind in my social skills. I was always anxious when I knew I had to interact with somebody; I had to rehearse my 'lines' in order to go to the corner store, forget trying to make friends. I also felt I was missing out on what I should have been experiencing as a teen: relationships, friendships, parties, and yes, sex. I was driven by sex every day, masturbating 3-4x after school and work. Sex is a huge motivator, and it really sucks that nobody talks about it. It's such a huge drive; I would hide boners everyday in class, and I never talked about it because it was gross. Nothing could cement a guy as a 30 y/o virgin quicker than being that kid who had a boner in class.

Girls are the only ones with the ability to give you what you want. It almost seems unfair that they have so much power over you for something that could have gone either way (being a guy or girl). It seems like they don't even care about sex as much as you do, and you think about it every time you see one. It seems like it would be so easy for a girl to give you just 10 minutes of her time so it wouldn't matter anymore. It gets worse when you see how the cool and athletic kids are treated by them, and how girls truly had all the social power. Some of it is imagined, but I still believe a lot of it is true.

As I graduated, I started realizing people didn't like me because I was a boring loser. I hit my rock bottom (hopefully) and spent years changing my life. It doesn't pay off immediately. People don't just become friends with you because you start hitting the gym, going to school, get a better job, etc. You need time to meet people and 'prove' yourself, and it is a steep slope where you fall and get hurt a lot. You need to put yourself out there to develop social skills and relationships. You have to risk failure. I consider it just a part of living now, but me from 4 years ago was too comfy playing Starcraft every night blaming women for my problems to realize that people don't just get lucky when it comes to relationships and social success. It definitely doesn't seem like this would be the truth in high school.

In a way, I sympathize with guys like this and Elliot Rodger; his manifesto is so similar to my experience, it's scary. I think that their actions are a result of perceived shortcomings in our modern environment. In a way, I do think our society teaches boys to hate women, but in an indirect way where jealousy and frustration turn into hatred and anger; nobody is directly telling these boys that they are owed sex. The solution is clearly not 'manipulate girls to have sex', but honestly, maybe we need support for guys who feel like they are missing out or are undesirable. |-|

If you are always 100% certain that your partner wants to have sex, there will never be a question of consent - either in your mind, or in your partner's mind.  If you are both 100% "good to go", no one is going to be waking up in the morning with regrets. |-|

Maybe he would have been able to find a willing sexual partner if he got help for his problems and learned that other people are not objects for your pleasure. Don't get me wrong, I completely understand that it isn't exactly the easiest thing to admit when you need help-it took me years before I finally got up the courage to tell my parents that my depression was out of control-but goddamn. Things like this just make me sick to my stomach.  |-| 
|-| cnvfjm8 || 3 || You can switch doctors. Most importantly, you have the right to the medical care you want. If you're not happy on the pill, TELL them that you want to try alternatives. This isn't something where you have to sit and wait for the doctor to suggest it. They work for you.

And there's nothing wrong with you! It's just the way your body is reacting to the shitty artificial hormones. I came off the pill because it messed with my head: low libido, depression, etc. Coming off it was the best thing I ever did. I'd see a doctor again and specifically ask them about other options you can try. |-| 
|-| cnvfqe4 || 35 || I think everyone hates having their body shamed. |-| 
|-| cnvfqlv || 6 || Yeah, any doctor that thinks you can just 'try harder' with your libido isn't very smart. I don't normally think doubting professionals is a good idea, but that mindset is as ignorant as thinking you can wish away your depression with enough gumption or whatever bullshit. |-| 
|-| cnvfxae || 18 || It's a pretty common theme.

There's been a recent theme in pop culture glorifying curvy femininity, which is fine, but it's accompanied by very explicit disdain for thin women, referring to them as sticks, skinny bitches, etc, as if being skinny makes any girl automatically catty or bitchy, and that boys prefer 'fuller' women compared to skinny counterparts.

It's hard to ignore. I'm sorry you've been feeling shamed. You don't deserve it. Love the skin you're in. |-| 
|-| cnvfzub || -4 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| cnvg0cv || 3 || Yes I know exactly what you mean! I thought I was fat my whole life. I always dreamed of being skinny like a model or celebrity, until I lost a significant amount of weight last year to the point where my collar bones/ribs stuck really far out. Everyone kept commenting on how skinny I was- asking if i eat, poking fun that I might float away.. and this was constant. At first it was really nice to hear how small I was instead of thinking that im a big fat cow, but after a while I was just so sick of everyone paying attention to my weight. It gets very frustrating to know that everyone is staring at you and basically hates you for being skinny. Im sick of hearing that I need a sandwich.... so yes i feel your pain!!!!

I think there is this image we create about the ideal female body that needs to be "slim, but curvy", setting an almost unrealistic standard, those who don't fit the norm are shamed. I don't know if this is of any comfort but some people are genuinely attracted to skinny bodies, myself included. |-|

And I try hard to gain weight but even that's difficult and being small like I am (less than 1 percentile of people my age) I get sick easier, suffer from multiple vitamin deficiencies, and have anemia, problems my PCP told me would be alleviated if I gained weight. Clothes shopping is also embarrassing since I'm a grown woman shopping at kids stores because nothing fits. But really, the design of children and adult clothes is obviously different, so it's hard to find nice clothes that I'd like.  |-|

|-| cnvhyjj || 19 || Recent Ranger School graduate here: I'm pretty confident that at least some of these women are going to pass no-problem. Once you get past the first week, it's an almost 100% mental school. Mountain Phase sucks because your ruck will peak upwards of 100lbs, but I've seen some pretty high-speed women in my time and can name a few that would make it.

I can say that Ranger in general is ready for females, but Darby Phase (the first 3 weeks) is DEFINITELY not on board. Their commander stresses that Ranger is a "small unit tactics" school as sort of a back-handed way to say slots on women are wasted because they can't go combat arms anyway, but both Mountains and Florida embrace the school as leadership-focused-- any branch can benefit from tabbed leaders.

I don't buy into any of the superficial critiques of women in Ranger, or the Infantry for that matter, but will say this: the interest might simply not be there for justify what upfront costs the Army does have to pay. This survey group of 60 was drawn from the entire Army, so finding enough willing and able women for the 10 classes a year might be a problem. Regardless, I'll still wear my tab no matter what the doubters say. |-| 
|-| cnvhz4k || 3 || Looks like people are downvoting you for being skinny lol. I get made fun of for being short a lot, and I never really felt short before it got worse. It sucks, but at the end of the day it's all about how you feel, not how others feel about you.  |-| 
|-| cnvi1cu || 12 || What you need to do is turn "what he knows" on it's head.  I know you feel as though it will work against you, but you really need to report this.

Don't let them make unfounded claims.

|-| cnvitfw || 35 || You've just described the abusive relationship I left a little over a year ago. Exactly.

One thing I've learned since I left is it's okay to feel sad for them. It's okay to feel sad about the loss of what you'd hope this would be. But you MUST accept that it isn't that. You were wrong. And that's okay. I held on for a LOOOOOONG time with my ex because I didn't want to be wrong. Within months of us getting together, he had already caused me friendships. People in my life didn't like him right away. Almost everyone I knew told me he wasn't good news, but I loved him SO much. I defended him. I let him convince me that everyone else was wrong and he was right. Just admitting "I was wrong" is so powerful. Because you know what? It's okay to be wrong. Everyone is wrong sometimes. What's not okay is systematically abusing another human until you destroy them at their very core. And that's what my relationship with my ex did to me.

The best thing you can do is continue your work in therapy and know that he will never, ever change. At least not until he goes to therapy and does serious work on himself ... But I still kind of doubt these types will ever do that. I left my ex for the final time after he went into a drug and alcohol fueled rage against me... guess why? I DIDN'T ANSWER HIS TEXTS QUICK ENOUGH one day. And what was I doing that day? Visiting family and spending time with my baby nephew. And he knew that. Yet he still went into a psychotic, mean, abusive rant against me because he wasn't my number-one priority for a few hours. And do you know what he tells people now about the reasons we broke up? "We just drifted apart... It was no one's fault." The fact that he can't even take responsibility for his drug abuse and rage issues says it all. He'll never change. He's got a new girlfriend now and I imagine it's only a matter of time before the poor thing experiences this too. 

You can love a monster because YOU have an incredible ability to love. Don't you ever feel bad about that. He's the monster, you're a good person. I'm glad you got out, and good luck. :) |-| 
|-| cnviwmi || 3 || I'm sorry about your mom. You will be sharing her legacy for years to come. Maybe you'll have kids one day and you can tell them stories about their wonderful grandmother, who they never got to meet. Are you close to your brother at all? Or maybe did your mom have close girlfriends that you could talk to? My mom died 2.5 years ago, sometimes I talk to her friend on the phone and we cry together and tell stories about her. It's cool because some of the stories were new to me, I get to see her in a new light.

Try not to feel guilty about your argument, that's totally normal mother daughter stuff and she knew how much you loved her.  |-| 
|-| cnvjf3w || 3 || I hear that chemo is the worst.  That it sucks the life out of you.  The fact that your aunt finds the strength not only for herself but to be an element of support in your life speaks so greatly the strength of her character.  I wish the best of recovery for the both of you. |-| 
|-| cnvjgxg || 7 || You're right that you shouldn't necessarily care what others think, however that doesn't mean you shouldn't ask for advice (that's not necessarily the same thing).

As far as the "degrading" thing, it seems to me that's entirely YOUR prerogative...not theirs, and not his.  Whether he feels like he's degrading you is relatively irrelevant, as long as you don't feel he is.

However, I personally think that all FWB situations are fraught with problems that can very easily take a good situation and turn it into a very bad one.  We're all human, we all have our petty jealousies and such, and we're never as logical and clear-thinking as we THINK we'll be...well, in pretty much any situation.  &lt;smile&gt;

Seinfeld had a great episode that I think shows a lot of what I'm trying to get at.

But above all else, it essentially boils down to what you (and he) thinks is best.  That's truly all that matters.
 |-| 
|-| cnvjjgw || 5 || Consent should be verbal initially but as relationships evolve, it can become nonverbal.  Still, in LTR's, consent is also about saying no or I'm uncomfortable at anytime during sex and your partner respecting those wishes. |-| 
|-| cnvjn63 || 6 || I'm a 23yo healthy male. I should be humping anything that moves. Ive had sex once when I was 19 and I hardly remember it (thanks alcohol). I went two more years than this kid before I lost my v-card and I managed to stab 0 women. I must be quite the gentleman. |-| 
|-| cnvk11s || 3 || Yeah, sadly we've just replaced one beauty standard with another. No real progress on actually accepting variety while still promoting actual good health. |-| 
|-| cnvk56t || 11 || What people fail to realize is that it isn't about being strong enough to get through ITB, or Ranger School, it's after these schools, Fleet, Deployments, Field ops.  It's about the unit and would there be any benefit to bringing Females into the Infantry, and 
	like it or not there isn't.  There is nothing that a women can bring to an Infantry unit that would benefit the cohesion of the platoon or squad, the only thing it would bring would be stress and drama.
	In combat we don't have the luxury of being comfortable or politically correct, the sexual harassment alone would offset the limited benefits that women might bring.  During my deployments I rarely took a shower and when I did it was with a bottle of water and baby wipes, when we went on dwell ops we would shit in a plastic bag and burn it, otherwise it was in a burn barrel with no doors.
	So women need to get over this feministic shit about being equal, because you aren't.  If women are so able bodied and strong to deal with the punishment and stress, why don't they fight in the UFC against the men?  As for the "women are already in combat", flying a A-10 or Cobra is not the same as walking 10 miles actively looking for people to kill, females bodies cannot handle it.

	 |-| 
|-| cnvk61l || 3 || Unfortunately, while the person who may become a victim has all the power to end or limit sexual activity (theoretically!) the onus is also on them to respond as such -- because the law is designed such that it must be a case that a reasonable person should be able to realise that consent was not given or was withdrawn.

I had a law class in which we were visited by a lawyer of a large city's SVU legal department. She told us about a certain case. For anyone reading, keep in mind that my memory is fuzzy, and perhaps I might fuck up the details that determined the case. Regardless this is a possible scenario.

In this a woman went back home with a guy -- they were both drunk -- and was prepared for a certain level of physical affection -- not intercourse. Yet there was intercourse. She contemplates leaving -- feeling violated -- but stays, because she felt unsafe being outside in the neighborhood late at night. He saw her next to him when he had woken up the morning after, and asked, I think, about getting breakfast. Something benign -- he seemed to not know how she felt about the act. She left, clearly upset.

She makes a report. When the woman called the guy with the police listening in (in order to get a confession), it was obvious that they were not on the same page. Eventually she confronts him more (the conversation had been benign / unhelpful) by expressing that she didn't want the sex. He -- and before this there was no proof -- says they thought they were being kinky, as she would say no, but then initiate again (remember, she wanted some level of action, but not sex!).  He is apparently overcome with sadness (like "Oh my god, I didn't realise") and comes to the police department and does a formal confession.

She ended up having PTSD, iirc.

There are also other cases, like those in abusive situations. Take Alston v. State. Essentially someone was being abused, physically and (probably) verbally. She breaks things off with her abuser (arguably; the text I read never was explicit about it, but it read to me as abuse), but he wants to do it one last time before they part. He brings her to a friend's house. Time elapses before they actually get to do it -- enough that the court is puzzled that she never tries to leave. But she's either resigned, or afraid of being subjected to violence (as she has been before, though she wasn't threatened to have sex that time specifically), because she doesn't leave. In the end the lack of resistance (especially physical, which people unfairly weighed at the time) means that, after an appeal, he doesn't serve the time he was supposed to. 

Edit: It's also worth noting that she tells him she doesn't want it -- which is what I mean by unfairly weighing physical resistance, and which fits into half of the point that I tried to make -- which is that consent (in this case, implied consent) can be a heavy responsibility for the victim. She was "supposed" to do more than just say no. I was unsure if my point was clear. |-| 
|-| cnvk6pt || 3 || Congrats!! I'm in kind of the same boat that you were, and you've inspired me to make another push to break into my field. |-| 
|-| cnvkiqu || 4 || Who says, "no, I would not prefer an egalitarian relationship"? |-| 
|-| cnvkiw2 || 11 || If you really care about your daughter being alone with him, you need to file a report and do it now.  

If there is a problem later and he wants more custody or full custody, what are you going to be able to say that will show this is a really bad idea? If you don't report what happened to you? Nothing.

You also need to to think about going to the hospital, or call whatever clinic is in your area, and seeing what antibiotics they can give you that will help prevent you catching whatever he may be carrying.  There is only a small window of effectiveness.  
 |-| 
|-| cnvkuu7 || 14 || First, kudos for getting away from your abuser. I was with mine for 11 years. I did not think I was being abused. He never hit me....not once. 

I finally got the courage to leave, and at that point I still didn't realize I was in an abusive relationship.  His favorite phrase whenever I "complained" was "you don't realize how good you have it, I don't hit you or cheat on you.....!go ahead and leave, you'll see real quick how good I am"

He was right...he never hit me nor cheated on me.  But he did verbally and emotionally abuse me. He did have a shot gun pointed at my head. He didn't work for four years because "if you made me feel wanted, I'd get a job" 

I could go on for days about this...but that's not my point. My point is this: you are not alone. Though there are no physical scars, that doesn't mean your hurt isn't real. You are brave for getting out. It's normal to miss them, but it does fade with time. 

You are not defective for how you feel. You are actually normal. It takes time and support to get past it. Join a gym, go do things you want to do. There's no one to stop you now. Write. Read. Go to the movies. You are FREE!  |-| 
|-| cnvkwb6 || 4 || I'm sorry this happened to you. Would you ever feel comfortable filling out a police report but not pressing charges? I know that it can be difficult to even verbalize to the cops or write down what happened to you, but it would still allow you to legally document the abuse. If there ever was a custody battle years from now, this could potentially be something you could use. It just keeps your options open and the cops could also possibly put you in touch with a domestic violence counselor. Hospital Emergency Departments are another option. There always has to be an ER doc on staff who deals with rape cases and social workers are usually pretty good at pointing you in the right direction. Seems like all this could happen without Jason even knowing... |-| 
|-| cnvl24s || 4 || Man that's some dark shit even if he did have sex he'd prolly still kill someone that guy was a ticking your bomb  |-| 
|-| cnvltye || 8 || You need to understand that someone who is okay to cross boundaries like raping someone doesnt have the mentality for making the best decisions in other circumstances (I dont think all rapists are child abusers, but I wouldnt put it past them.)

For the sake of your daughter, you need to contact the police. He is going to be in your life constantly if you dont have him arrested for what he did to you. You did nothing wrong. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

Please, coming from some random person who knows nothing about who you are, I want you to feel safe. I want you and your beautiful girls to live your lives fear free. If that means have one of the fathers arrested and charged for being a rapist, you need to make that step.

There will always be morons who want to blame you for what happened. MORONS, they're everywhere. If the courts do nothing, go to the media. You need to protect yourself. Get a restraining order and get him thrown in jail. He's a danger to society and quite possibly to your daughters. |-| 
|-| cnvluu1 || 3 || &gt; Protection is another subject. Protection should be agreed on by both parties. Especially if they have never had sex before. If one person wants protection, but the other person disregards this and doesn't use protection, this is a form of assault. 

Does that apply if the woman claims to be on the pill but isn't? Or if the woman surreptitiously pokes a hole in a condom? |-| 
|-| cnvlvtf || 3 || As someone who is also struggling to find a job in my chosen field, I know how big this is. Congratulations, and good luck! |-| 
|-| cnvmfi7 || 8 || First of all, good for you for getting away. That takes courage but it's the most critical step.

"I love the person he is when he isn't hurting me" is one of the most wrenching sentiments in these situations. And a lot of women have been there. Every time I got hung up on it I asked myself what my future would have been like with him. Always walking on eggshells, always trying not to provoke, then inevitably tripping up and doing something wrong to set him off anyway. That's what I could look forward to. And treasuring his good side just couldn't outweigh dreading his bad side. I was intensely aware, every minute, that all the reasons I fell in love with him were still there. But they were packaged up with somebody I could never be happy with. So I had to let him go. |-|

|-| cnvnwdp || 4 || Don't try to make it work, it's a lost cause.

What you see is passive-aggressiveness. He doesn't hit you because he's raised to not hit people. Because he can't hit you, he finds other ways. Unfortunately, this is common human behavior. Hitting you he signals bad views about him to everyone around him. He hits his partner, he's violent and a brute.

So if hitting is out of the table, what can he do to channel his whatever feeling which brings this kind of behavior? Berating, insulting, shaming, anything. Anything which isn't direct physical violence like in the DV ads. Assholes find a way no matter what. If you tell them insulting your partner is a crime and they still find a way to bring you down. It's human nature in it's worst and it can affect anyone. 

He won't stop. Maybe by miracle he can be get better, but in real life it's not a feasible option. Still having feelings for one you loved but had to let go is normal. I don't have real solution to such problem as I don't know you. These things are often too personal. I had such problems for a long time myself and it didn't get better until I had same feelings for another person, a better person. A horrible answer, that you should suffer until you find another, but I can't myself give any better advice. 

You do have to do something about it. Relationship takes two, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't stop being you. Think and make the decision what's best for you. |-|

|-| cnvomcn || 4 || I think about my abusive ex all the time. I want to drive to his house and talk to him, it's a crazy urge that reoccurs constantly. When I'm not wanting to be with him, I'm the polar opposite and I am disgusted with myself for wanting the love and intimacy of someone who called me a vapid semen recepticle.    
Trust that your brain has no interest in your wellbeing, and is merely soaked with high emotions whenever you think of him. It's not logical or fateful. It's a surge of hormones, fear, loss, anxiety, pity and love.      
I try to tell myself that I deserve to wait until I meet someone who truly loves me and doesn't manipulate my emotions. My love for him was real, but he hated himself so deeply, and had such mistrust for women and people altogether that it was destroying me to be there for him.  I was losing myself and desperately trying to prove to a monster that he could trust me. Finally I realized it was him who could not be trusted, that's why he thought I would cheat and accused me of lying.     
 His love was broken, and I started to blame myself when it was never my fault! I went from a happy smart girl into a shaking mess who constantly feared my random actions or words would be construed as proof of me cheating, despite me being completely committed to this one man.     |-|

|-| cnvoo67 || 247 || This sounds cool, but I wish most businesses/public places would have even a functioning tampon/pad dispenser. The one at my gym hasn't worked for over a year. I tried to use it last week, and it ate my money. I went outside and complained at the front desk, and they just blew me off. I went back to try mashing the button again, and it started to spit out quarters. Like, $5 worth of quarters. Of course, as soon as I mentioned that to the lady at the desk, she suddenly cared and sent someone to look at it. Pretty fucked up.

 I feel like making these available in some form should be required, as a basic form of hygiene, even if they have to charge for it. It's incredibly uncomfortable, humiliating, and upsetting (on top of regular PMS symptoms) to be stuck somewhere without any feminine products. |-| 
|-| cnvoqzh || 3 || I would love seeing these in bathrooms out and about. |-| 
|-| cnvow9a || 3 || &gt;I think consent is easy to obtain and should always be obtained before sex.

How so.  Like pull out some legal paperwork and do some mental checks to ensure everyone is of sound mind?  The problem is this never happens in reality.  Most sex involves implied consent based only on behavior and sometimes words, but never words that would be clear indicators of consent with a sound mind.  If anything, trying to force consent with a sound mind to be obtained will 'ruin the moment' and thus mean that those who try to be clear on consent will end up getting nos while those who don't will end up having sex.

Now, the current way of doing it has some major problems.  What happens if one party isn't fully capable of reading the other and the other may be too scared or uncertain to speak up?  What about the ones who know they can't read social situations and thus avoid them altogether.

We need a better system, but everything I've seen suggested is at best equal and most often worse than current. |-| 
|-| cnvpdpj || -11 || I'm sorry but I disagree.   If you have discomfort during or after urination,  you need to talk to your doctor.  A vending machine can't diagnose you.   A vending machine can't give you antibiotics.  Or run additional tests.  Or consider other symptoms.  This is even worse than people who use Google instead of see a doctor. |-|

|-| cnvpw0n || 4 || I was in an abusive relationship for 8 years. He was my first real love. It took my parents forcing me to move out of state and away from him for me to realize just how incredibly unhealthy his and my relationship had become. 

For almost six months he tried to get me back, and I kept having to force myself to ignore his calls and tear-filled voicemails. To remind myself that he was only manipulating me again. And in honesty one of the most healing things I did for myself was cry. I really and truly cried from the very depth of my soul. I cried for myself. I cried for years lost. I cried for him, and how horrible his life must be to be trapped inside of such a horrible person. 

I didn't hold back the emotions I felt and I let them ravage their way through my body. It hurt. I felt even less human than I did with him for a little while. But eventually once you get that all out, or at least once I did, I was able to step back and only pity him.

I hope with all of my being that someday he can find someone who he's truly happy with. Someone that he can truly love and respect. I don't wish ill on him, I only wish good. I just also want him to be far away from me. 


I've found myself a husband who gives everything to me the way I gave everything to my abuser, and I can give my husband a million times more love than I even realized was possible with my ex. 

It is possible to heal, but it takes time and the acceptance and belief that you deserve better than someone who causes you pain in so many ways. Good luck :) |-| 
|-| cnvpxa6 || 44 || If only testing for hpv and syphilis were as easy as peeing on a stick. Hpv can only be detected through Pap smear, which is why you need them every three years, ladies (more frequently if you've had an abnormal pap) and the test for syphilis is still a blood draw, I believe. 

HIV is also a blood test or a mouth swab, not a pee stick. So that ones out too. 

Chlamydia and gonorrhea is a pee test, but the urine has to be analyzed by a device that looks for the infection, it's not like a pregnancy test where a line appears. 

But if it were available, it would be awesome!  |-| 
|-| cnvq1vp || 3 || &gt;I think consent is easy to obtain and should always be obtained before sex

Okay. What limitations do you believe in? Does voluntary intoxication, but not to the point of being entirely incapacitated render someone unable to give operative consent? Where's that line?

If so, how do you objectively demonstrate that after the fact? She didn't say "yes I want to have sex", but did help undress herself and never said "no" or "stop"? Still consensual?

What if she claims she was interested in fooling around, but did not intend to have sex and failed to explicitly say "no" out of discomfort or fear?

 |-| 
|-| cnvq4j3 || 846 || Hello ladies! I was taking a shower when my fiance ran into the bathroom to tell me this was on Reddit. I'm so excited to see your comments and feedback (positive AND negative) on the Lady Business Vending concept.

This idea was my master's thesis in graduate school and so many women told me they liked it, so I tried to start it up. I founded Lady Business LLC (see http://ladybusinessvending.com/) to supply vending services for women in Boston. I approached schools, gyms, nail salons and attended night classes in women's entrepreneurship and business planning. I even purchased and imported two slim, wall-mounted vending machines to use as proof of concept. But in the end, I couldn't seem to get interest from institutions and facility managers. 

After two years of trying, I decided to put the idea aside and keep moving forward to be open to new experiences. But the idea is there, and if you have any influence in your own workplace, school, or business, I encourage you to ask for feminine vending machines that WORK and for them to provide a wider array of products.

The product line you see in the website is a concept -- designed to give people something to react to -- which you did! This is awesome. I encourage us to challenge the "norms" around self-diagnosis, treatment and access to care and break down "gatekeepers" when self-service makes more sense.

Thanks for your support and comments!

|-| cnvrbl5 || -4 || Sorry to burst the bubble of hope, but this is pretty unrealistic. Great concept, sure, but the technology is not available to do this. Just from a glance, HIV and Syphilis are not pee-test friendly diseases. There's probably plenty of other tests in there that are currently not feasible at the moment either. As a side note, I don't know why this should be orientated around women.. It would be better to market as a 'healthy check up' vending machine that is unisex, that is marketed at both genders. No reason for only women to be making sure that diseases aren't spread.. why push 50% of the available market out of the picture by advertising it as something for women? Seems not only irresponsible in a business sense, but sexist in an ethical one. |-| 
|-| cnvrfaa || 11 || I know it hurts and I know it gets old, the only thing you want to do is be normal, not trans but just a girl, not the trans girl. I'm sorry that people around you don't have tact. Think of children and their questions, there is no filter, just questions and amazement. I lose sight of this because I know so many trans people, but most people don't know any trans persons. So the questions come tumbling out of their mouths the way they would from a child's. The best thing to do is show or tell the person that is being innapropriate what they are doing wrong and correct them. You may be the first trans person they have ever met and you have the ability to make sure they never ask such personal and possibly triggering questions again. You can be the person who educates them about trans people and how to behave next time when the subject comes up. Keep your chin up, transgender people are becoming mainstream but lots of work still has to be done, a lot of people still need to be educated on how to treat trans people. The more people you reach the more opinions you change. 

I am cis but I've worked with the trans community for years, I had a lot of learning to do in the beginning. I was lucky, I've had some amazing women in my life who were incredibly patient with me and have taught me so much, most people don't have a special trans person in their life, you can be that person. 
 
Lots of love,

An Ally and advocate.

|-| cnvsbdq || 8 || I wanna start this off by saying I am not too familiar with the whole Trans community and it really confuses me to be honest. But what I got from your story is that you hung out with some down right rude people who need to check their manners and general social behavior. Your story reminded me of my sister in law, she cross dresses as a man occasionally and I have gotten to watch her interact with people as both a lesbian and a man. She uses these situations like an educational opportunity, she will direct the conversation in a way that she can answer the appropriate questions while maintaining a level she is comfortable with. But if it gets too vulgar or stupid she will cut it off at the bud, you have that right to speak up and not tolerate such poor behaviors. Just keep in mind to most people you are an oddity and they will be curious and will have a lot of questions. It's your job to lay down the ground rules, you are not some tour guide to the trans community and will not answer personal questions if you are uncomfortable with them. 

I'm not good at getting my ideas across on paper so I'm sorry if this makes no sense. I just saw an opportunity to maybe help out. |-| 
|-| cnvscgi || 23 || Fun idea, but:

- The price points for FMCGs are very tight. The premium for buying something like this from a machine will swing a person's decision a lot of the time. How often will the situation be that someone would pay the premium to have something from one of these boxes now, rather than pass by a general store/pharmacy later on?
- Expirables in vending machines are generally a bad idea. Low traffic means discarding products or selling potentially defective/degraded medical products to people, meaning massive lawsuit liability. The logistics of restocking are massively complicated by having various products all going off at different times.
- Medical items from dispensers may be against regulations.
- STD testing is a heavily licensed and regulated service.
- "Package deal" products tend to be unattractive - people would rather buy the individual product they actually need, paying a premium to avoid paying for the ones they don't. 
- Many of these products are embarrassing to buy and people may not want to use them if they were in a public place.

I have seen hotels stocking marked up tampons in the same machine as things like toothpaste, though. Have also seen expensive condom dispensers.  |-| 
|-| cnvsujv || 3 || How accurate would a lot of those tests be, though?  What about the risk of false positives, or false negatives?  Isn't plan B potentially dangerous for the user?

Still, really damned awesome idea. |-| 
|-| cnvsyh0 || 5 || I feel like this wouldn't work as is. Not only are some of these things not feasible, but some of the combinations are problematic. For example, why would you need Plan B and a pregnancy test at the same time? If the Plan B works and you get your period, you don't need the test at all. If you need the test now, plan B won't be affective. 

That being said, some of these things would be nice to be able to access immediately and semi-privately. Being able to buy and take a pregnancy test in a bathroom, on the spot, would be helpful for people who don't want anyone to find out they're taking a test, especially if the machine was located in a single occupancy bathroom.

Being able to purchase Plan B from a machine would be especially great, since the sooner you take it, the more effective it is. Also, the same privacy concerns apply, so that would be nice as well. |-|

If I told people that I was taking drugs to make my dick bigger because I felt that I wasn't born with the dick I should have had, I would not be surprised if people asked me how big it was to begin with, or if it still worked after taking the drugs, or etc.   I've seen women talk about getting breast implants or breast reduction surgery, and yes, everyone starts asking them questions about their breasts once they've brought it up.

If you tell people something about yourself, they will be curious about issues relating to it and will ask questions to make conversation. It may be impolite, but it's not a non-sequitur like your examples would imply. |-|

in high school.

I was always enrolled in sports as a child, and performed well in P.E. classes - one of the fastest runners, a very fast sprinter with a long stride, etc.

But every time I had a game on my period, I would really "let the team down"... not keeping up with my check, lagging while running, my shots and passes not being straight, and so on. Then after the game, I felt like passing out from the intense cramping that built up from trying to push through my period pain...  |-|

You can't afford to pay to go on dates, you don't want your date to pay for you and you don't want to go on free dates. This alone means that you shouldn't be dating, because what would you do?

 |-| 
|-| cnx5kmx || -3 || I think this might be a waste of money - if both parties already agree on paying child support no matter the result, there is no need to pay for a DNA test. I understand where they're coming from, though - men should have the right to require a test. |-| 
|-| cnx5lyt || 4 || Just remember that you have the rest of your life to find people to start relationships with. I think you should focus on yourself and your mental health before you add something as complex as a relationship into the mix! YOU are the most important, and in a relationship it becomes harder to focus on your emotional stability since you're also worrying about somebody elses.

As an alternative, maybe you could join a site like ok cupid specifically asking for friendships. Maybe you'll meet a guy who is happy just chatting, getting to know each other, and when you both feel comfortable and safe and know that he's safe to be with, you could slowly ease into something a little bit more. |-|

|-| cnx6435 || 47 || I support this entirely, if only because I've known mothers who extort child support money out of men who didn't father their children. It's unethical and fraudulent and measures should be put into place to prevent that sort of thing. It's sometimes difficult for these men to argue their case because others often take up the opinion that they only want the test because they don't want to be responsible for the child. 

Of course, a complication arises in cases of adoption and stepchildren. If a couple is divorced with children and one parent (child support is NOT a men-only phenomenon) is required to pay child support, would this bill exclude that financial responsibility for the sole reason of no blood relation? |-| 
|-| cnx66g1 || 16 || Man here - trimming is different from shaving. Men are expected to trim the bush too. It's just about keeping things tidy. Sort of like a hair cut or trimming a beard. It just looks neater. |-| 
|-| cnx68e3 || 24 || Well, the idea that all women should shave their armpits isn't that old either.

My grandmother has never shaved her legs - it just wasn't the norm. 

But there are plenty of points in history or different cultures that see it the same way. Look at Greek/Roman statues or classical paintings (which fuelled the whole Ruskin thing). A Muslim friend told me that it's the norm for them to be totally shaved too.

But as far as our own western culture, I reckon it's been like this for over a decade. I started shaving as soon as it started growing (well before I'd ever seen any porn or knew it was a thing) and now feel horrible (itchy and unclean) if I don't. I think that once you do it, it's difficult to stop. That may be part of the reason for 'the horror' rather than what other people think about it.  |-| 
|-| cnx691h || 5 || I don't care about when I go to the doctor...they've seen it all, so I'm not going to worry about it. :)

My boyfriend doesn't have a preference and I don't like body hair in general, so I get regular Brazilian waxes.  If I could do some sort of permanent hair removal on everything except the hair on my head and around my eyes I'd be one happy camper! |-| 
|-| cnx6fad || 48 || I'm strangely impressed that a woman who is 2 weeks off popping is even aware of her pubic hair, never mind that she's trimming it.  How does she reach? |-| 
|-| cnx6fog || 5 || I don't necessarily agree with the idea of making it mandatory, especially since as far as I could tell, the bill doesn't establish who is going to pay for the DNA test. If they decide to make the woman pay for it (which wouldn't surprise me, because Mississippi), this could certainly become a mechanism for making the process so expensive/complicated/time consuming that the woman cant afford to go through with it. If the state is paying for it, I have way less of an issue.    

It probably should have been written as something like "If the father disputes paternity, paternity may be required to be established by
DNA blood tests before child support can be ordered." |-|

|-| cnx80w5 || -5 || *Both* would-be parents should be tested.

But what happens in the case of an adopted child? Or a child conceived via a donor egg or donor sperm?

The law has no provisions for adoption or donor egg/sperm. If this law passed, egg and sperm donors would be on the hook for child support, and adopted children would either be sent to orphanariums in the case of dead biological parents, or their biological parents would be on the hook. |-| 
|-| cnx84yl || 8 || This would be an excellent precedent to get on the books. A paternity test isn't that expensive to toss into medical bills for a pregnancy and associated court costs of a divorce/ custody dispute. There have been too many cases where an eventual forced test shows it wasn't his kid but he his forced to continue paying because the court decided it was his responsibility. Much like regulations and taxes, once it's put in place, it is extremely hard to get rid of.  |-| 
|-| cnx85ng || -11 || In theory I have no issue with this, but like others, I'm curious about how it will be funded. 

There are a lot of problems with the system. Something like half of child support never gets paid. I wish people in this discussions wouldn't be so quick to lose focus on the entire point of child support, the needs of the *child*. The mother's bad decisions shouldn't hurt the kid. |-| 
|-| cnx87qe || 28 || As far as I see it only women who are cheaters would go against this. I think it is wonderful. Someone needs to look out for the men.  |-| 
|-| cnx8b8u || 126 || Having known women who cuckolded their husbands,  I think it's a great idea. Having known families that used sperm donation,  I think that they would have to get legal protection. 

Knowing that the emotional fallout on a child is terrible,  I think it's a much better idea to have the tests be mandatory at birth. That way everyone knows what they are getting into.  

 |-| 
|-| cnx8dxw || -15 || I think this is fair only in cases where paternity has not already been established prior to the custodial parent filing for support.

If a man has been supporting his legal children, and has accepted that responsibility, the children shouldn't lose support of a parent because their father accepted paternity without a DNA test.

Won't upgrade to it since it has fingerprint recognition as one of its main security features (call me paranoid, it's fine).

Conversely, if the declared father is not the biological father, will all this genetic information be available to identify him? This could create a whole new level of single mother dependent on state support, which is sad on so many different levels.

Also, as another user points out, I think it is the man that ought to be asked if he wants the paternity tested (why use resources if people really don't want the test?). I'm confident that many couples have complete faith in their partne. That being said, since the maternity is obvious, I don't feel like it's the mothers right to choose to get a paternity test. 

And, how if this enforceable? As much as it's the decent thing to do, not every potential father wants or is able to be present at the hospital for birth. Does the mother identify him on a mailed out sheet, and then he is mailed a kit? I want to clarify that I think this could be a great idea, but I see limitless what if's. |-| 
|-| cnx8wf4 || 6 || This is beautiful. |-| 
|-| cnx8xmk || 50 || I am a Mississippi family law attorney. As a practical matter, this is already policy. The state Deparment of Human Services, which handles the vast majority of paternity cases, already offers putative fathers the option for DNA testing every time. And in other paternity cases, I have never seen a judge deny a request for testing. 
Of course, this doesn't apply to situations like when a child is born to a marriage, where paternity is already established as a matter of law (unless a judge orders otherwise). And there is already a statute in place stating that for unwed fathers who have signed the birth certificate and acknowledged paternity, after one year or more has passed the court won't overturn that presumption except in cases of fraud. 
Overall the courts and legislature here have done a reasonably good job of balancing the common law principle that we always try to avoid "bastardizing" a child, and the advantages that the new science and technology give us regarding paternity.  |-| 
|-| cnx8y43 || 3 || I always shave because it makes oral sex feel way better, my fiance shaves as well for similar reasons. I've only grown them once in years because my fiance wanted to see if they were actually red like I claimed :-) so it's not like they horrify me but just make oral sex less pleasurable. 

As far as going to the doctor well I had a pap test a few weeks ago and was due for a shave that day. When I had a shower before I went I deliberately didn't shave though because I was embarrassed the doctor might think I made an effort to look nice for her when I actually don't give a shit if I show up hairy :-P  |-| 
|-| cnx90yn || 22 || I really don't understand how this author made the leap from "returning topless picture to page 3" to "[reveling] in the chance to make women with opinions look stupid."

|-| cnx9awk || 3 || well if the government orders something they should make sure with their fullest ability that it is correct.

some mother who is paying child support. and and later found out the kid was not hers.  would be able to sue the court for causeing financial hardship.  well ok maybe this only makes sense from the fathers perspective.  i have yet to hear many women deny the child is theirs. |-| 
|-| cnx9lgm || 33 || Honestly, I dont think for me it was porn influenced or anything, I always hated pubic hair from the day it started growing when I was 12 or whatever.  At that point I just didn't realize there was any other option so I left it, but I HATED it, I resented it, I felt like it was ugly.  I'd never seen porn or never knew women went bare, but when I started college and realized people shave it, I was like YES YES YES and I felt so sexy and clean and happy with that area for the first time in years.  So yes, I'd probably be like that pregnant woman because I hate any time I feel hair growing there and leaving it while Im pregnant wouldn't be an option since I just love it being clean down there. |-|

They certainly got everyone talking about them.  |-| 
|-| cnxam4h || 6 || I have two comments:

&gt;"Paternity must be established by DNA blood tests before child support can be ordered."

The emphasized text of the bill as quoted above seems to rest on a presumption that only mothers are requesting child support, notwithstanding the gender-neutral 'parent' language used throughout the bill.  Placing on a father seeking child support from a mother the obligation to obtain a paternity test documenting his parenthood of the children he's affirmatively supporting seems problematic to me.

Secondly, I would be more comfortable with it if the party charged with support (either gender) could waive the requirement for the test and simply stipulate to paternity.  

While I see here that some men are very vocal about their fears of cuckolding (and my god I cannot say that ridiculous word with a straight face, sorry boys), I know many more men in the real world who are devoted to kids whether biologically theirs or not, and who could use legal support and protection in their parenting.  

In a sense, the presumption that support is a female entitlement reflects negative gender stereotypes that inflict harm on BOTH men and women.

|-| cnxay9q || 22 || &gt;Edit: Ok, I know this was a stupid question and that I'm am idiot for even posting this. 

Hey, you're not an idiot. You're someone who wants to be loved and to love. There's nothing wrong with that. I think that it's a good start that you are thinking about your circumstances and assessing your readiness.

&gt;So I've really been feeling down that at my age I've never had a boyfriend [...]


&gt;[...] it's just been eating me up inside that a woman my age had never had an actual boyfriend

However, I am concerned a bit that you are more fixated on the milestone/achievement of having a boyfriend than you are about finding the right person.

Would it make you feel better to know that I'm a 29 year old ciswoman that only recently entered into my first-ever relationship? In that respect, you actually have a head start on me. Instead of worrying about something as inconsequential as your age, worry about being the best possible person that you can be. Be patient and gentle with yourself. Set yourself a variety of goals, long- and short-term. You might fail sometimes, but that's okay. Everyone who's ever done anything worthwhile has failed at some point. Do what you need to, and work on things as they come so you're not overwhelmed. You have plenty of time. |-| 
|-| cnxb1mi || 26 || Consider cross-posting to /r/askhistorians if you want an actual answer. |-| 
|-| cnxb1xn || 3 || You are so hard on yourself! Throw some compassion your way because you NEED it right now. You're in a terribly vulnerable place! It's totally understandable why you'd feel so distraught since it is something you've likely felt painfully aware of for a very long time. 

If you're not already in therapy, I recommend talking these concerns out with a professional. There's something GORGEOUS about a woman who is unapologetically herself but it's extremely difficult to break the habits of beating yourself up without assistance. 

The closer you get to that self-assured demure confidence, the more your radiance will open you up to opportunities with the hotties. :) |-|

|-| cnxbftn || 20 || That's a good idea. If the men want to waive the right to a test, they can make that choice, but demanding a paternity test is only intelligent. Given that I have one friend (who was married, was being key here) whose wife gave birth to a black baby (they are both white as chalk, he has blue eye and red hair). Demanding paternity for child support is always a smart move. |-| 
|-| cnxbs72 || 3 || Hi, I'm a MS family law attorney. Here is the text of our most recent statute about disestablishment of paternity and DNA testing. I hope it clears up some of the questions in this thread.
Mississippi Statutes
Title 93. DOMESTIC RELATIONS
Chapter 9. BASTARDY
UNIFORM LAW ON PATERNITY
Current through 2014 Second Extraordinary Session
§ 93-9-9. Enforcement; attorney's fees and costs; surname of child; request for genetic testing by alleged father; tolling of one-year time limit to rescind voluntary acknowledgement of paternity

(1)	Paternity may be determined upon the petition of the mother, or father, the child or any public authority chargeable by law with the support of the child; provided that such an adjudication after the death of the defendant must be made only upon clear and convincing evidence. If paternity has been lawfully determined, or has been acknowledged in writing according to the laws of this state, the liabilities of the noncustodial parent may be enforced in the same or other proceedings by the custodial parent, the child, or any public authority which has furnished or may furnish the reasonable expenses of pregnancy, confinement, education, necessary support and maintenance, and medical or funeral expenses for the custodial parent or the child. The trier of fact shall receive without the need for third-party foundation testimony certified, attested or sworn documentation as evidence of (a) childbirth records; (b) cost of filing fees; (c) court costs; (d) services of process fees; (e) mailing cost; (f) genetic tests and testing fees; (g) the department's attorney's fees; (h) in cases where the state or any of its entities or divisions have provided medical services to the child or the child's mother, all costs of prenatal care, birthing, postnatal care and any other medical expenses incurred by the child or by the mother as a consequence of the mother's pregnancy or delivery; and (i) funeral expenses. All costs and fees shall be ordered paid to the Department of Human Services in all cases successfully prosecuted with a minimum of Two Hundred Fifty Dollars ($ 250.00) in attorney's fees or an amount determined by the court without submitting an affidavit. Proceedings may be instituted at any time until such child attains the age of twenty-one (21) years unless the child has been emancipated as provided in Section 93-5-23 and Section 93-11-65 . In the event of court-determined paternity, the surname of the child shall be that of the father, unless the judgment specifies otherwise.
(2)	If the alleged father in an action to determine paternity to which the Department of Human Services is a party fails to appear for a scheduled hearing after having been served with process or subsequent notice consistent with the Rules of Civil Procedure, his paternity of the child(ren) shall be established by the court if an affidavit sworn to by the mother averring the alleged father's paternity of the child has accompanied the complaint to determine paternity. Said affidavit shall constitute sufficient grounds for the court's finding of the alleged father's paternity without the necessity of the presence or testimony of the mother at the said hearing. The court shall, upon motion by the Department of Human Services, enter a judgment of paternity. Any person who shall willfully and knowingly file a false affidavit shall be subject to a fine of not more than One Thousand Dollars ($ 1,000.00).
(3)	Upon application of both parents to the State Board of Health and receipt by the State Board of Health of a sworn acknowledgement of paternity executed by both parents subsequent to the birth of a child born out of wedlock, the birth certificate of the child shall be amended to show such paternity if paternity is not shown on the birth certificate. Upon request of the parents for the legitimization of a child under this section, the surname of the child shall be changed on the certificate to that of the father.
(4)	
(a)	A signed voluntary acknowledgment of paternity is subject to the right of any signatory to rescind the acknowledgment within the earlier of:
(i)	One (1) year; or
(ii)	The date of a judicial proceeding relating to the child, including a proceeding to establish a support order, in which the signatory is a party.
(b)	After the expiration of the one-year period specified in subsection (4)(a)(i) of this section, a signed voluntary acknowledgment of paternity may be challenged in court only on the basis of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact, with the burden of proof upon the challenger; the legal responsibilities, including child support obligations, of any signatory arising from the acknowledgment may not be suspended during the pendency of the challenge, except for good cause shown.
(c)	During the one-year time period specified in subsection (4)(a)(i) of this section, the alleged father may request genetic testing through the Department of Human Services in accordance with the provisions of Section 93-9-21 .
(d)	The one-year time limit, specified in subsection (4)(a)(i) of this section, for the right of the alleged father to rescind the signed voluntary acknowledgement of paternity shall be tolled from the date the alleged father files his formal application for genetic testing with the Department of Human Services until the date the test results are revealed to the alleged father by the department. After the one-year time period has expired, not including any period of time tolled for the purpose of acquiring genetic testing through the department, the provisions of subsection (4)(b) of this section shall apply. |-| 
|-| cnxbtih || 4 || I'll play devils advocate here:

I would only be against this if costs for a paternity test were unreasonable, or if you could trap a parent into no child support by fleeing the area.

I could see a lot of people who know child support is coming, skedaddle rather than be forced to pay. 

Though I would assume the court could order someone to undergo a DNA test, but then could I just point at a random person and say "You are my baby daddy" and force them to undergo the procedure even though both parties know that I'm lying? 

Just for the inconvenience and possibly to hurt their relationships with loved ones. Will there be a penalty for False allegations or can someone be considered using this requirement maliciously, or abusively.

Other Concerns:

* Is the Mother Paying for it, or the Father, or is it a split cost?
* As this law stands ( I did not read the entire law ) could someone who was a sperm donor get loopholed into becoming payer. I assume there are contracts that void that requirement, but what if someone wants to test that in court because they think there is an opportunity.

I like this idea in principal, but I would need to see the limitations and regulation attached before I am confident that the law is ready to implement.

|-| cnxc7mc || 76 || I think it's a combination of things.  The UvA case, the Duke LaCrosse case, and Cosby himself was blackmailed some years ago by a woman who threatened to go public that he had fathered her child.  ISTR that turned out to be true, but still it's illegal for her to blackmail him, and she wouldn't have done it if he hadn't been rich.  But mostly, there's the notion that many people get of actually *knowing* the people they see on TV and in the movies.  Bill Cosby is a great Dad, we saw him being a great Dad on TV, great Dad's don't do this.

So, when there's one accuser, the "this could be a lie and she's just trying to get money from a rich guy" has to be in your head.  She's a stranger and he's your friend you've known for years.

The really sad part of all this is that more women didn't feel they could come forward years ago, probably exactly for the "I'm a stranger and everybody loves him" reason.  If they had felt that they could go to the police and get action years ago, later victims might have spared entirely.

|-| cnxdd0n || 9 || This is 70's feminists awareness but.. The more political power women attained, the more social pressure was imposed on them to become physically smaller. "Rubenesque" full figured women used to be the norm. This also applies to the blurring of the lines between women and girls by social pressure to remove the features of mature women's secondary sexual characteristics. Shaving and waxing is the newest practice but this started with make up to make mature women look child like and young girls look sexually mature. These pressures arise in direct proportion to women's social status improvements. All dysfunctional systems exert  "change back" pressures if any part of the system attempts to individuate and gain health and wholeness.  |-|

&gt;"I don't know why it's so hard to believe women. I mean, you go to Saudi Arabia and you need two women to testify against a man; here you need 25," he replied.

First, great point. Second, is it really written into law in Saudi Arabia that two women's testimony equals one man's? That's some serious sexism right there. And yet, again, back to his excellent point: some people in the U.S. - this thread evidence of it - still don't believe it when *twenty-five* people have accused this guy. I mean come on! None of them are getting money from this. Many of them explain how they tired to come forward sooner but the police laughed at them, or how their closest friends didn't believe them, or how they were just too scared that nobody would believe them to come forward at all. They all have similar stories about his rape methods. What more do you need!? You'll only believe a rape happened if you actually see it with your own eyes personally or something?? Naw, I think some people just don't believe women; that's what this is about. They're rape apologists or in denial of the reality that rapes happen. 

&gt;"He made a flat-out statement that reverberated around the world. If that was on TV, it would have been edited. If it were on any other medium, it would have been edited," Leno said.

&gt;"But because somebody just filmed it and put it out there, you're getting your news raw and unfiltered, which I think is fantastic."

Another great point on the power of the internet and social media!  |-|

That said, I think that when we're talking about celebrities, there's a larger issue of why we are skeptical about people making accusations against celebrities in a way we are not about other types of accusation.  

We absolutely know for a fact that there are crazy people out there who fixate on celebrities and create intricate delusions, we absolutely know that there are evil people out there who want to get rich or famous and are willing to lie about something like this to do it, we absolutely know that the media will warp and manipulate a narrative about celebrities in order to make a more sensational story.  Even if the crazy and evil people only represent 1 in 1 million of the general population, that's still hundreds that we'd expect to show up on the news, with the media supporting their narrative for better ratings.  You or I are unlikely to encounter them, which is why we shouldn't cast as much doubt on ordinary accusations against you or me; but celebrities will encounter them at a much higher rate, and that's why those accusation get treated with greater skepticism. |-|

|-| cnxg0zm || 63 || This is disgusting... Additionally, I had no idea that the States had "fetal homicide" laws. Wow. |-| 
|-| cnxg8pm || 29 || Here's my take on it: Paternity tests should be publicly funded or included in the overall hospital charge for having a baby, and they should be, for the most part, mandatory. I'm sure there are a bunch of special circumstances that would make the test bad, and so in crafting the legislation, there should be clauses to help with that, but doing it any other way causes too many other problems. To elaborate:

Waiting until the divorce and then doing the test leaves a lot of children suddenly vulnerable, particularly since when you add long stretches of time, it may become harder and harder to find the biological father.

Getting the test early can avoid a lot of emotional turmoil later on for both the parents and the child. Family ties aren't suddenly broken -- everyone knows what's up ahead of time.

Making them mandatory saves a lot of shit from hitting the fan. If you make them either optional or create a general purpose waiver, I imagine the expectations of trust in a relationship would ruin the effectiveness of these laws. Ladies, for those of you who are in what you see as a good relationship, don't you feel that if you had a baby with your SO, and he asked for a paternity test at birth (or didn't waive his automatic right to one), that at the very least, you'd feel like he didn't trust you, and the relationship would be irrevocably damaged? Obviously, not all of you feel that way, but I'd be willing to venture, that if you're honest with yourselves, many of you do. From this, you're going to get a lot of men that are socially pressured into not having the test, even if, in the end, they needed it.

Also, by making the tests generally mandatory, you can save deceived men from relationships where their SO is cuckolding them, but she's good enough of a liar that he's completely clueless, and trusts her, so he feels he's got no reason to order the test, or not to waive his right to one.

What it really comes down to is that we need to do this, but in a way that protects men, and minimizes the impact to children. |-| 
|-| cnxgibc || 51 || That is absolutely horrific. In addition to being awful for the reasons that I'm sure are obvious to most of us, it's extremely concerning because it makes me fear that women living in areas with laws like those will fail to seek out medical care during pregnancy, or won't go to the hospital when they're experiencing a serious or life-threatening pregnancy complication, for fear of being jailed. 

It also makes me very concerned about what happens to women in El Salvador who experience ectopic pregnancies or whose fetus has died but they have not successfully miscarried naturally, since these women may need surgeries that are similar to abortion procedures-- even if they desperately wanted to have a baby. Is any help available for these women? |-| 
|-| cnxglco || -10 || Here's the thing. While this particular case (ie cases with public figures and celebrities) is a bit different, in smaller cases you can and should be supporting both parties.  You should believe that it's **possible** the accuser was raped  and not treat them as a lier and offer support. At the same time you **should not** treat the accused as a rapist until proven to be such. These kind of cases should be treated differently because public opinian matters and can directly effect the accused (as its done). 

As for the number of witnesses,   I haven't found a single list were everyone are getting these outrageously high number of acusers that keep jumping around. I've seen in twox alone 12, 20, 34 I've even seen 50 throw out. If anyone has where any of these numbers are coming from I'll be thrilled. 

Not that the number matters 20 people are no more less likely to lie than one, so we still shouldn't be treating Cosby like a rapist until he's found in a court of law to be one. 

Quite honestly,  I'd say it's more likely that a person raped one or two people rather than 20. I can almost garuntee that Bill Cosby did not rape almost two dozen women.   |-|

The hypocrisy is overwhelming.  If this were a policy to ensure the financial freedom of women from men who had lied to and used them, the response would be different.  

I am for requiring the test, but the cost should simply be split by both the parents rather than taxpayers.  The argument that the government already spends so much money on stupid social issues so "why not this one too?" is a terrible argument.  If the father ends up being not in fact the father, then the mother should reimburse the father his portion of the payment.  Or (my preference) simply have the paternity test be mandatory at birth, and tack the expenses onto the cost of birth/post-birth care. |-|

Yes, because I only support an organization that provides affordable access to health care for millions of women because I thought I was going to have to get an abortion someday.

|-| cnxinno || 188 || Safe? Yes.  Legal? Yes.  Access?

.....Weeelll..."access" is a strong word.  

Still feels like a long way to go sometimes.  Keep up the good fight! |-| 
|-| cnxip39 || -8 || This is a legal matter though, I think we make a mockery of the justice system when we "take someone's word for it". Yes I am aware that statistics show false rape claims are rare. But remember that these are people's lives at stake, the only claim that should be believed is one substantiated by evidence. Until guilt can be proven through more than just one person's word against another, I personally would have a reasonable doubt as to convicting a person of a crime. I hope the rest of you feel the same.


EDIT: So apparently this is not technically a legal matter since the claims are old enough to be outside the statute of limitations. The sentiment of what I said still rings true though. A lot of women have come forward and said Cosby sexually assaulted them. In all probability most or all of the claims are true. So you're downvoting me why? Because you think we should base our stances on issues that affect someone's life and public image on mere probability? Because you disagree with one of the most basic aspects of our justice system? I know their testimony is a form of evidence, and I agree Cosby is very likely guilty of sexual assault. But I am trying to reserve judgment on either side without more compelling evidence.


I am on your side, I have great sympathy for any victim of sexual assault or violent crime in general. It's funny to me that people who have expressed similar views on this matter have been labeled as trolls, a very convenient way to dismiss any view that does not match your own. Way to support a reasonable discussion twoX.


Edit2: I think this issue has a lot more to do with a culture that is very unwelcoming to rape victims, had these claims only been made public sooner, the cause of justice would have been better served. It's a sad state of affairs all right, but violating one of the basic tenants of out justice system, innocent until proven guilty, I'm sure you will agree is very dangerous. If these claims were within the statute of limitations and could be substantiated by cold hard evidence, then I would be all for taking this man to task. Unfortunately this is not the case, regardless of whether I believe the claims of these women, I am not OK with having a justice system where you can see someone thrown in jail on the word of another alone. |-|

|-| cnxj0iu || 6 || While students have options for where to imbibe, from dorm parties to off-campus bars, fraternities have a disproportionate presence in campus social life, some students said, mostly because of the free-flowing alcohol.

“It’s what we know,” Ashley Alessandra, a freshman, said while walking to a Kappa Alpha fraternity party with three friends on Friday night. “We go to frats.”

The choice is there fraternities don't have a stranglehold on fun

 |-| 
|-| cnxj1tr || 20 || For all the people wondering why there is a booze-ban in sororities but not in fraternities, that's usually because sororities are normally run by an extensive house board of elders that make rules, decide how to spend their money, etc etc while many fraternities are run mostly by the guys living in the house. This obviously isn't the case for everyone, just the case for a lot of them. This gives the guys more freedom to throw parties whenever they want, because its easier to convince college guys to invite girls over to drink than it is to convince girl's mothers to let drunk frat guys come over to their "daughter's" house.  |-|

|-| cnxj420 || 10 || Many students attributed sororities’ alcohol ban to a persistent myth — that archaic local laws consider any home with more than four or five women with alcohol present to be a brothel. In fact, it has always resulted from the voluntary policy of each of the 26 sororities in theNational Panhellenic Conference to preserve more placid living environments with lower insurance premiums.

Voluntary ban, nodoby is saying there are laws against this i posted this cuz few comments didnt read this part. |-| 
|-| cnxj4mx || 6 || First of all I definitely do not think you're an idiot. And from reading the comments I don't think that anyone else does either.

It can be very therapeutic to put your words down, and share with others. Good for you for being brave enough to put this out there on the internet.

From what you said, it seems like you have some self esteem issues and perhaps social anxiety, along with your depression. This is totally normal. I still struggle with it on a day to day basis, there can be good days and bad.

I would take some time so you can learn to love yourself and your body before you put yourself out there. It can be hard to open yourself up to people, and in my experience, I act out when depressed which can put a massive strain on a relationship.

Also, there is nothing wrong with being single. :) |-|

I lowballed myself two years ago. I'm still trying to get the company I work for to come up to market value for my position and it's been brutal. The company was acquired shortly after I joined; Had I pressed on salary before that I probably would have gotten the raise, with it still being a small company that could make its own decisions. Now I live in the "real world", where companies think, "We've been paying her X for Y time, so she's worth X. Why would we pay her X+Z?"

Everyone that was hired after me was hired at fair market values. For the same position. With less experience than me. It makes my blood boil when I think about it. HR is working with me, and knows that if it isn't done in the next couple months, I'm moving on.

The advice I've gotten off the record from managers is that large increases in salary usually only happen when you change workplaces. |-|

Me and a friend did it once when we were in our early teens Cuz we thought it made us look like old babies and I just got used to it and haven't been able to let it grow again... 

Most people I know (male and female) either just leave it or keep it trimmed... Very few shave entirely and even fewer seem to care... To be honest sex happens in the dark most of the time and I doubt someone's going to refuse sex or a relationship after seeing that you have a bit of extra hair... |-|

In entering into the second interview, I'd address your concern near the end of the conversation. When they say if you have any more questions you can say something like:

"I understand that when we previously met I stated my salary expectations were around 45k and upon reviewing my cost of living and in order to achieve my personal goals I would like to get closer to 50K given that I'm missing some qualifications. However, I would totally understand if you're more comfortable starting me at 45k, and after my probationary period of 3 months I'd love to sit down and review my performance up to that point and if I've proven myself to be a good fit I'd love the opportunity to advance to 50k at that point"

Something along those lines. Do you have 3 month probationary periods? If not, give them a decent amount of time to request a review of your performance in which they can raise you if agreed upon.

Hope that helps// |-| 
|-| cnxki4h || 140 || You know what's really fucked up? For 42 years women dying from self inflicted and back alley abortions has been absent from the news because of Roe v Wade. Here come these new activists who never had to live in that world, trying to hit the reset button so that women will have to die all over again to prove to these assholes that women will die without safe, legal abortion. 

  |-| 
|-| cnxkn0h || 113 || I've rarely seen a higher concentration of misunderstanding of due process and the concept of innocence until proven guilty.  The government can't, and shouldn't, punish someone until/unless he or she has been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.  If they try, or if they suspend that standard, I'd happily defend any scumbag with all my power.

If people went after that scumbag's money, though, they would only have to prove that he was more likely than not responsible for the attacks to get paid.  And success at even that wouldn't affect his innocence until proof of guilt, because criminal charges would require a separate trial with its higher burden of proof.  

But for any type or level of societal sanction, including ridicule and public shaming, there's no evidentiary requirement at all, as it should be in a free society.  (Except for opening oneself to a defamation lawsuit by deliberately lying about a public figure, obviously.)

I don't need Karl Rove to be convicted to say that I think he rigged elections.  I don't need Nathan Deal to be convicted to say that I think he's a bribe-taking, unethical trash governor.  And I certainly don't need Bill Cosby to be convicted to say that I think he's a rapist scumbag based on personal accounts of many victims.

Innocence until proof of guilt is one of the most important hallmarks of our justice system.  It's also completely irrelevant to this discussion. |-|

|-| cnxlkzh || 5 || The issue here is if we are going to take the right of every human to pass their genetic material to the next generation as that, a right. Having a kid is expensive, in many cases it's impossible to support more than two or three. Every kid a man is deceived into supporting is a less kid he will have. On the other hand, kids need money to live. I'm not as concerned about how the tests would be payed as where the fatherless kids would get their food and education from. I have no answer for that. 

Some troll in this thread has mentioned that raising a kid that isn't yours is like an adoption, and I agree. But it's an adoption agreed under false pretenses, so it should be discarded as soon the misinformation is discovered. This is just a justice issue, not more than that, but the societal cost can be staggering. 

So either we tolerate legalized fraud (basically financial slavery) or we face a 4% increase of kids in heavy risk of social exclusion. This is a complicated one... |-|

Firstly, the house will get messy. I'm not talking a few cups here and there. There will be vomit and things broken. Sorority houses would never survive as the clean, pretty environments that they are currently. None of the sorority girls that I know would ever consent to live in any of the fraternity houses on our campus.

Secondly, the other issue is rando's. Rando's are random people who show up to parties that they were not invited to and try to get in. It will happen and some of them will be drunk enough to get forceful. It helps being when the party is being hosted in a house full of guys who can physically remove unwanted people from the premises. |-|

In the 60s and 70s feminism rejected it until it became more and more common again starting in the 90s. 

I think it had to do with the American fetish of the perfect body in general (body-building, boob-obsession) and a trend in porn.

By the way: saying that you do it just for yourself basically means you have at least to some point internalized certain beauty standards. Not that there is necessarily anything wrong with that. |-|

While digging in one of the closets she found a hidden cabinet on the top shelf and inside were a couple of paper bags holding forceps and other medical instruments.  After asking around the neighborhood (and y'all this is for real) she learned that the old man (or the father of the old man, I forget) who lived in the house before her was a doctor and during the evenings used to perform secret abortions.  

When you see something like that, it makes it all that much more real.  she brought them to work and everything.  It was so creepy, this shit really happened!  

We are human, and as unfortunate as it is, abortion has always been and always will be an unhappy necessity.  Whether or not abortions are easily accessible, they will happen.  Personally, if I'm ever in the uncomfortable

It's crazy what women of previous generations had to go through to get an abortion, and it's clear to see that women always have and always will find a way. It's our responsibility as a society to ensure we're defending the lives (and the rights) of women. It's apparent that women can, will, and do find a way.

The life of a thinking, feeling, breathing human being will always be more important than a non-thinking, non-feeling, non-breathing ball of cells that may have potential for life. Women are not incubators, and shouldn't be treated as such. |-|

Next, I wouldn't advise anyone with half as much on their plate as you have to outwardly try to date.  You SHOULD be social, you SHOULD get out there but even the most financially stable, gainfully employed, put together (no one actually is) person finds dating tough. 
Take care of you, keep those awesome friends close (they might have awesome friends you can date down the line too!) and know that you are truly and deeply worthy of something wonderful but that it requires patience. Sending you hugs. xx |-|

|-| cnxross || 8 || Because of Roe v. Wade and my ability to choose, I have been able to:  open a business and devote 14 hours a day along with my husband, maintain a happy marriage without the added stress of children, achieve a level of aesthetic (and actual) fitness that allows me to travel all over as a fitness personality, travel and more travel, decompression time which keeps me able to perform these many things at a high level, enough uninterrupted sleep to be able to wake up at 4 am every day so that I/we can run our business which opens at 5 am, devote a whole heck of a lot of our time to assist others (many, mothers) to achieving their goals and living a healthy existence for the sake and influence of their children, and, most importantly, the ability to live a life that *actually makes me happy.*  

I don't believe that unborn babies are devoid of value.  What I *do* believe is that the concept of "pursuit of happiness" is so important, that a life that is not even aware of itself and depends on sacrifices of the parents is subject to any possible conflict in desire for the pregnancy.  If we are forced into this decision, not only does it devalue life itself and any reason we have to live at all, but it cheapens the sacrifices that parents freely GIVE to their children.  You can't GIVE anything if it is not yours to give in the first place.   |-|

I'm no expert on El Salvadoran law, but something about this is off.  Those are inconsistent statements.  If her doctors testified against her (even under an agreement with the state to avoid liability) there is *some* indication (the doctors' testimony) that she intentionally terminated.

Which means that we can argue about whether intentional termination should be a crime, but unless someone wants to go so far as to say "El Salvador doesn't have a functioning criminal justice system", there *was* enough evidence to convince a jury that she intentionally terminated her pregnancy. |-|

|-| cnxwrhi || 12 || Like Roe v Wade, I am 42 as well. I was born at the beginning of January, after my mother nearly miscarried me every month of her pregnancy. She also had at least 2 miscarriages between my older sister's birth and mine.

Often I hear anti-choice talking heads say things like "what if your mother had aborted YOU?!" They've never asked me directly, so I'll just answer here.

My mother was denied choice. She wasn't allowed the choice of ending horribly problematic pregnancies that were doomed from the start, and she was forced to have no control over her own body and forced to be miserable.

If she'd been able to abort me, she might have. And if she had, I WOULDN'T KNOW IT, so it wouldn't matter to me. I don't have the right *now* to force another woman to obey what I want her to do with her body, and I don't think I have some right to force a woman to carry me to term. 

I don't want women to be forced into what my own mother was forced into. It's just not right. |-|

|-| cnxz6hl || 12 || That's a uterine/endometrial cast! I just had that happen to me last month except mine was actually pretty much a perfect cast of my entire uterus. It was this 2-3 inch sack thing with a large opening on top and then a small opening at the bottom like where the cervix would be and it even had little arm thingies on the side reaching up to where the fallopian tubes would be. When it happened, it was incredibly painful and there was a ton of blood and I started freaking out because I first thought that my entire uterus had fallen out because it literally looked like a uterus. Then I realized that wasn't possible and so I started freaking out that I was pregnant and miscarrying.

I took a pregnancy test almost immediately when it happened and it was negative so after a little bit of research I came across uterine casts and realized pretty quickly that that's what I had passed. I was about 8 weeks in to my first pack of extended cycle birth control pills and had previously been spotting for about a month so it was almost definitely related to my birth control use. I didn't save the tissue (although I did take a picture to show the doctor because I knew that they would try to pass it off as a blood clot or miscarriage). 

When I went to the doctor the following day they had never seen anything like it before (it was my student health center so not the highest quality of healthcare workers...) and so they sent me off for an ultrasound just to make sure there was nothing else wrong like an ectopic pregnancy or uterine fibroids. Oh and I also got a surprise first pelvic exam. Anyways, everything turned up completely normal so the doctors were eventually like "well this just seems to be related to your birth control pill use" and soon after my spotting stopped so I haven't had to return for any followup appointments. So hopefully it doesn't' happen again because giving birth to what is basically your uterus isn't very pleasant.  |-|

|-| cnxzdin || 3 || Dear CD (I have abbreviated your reddit name) you deleted the following question: 
&gt; Okay I had a 2 year stint of no sex, sure.. But 8 years? I mean, isn't occasional sex healthy for reproductive organs?

Totally a valid question, not sure why you deleted it. I wrote a response and was going to delete when I finished, hit send, and saw you deleted your question. But Just incase you are still lurking in the shadows **here WAS my answer:**
 

"Your probably right.

I often romanticize the thought of engaging in intercourse. But then I masturbate and that thought goes away. Sometimes it sticks, quite often it sticks. Sometimes I even wish for a boyfriend. I try to avoid my sad asocial reality by occupying my mind with work. In these situations I find myself surrounded by notes drenched in my tears.


But in all seriousness, I like to be alone and I can't make friends/boyfriends. Actually that is not true. I can make friends I just can't hold on to relationships because they exhausts me, I make a terrible mate so I save them from the inevitable frustration. I don't hook up with strangers because I am terrified of herpes - or any STD for that matter. I am also scared I will find an excellent std-free-one-night-partner, take him home only to find out he has poor oral hygiene. Unfortunately I don't have the heart to say anything upsetting to another person, so I would probably go along with it and cry a little on the inside. 

TL;DR I am a little pansy wisp of grass, who is terrified of poor hygiene and would rather not face the prospect of confrontation. Fingers it is." |-| 
|-| cny08zz || -9 || Love that a woman can decide when to be pregnant.

Also its kinda funny becuase if I was in his boots I probaly wouldn't mind if it, if it wasant art, but the fact that its art means that it is meant to be seen by others.  He just feels protective of you.

Either way, all that aside your in a relationship.  Relationships are about give and take.  Some times you need to give or vise versa.  |-|

|-| cny0s3n || -5 || Just from my viewpoint: it's totally your decision. If he feels uncomfortable about it, he's told you that, that should be the end of his involvement. But in the end it is YOUR decision, not his.

I know some of the commenters here are saying things like "try to see it from his point of view," and so on, but in my opinion this is the opening act for a control freak. I should know, I was married to one for 25 years.

It starts out with just small things, and of course you go along because it seems easier, but before you know it, he's dictating what you should and should not wear, or whether you can go to the store by yourself. I didn't even realize how controlled I was until after the divorce. I swear it took me two years to start making rational decisions on my own.

If you decide you want to not do this modeling, fine, but it should be YOUR DECISION. It's fine to acknowledge his uncomfortableness, but it's your choice, not his. |-| 
|-| cny0x15 || 3 || I went through a 7 year relationship myself before I realized how detrimental it was for me. It's a very long story with a lot of heartache, but I can tell you I was on the path towards my own demise and ultimate death. Sometimes you just don't realize what real love looks like until you experience it. BUT the first step is becoming aware that there is a difference! 

You MUST love yourself first. You will attract a person that loves you just as much as you love yourself in a matter of time. Don't be arrogant, just acknowledge your own wants, needs, desires and make way for them to be supported, by YOU first. 

Once you experience a relationship where your partner treats you amazingly, supports you 100% except when you need a little healthy kick in the butt (more like guidance than control), listens to you, makes time for you, makes an effort to tell you they love you frequently... It's then that you see why it's totally not worth pursuing a relationship where there isn't the same mutual respect. 

It's obvious you are two different pages. Good for you for recognizing it and realizing how it can be unhealthy and how that can spiral out of control from there onwards. You are a strong woman that deserves to see how valuable you are for yourself! You deserve the best! You deserve someone who loves, but doesn't put you on a leash. 

Other women in your situation could definitely learn from your example. :) |-| 
|-| cny0z9t || 5 || It's your decision, but whatever boundaries he wants to make in the relationship are his to make and for you to either respect or ignore.

January 10th I got told the baby that was inside me didn't have a heartbeat. I could either wait until the baby came out on its own, I could pay out of pocket a few grand for a D&amp;amp;C, I could take medication to make me contract that may or may not work, OR go to planned parenthood and get an abortion that was completely covered. After waiting 3 weeks with no sign of the baby, I decided on the surgical abortion. I got it done yesterday. Im upset because I wanted the baby, but there is nothing I can do. The outcome would have been the same. 

Being there and seeing what those girls are going through changed my way of thinking completely. I never want to have to go through that again.

|-| cny4axd || 5 || I can't comment as to the uterine casts/mud babies as I haven't experienced that bodily miracle, but I just wanted to sympathise with you regarding the brown discharge. I've been experiencing what looks to be very similar (minus the chunks) for the past 3 months now. No pain, no discomfort, no weird smells, and no idea what the cause is. Pap smear came back normal; no pregnancy; no STIs or other infections. I have seen two doctors who didn't know what the reason was. I was taking Ava 30, but had been for over 2 years (consistently, same time every night) so was told it was extremely unlikely to be BC related. I apparently had a yeast infection (sans any symptoms) so treated that, but the discharge has continued. Switched BC to Norimin on the off-chance it was a hormonal thing but it's still happening, and now I'm waiting to have a colposcopy to see if it's caused by something the Pap missed. 

It's quite depressing, not knowing what the cause is or if there is anything wrong - not to mention how gross it makes me feel. I miss my friendly vagina and its normal discharge!!

So, probably not the same thing, but I just wanted to sympathise and thank you for posting your experience as I think this sort of thing that isn't talked about enough, and it definitely should be!! |-|

|-| cny6e7h || 9 || I know how hard it can be to come out. I'm transgender and have also been through a lot of depression and multiple suicide attempts. Before I came out I thought I would lose what little I had. I thought that if people knew the real me they would wouldn't love me anymore. But at the same time I felt that the person they loved was someone else and not the real me. I know it can be hard because your scared of losing your friends. When I came out, I did lose a few friends and it hurt to watch them go. But those friends that left never loved the real me. And as for the friends that stuck with me, their love finally meant something to me because I knew they loved the real me.

Sorry that I'm kinda rambling on but what I'm trying to say is be yourself. It is way more important to love yourself first. There are people out there that will love you for being yourself. And when you love yourself and others love you back, that's when you have something special. And if somebody leaves you because they can't except that you are bi, then they never loved the real you anyways. I know this is way easier said than done and it took me way to long to get to this point (I still struggle every now and again) but this is where true happiness and the best and closest friends are found. |-|

|-| cobhpc9 || 28 || Jesus, this is dead on. I'm a female welder and I would LOVE to get FR pants. I'd buy the hell out of 'em. Or, any heavy duty pant that will fit my ginormous ass and small waist.  |-| 
|-| cobd0ef || 51 || This is so true. I spent a couple of years on the VFD. There were no fire boots for women. I had to buy a pair of men's that caused massive blisters every time I used them. 
Women's work clothing is so inadequate too. I bought a pair of work jeans and foolishly didn't check the front pockets. I couldn't even keep my keys in them. Yeah, when I go out to the back forty I always carry a purse. Ranch wear is the worst. Men get lined jeans and work boots. The women's side has pink and bling.
 |-| 
|-| cobehi5 || 19 || Oh god yes about the cut!  See that motocross outfit there? That's my pain.  I end up buying guys' pants and jerseys because the womens' jerseys are too short for me and too narrow in the shoulders.  End up with guys' pants because I swear they must use junior's sizing.  Guys boots too because I have thick calfs (calves?).  

MX clothing color is a whole different barrel of fish.  I don't WANT pink gear.   I don't like pink. Most everything is pink.  Piiiiiiink.  Ugh.  I just want factory colors like the guys have in a cut that fits me. |-|

|-| cobeaoa || 36 || I'm a man, but my wife and other woman that she has talked to about this hate the fact that should straps on backpacks and the cross buckle on the straps don't take into account for the fact the woman have breasts and that they are different sizes. Our friends have had to turn down a purchase of a backpack because the straps wouldn't fit their breasts. |-| 
|-| cobhebj || 14 || YES. For non-form-fitting outdoor gear, I wouldn't even mind wearing men's clothes if they went down to my size. But they don't (which must be really annoying for short guys, too). So for each piece of equipment, I have to go through reviews of men's products (because few people even write reviews of womens), and afterwards see if the company makes an equivalent for women. And then even if they do, in most cases I find the women's version is a weird cut, slightly less functional, or a hideous colour. AND costs around 10% more. 

Don't even get me started on pockets. |-| 
|-| cobkqg5 || 18 || Step 1: Start with women's pants. 
Step 2: Add men's sized pockets. 
Step 3: ??????
Step 4: Profit.  |-| 
|-| cobnpy8 || 6 || It seems to me the reason for a lack of choices for women is because most of the sales don't go to outdoors women but instead are sold for looks. Hence the pastels and neons. I think and entirely new company should be started to take all the business away from the companies that don't offer the choices muscular active women need. Because honestly the companies won't change because it's more profitable with the current model.  |-| 
|-| cobpl6w || 7 || For the love of god, please start making the same colors available for everyone of all genders.  I get that some women adore pink, and some men love yellow, but let's all have the choice.  The only women's climbing shoes available are pink, purple, teal or floral.  Let me wear black or orange, damnit. |-| 
|-| cobpmzy || 6 || I can't really wear women's running shorts. They ride up, my thunder thighs peek through, I don't like flopping around, etc. 

Soccer shorts. Soccer shorts are where it's at. They make women's soccer shorts so they don't land halfway down your thighs like the guy cuts land on me and everything I want hidden stays hidden. And they are in bland colors. Colors that match regular t-shirts. Black, navy, maroon, red, an occasional white, forest. I can't say I've ever seen neon or pastel soccer shorts. They are truly a cut and color for my personality. A lady stopped me once and asked me what the name of my shorts were. She told me I was brilliant. Soccer shorts for the win. 

Here is a fun story to further prove my disdain for running shorts. The other day I was doing a five mile trail run (so maybe I don't thunder and flop as much as I let on), when I looked down at my short running shorts to find the white waistband string was hanging out the bottom of my pants. It looked like my tampon string was hanging out. I'm sure nobody noticed, but if I had been wearing my soccer shorts, it would not have been a problem. 

Soccer shorts.  |-| 
|-| cobpgsa || 3 || The colors and designs offered for womens gear are my biggest pet peeve. Like I have a "women's bike" (meaning its meant for people with shorter torsos) and it has fugly hibiscus flowers all over it that remind me of PacSun circa 2001. |-| 
|-| cobq4pm || 3 || 5.11 makes wonderful women clothing for my job. I have some 5.11 taclites that actually allow room in my hip area and butt area lol. They are also just as professional looking as the men's line. They also make excellent boots that I wear everyday at work. 


My work shirt is a polo shirt "cut for women". I have room in the shirt, but the armpit area hugs my body like nobody's business. Other than that... It is comfortable. 


I was annoyed when buying winter gear though. Seriously, no thermal stuff that isn't pink? I hate pink... I just want plain black. 


I couldn't find decently warm gloves that fit my tiny child hands so I had to special order ($$$) from the company and they still don't fit good enough. I also struggled to find warm comfortable black socks in women's I have to wear men's socks a size too big because they don't make women's socks black.


Edit: I love these pants!

|-| cobp815 || 4 || I wish companies would create or expand their petite lines. I'm almost 5'5" but I have a very short waist. Just about every "normal" size shirt  is ridiculously long on me. I have a large chest but narrow shoulders. Considering the average height of an American woman is 5'4", I don't get it. Do they all have extra long torsos and roll up their pants?

Ready-to-wear clothing is not friendly to those who stray very far from whatever the standard garment fitting model is today. |-| 
|-| cobpvxr || -4 || &gt;What is the message here? That women should dress the way men do, but remain weaker?

The message is that either the vast majority of women have narrow arms, or the vast majority of women like this type of clothing. They make it because it sells well. That's it. Capitalism at work. 

Nobody has a personal vendetta about your sleeve diameter.

|-| cob0dfi || 340 || You know, every time I see threads like these. I see advice saying "You have to be abrasive, don't be afraid to upset anyone etc" if you want respect. Honestly, think about it, you already feel marginalised, and now you are just going to be a bitch to everyone? How do you think that will work?

A girl I used to work with came up to me once, not in front of anyone and just said "Joe*, I know you didn't mean to, but you interrupted me before and went off on a long tangent, I was trying to say something, you know?"

I completely understood, apologised and was very conscious of doing it again. 

Stares, passive agressiveness or bitchy bluntness will never beat good communication skills.

|-| cob8o7c || 39 || Out of 400 linemen I am one of 3 women. You want respect you have to be able to laugh and dish out the same amount of crap that you is dished to you. Don't be uptight. Be quick witted. In this environment crude humor is the best kind. And.... guys love thier poop jokes. After years if hearing them I can now hang my head and say... Ok that is funny.


Now sometimes men will say something around you just to feel you out. To see if you are shocked. Nothing shocks me anymore. Chances are if you are truly offended it is because they truly wanted to offend you. Then you fire back. Typically that will end with everyone laughing. No big deal. If its something extremely offensive ill say something personally away from everyone else. That has happened 2 times in 8 years.  


The other 99 percent of the time it's all bullshit and you just have to laugh. These guys are my brothers. Union shout out! |-| 
|-| coay6fe || 36 || I work in a male dominated industry and to me, it's about standing your ground. I feel it's a fine line between being abrasive and being rude. When engaging in conversation,  I keep it to a minimum and business realted. If I was disregarded, cut off, or perhaps ignored, sometimes all you can do is move on. Make sure you have all the information before approaching anyone. 

I always have all facts and information before I speak to my coworkers so they don't have a reason to be disrespectful or dismissing. Document your actions and be civil. There will be times that things won't work in your favor or that you will be seen as just a woman. I work hard to advance and sometimes it takes a slap in the face of performance and steadfastness that earns you that place. |-| 
|-| cob2h20 || 57 || I work in a male-dominated industry (software) and I am the only female on my team. I have not experienced any sexism, harassment, or problems with disrespect. My team is comprised of awesome people, such that I don't even think about our genders at all in our daily interactions. It isn't even an issue. 

But I do acknowledge that I am lucky, and that other women do experience a great deal of difficulty in their line of work. |-| 
|-| coazjsk || 93 || Having dealt with similar issues throughout most of my career I have found a number of strategies helpful;

1) Verbalizing your ideas;
If someone interrupts you and begins talking about a different topic or issue I would say "interesting idea, but we digress" and then continue what you were talking about before.
If someone is putting emphasis on a solution or idea you disagree with I would say "[so and so]'s idea has merit but I am concerned we might be underemphasising [your idea]" or if the conversation travels into debate territory I would throw out a "Well we will have to agree to disagree on this topic but I think we should consider all options to cover our bases especially [your idea]" 

2) Practice your stare down, seriously.  You want your stare (its a stare or look that you are going for you don't want it to be a glare)  to convey to the person you are giving it to "you are being disrespectful, you know it and I know it everyone knows it so STOP"

3) When walking in the hall or in the elevator etc. watch your facial expressions.  I will admit I tend to look pissed off if I don't watch my expressions and its kind of hard to like someone that's pissed off all of the time (yes, like. some people find it hard to respect people that they don't like or that they think don't like them). When passing people in the hall I would almost half smile and nod my head a bit as a hello and in the elevator I would smile just a tiny bit and if you make eye contact make a comment about the weather or something.

4) Know your stuff.

5) Pick your battles wisely.

6) Personally I don't wear skirts to work, ever.  I find that when I do more attention is paid to my body than what I am saying so I always wear pants.  Maybe its just me but I find that it helps with the respect issue.

7) Knowing and making peace with the fact that some people can not be won over or worn down.  Some people think that as a woman you should not be there or are only there to make HR happy.  It is usually how they were raised and what era they grew up in and sometimes there is just nothing that you can do to change their minds and opinions.

Hopefully you have found something helpful in all that.  |-| 
|-| cobfdpa || 7 || I used to be a lift mechanic. 
My supervisor said on many occasions that I should get a man's help with basic duties of my job. I just ignored him and did it anyway. 

Once we were hanging what we call a work basket. It basically replaces a seat on a chair lift and is exactly what it seems like, a hanging basket that holds tools and has a step to stand on to access shaeve assemblies (i.e. the wheels on a chair lift). It's sort of awkward but not heavy, probably around 100 lbs. He told me to get one of the guys to hang it for me, so I asked him to help. Since he was old and fat and has back issues he couldn't and just stood their silently while I did it with the help of a female coworker. That was satisfying. 

Now I work for the government and it's fucking rad. No one gives a shit I'm a girl and their not impressed that I can do stuff. They're just like stfu and do your job.  |-| 
|-| cob9wqc || 11 || I started as the only female developer in a software company. I am now a technical team lead. 

Number one important thing. Know what you're talking about. If you don't know either don't talk or say you don't know. There is nothing worse than pretending to know and you loose huge points.

Number two. Throw your weight. Don't think you're different. Do your job. Get noticed for doing your job. Speak out. Join conversations. Give your opinion. A few well placed "that's what she said"s always go down well. You want to respected as one of the team, act as one of the team.

Number three. Be nice. Simples.

I'm lucky that I've never had someone disrespect me. People do interrupt, but that's how normal conversations work. You just come back and say your piece later. You have to earn respect, you can't just assume you should get it. |-| 
|-| coazb87 || 20 || &gt; 2) Interrupting

This may not work for everyone, but it worked for me when I had a co-worker who constantly would try to interrupt me. I would just keep talking while starting right at them, not breaking my speech or my stride. When I was done I would politely address them and say, "Did you want to add something to what I was saying?" or something similar. Try to phrase it so it is clear to them and everyone you were speaking and now is the appropriate time to add something. Consistently shut them down, show them you won't be interrupted, remind them visually they are interrupting you. Eventually they person learned not to interrupt so many people because it didn't work.  |-| 
|-| cobi8yr || 6 || As a female leader in a male dominated field, I have a lot of experience with this. Some tips off the top of my head include:

If interrupted, once they are finished, simply repeat yourself.  Do this as many times as necessary.  

If spoken to in a paternalistic tone I have been known to repeat the words or tone back to them a few minutes later in the conversation just obviously enough that they immediately recognized how shameful their behavior was.  If they get upset/defensive/insulted say, oh I couldn't agree more, I’m so glad you feel the same way and must have been joking when you said the same thing to me 5 min ago I just wasn't sure how to respond to that.  This is slightly immature behavior but I can't help myself sometimes.  I usually get an apology or the behavior is simply never repeated.  

Watch your syntax, for example, do not say, “I think we should…” Say, “X needs to be done…”

Don’t enable others due to your need to be liked.  In fact, get rid of your need to be liked altogether if you want to be successful in upper management, replace it with a need to be fair.  

If blatant sexist/hostile jokes, state immediately, “(Person's name), that’s inappropriate.” Don’t blush and fake laugh.  They are testing you.  Draw the line early.  

I tend to speak softly but carry a big stick.  I understand this might not work for everyone though.  

Do not get emotional, this includes anger. Your tone is very important.  Pleasant, professional, direct, fair and firm.  Do not engage in passive aggressive issues.  Do not call summit meetings over petty indifferences, you will be written off.  

If needed, restate your point more than once.  Sometimes I will state my point and people will dismiss it as if I didn't matter.  Especially on a conference call where they haven't met me yet, I think it's because I have a young sounding female voice.  I simply wait until they are finished and restate my point.  By the third time they know I mean business.  

Do not concede.  Hold your ground.  You may agree to disagree but if you are in charge, don’t let others direct you.  

I do not agree on the policy of not wearing a skirt; just don’t wear one 2” above the knee, wear one inch min shoulder straps, and never show cleavage.  Always look your best even if that means you are beautiful.  Beautiful woman can be smart and successful too.  

Do not engage in gossip.  Avoid personality clashes.  

If you have an issue with someone, immediately address it one on one, calmly.  Rehearse ahead of time and prepare your answer to the worst case response.  Repeat yourself if necessary.  Regardless of the outcome, thank them for their time and move on.  You must move on and let it go.  Do not dwell on issues you can’t solve.  Follow up pleasantly with kindness on a different subject within 24 hours to show that you have moved on and to smooth over the relationship.  

Sit at the head of the conference table.  Assert yourself.  Prepare before big meetings and say something profound and positive early in the meeting.  

Realize that men who engage in these behaviors tend to have the lowest self esteem and they really have no power over you. 

Women are often perpetrator of sexism.  Be sure to support other women and mentor the ones you can.  

Accept criticism with grace, try to better yourself from it.   Acknowledge a mistake.  People will respect you and believe you the next time since you are proven to be honest.

|-| cobk1h7 || 6 || I don't necessarily have a good answer but I have input on the subject. I'm a 28 year old female plant mechanic (think heavy diesel earth moving equipment) and for what is worth in 5'3" and weigh a total of 54kgs. I have been surrounded by only men for most of my career, and some jobs before this one also. Fortunately for me I am naturally assertive and I have found the best approach for me personally is to make it clear, through my work and vocally, that I am here to be treated as an equal. I find more often than not in my trade that the men sway more towards patronising me. I'm younger than most, I'm smaller and weaker than all of them, they definitely try to step in and do my job for me at times. I have to tell them "I'm here to do the same job as you, allow me to do it. If I need your help, I will definitely ask." 
I have only ever had one serious issue
with a man who spoke extremely inappropriately to me - he made some strange reference to "dick being right up my alley" based solely on the fact I was female. I was fortunate enough to have witnesses (all male) who immediately reacted in a positive way, telling him how WAY out of line he was. I also made it very clear to him that there was no way I would stand for being spoken to like that, at work or anywhere else. I chose not to report the incident at the time, sometimes I think I should have but he has never spoken to me again. It's been about 3 years since the incident and I recently changed work places, so I no longer have to deal with him. Yay.  |-| 
|-| coazwk0 || 21 || I have worked in several law firms in the south now where I am the only female or there is only one other female.  I'm a paralegal, so I'm already "below" the attorneys, but they never disrespect me.  How do I do it?  Give respect.  I listen to them when they talk and take notes.  I do NOT interrupt during meetings, but if I have something to say I wait for an opening and say it concisely.  I complete assignments on time and to the best of my abilities.  I handle things for the attorneys by using my own knowledge so I do not have to involve them (this is extremely important in a paralegal and actually very rare - they hired you to do all the day to day BS for them so they don't have to, if you have to ask them about every little thing, it's going to become irritating).  I wear EXTREMELY girly dresses and outfits to work, I never wear pants because I hate pants.  I take initiative and do things the attorneys haven't even asked me to do that they are very grateful for.  If they respect you for being smart, a self-starter, and a good employee, they shouldn't be talking down to you regardless of your gender, age, or what you wear.  If they are, find a new job. |-|

|-| cob6c5l || 16 || I have a question regarding this.  To what extent is it 'subtle disrespect' versus 'differences in the ways the genders communicate'?  

I ask because a lot of what you mention happens to men too, but (I'm speaking broadly here) for the most part they're used to it and know the appropriate response.  Guy cuts me off, I realize it's a subtle dominance play, go, "I didn't realize I was finished" then finish my thought.  Things like that.  

I think you can similarly draw an analogy to doing business in different cultures.  Practices that might seem completely bizarre to a Swiss businessperson (for example) might be perfectly normal in say India.  And likewise, practices that seem bizarre to the Indian, might make perfect sense to the Swiss.  

Is it a 'sexism/gender-normative' problem or a 'differing communication displays of dominance' one? |-| 
|-| cob15bs || 14 || As a male I have seen this occur to both male and female co-workers, done by both male and females. I think it comes down to re-acting politely "Pardon me, if you wouldn't mind letting me finish" or "I understand your point there is no reason to be rude" said in your own typical tone. I have found that if you can maintain a consistent attitude people become easier to deal with. |-| 
|-| cobhaa3 || 4 || Hello there, I'm a woman working in a field with 0.7% women and 99.3% men. (Industrial mechanic at the moment, though I've been a pipeline welder and a machinist in the past.) 

/r/BlueCollarWomen is the sub specifically for women in male dominated careers. Most of our current members are skilled tradeswomen (welders, carpenters, mechanics, pipefitters) but many are also programmers, engineers, and business leaders.

What I've found is to be competent first. If your work is good, your skill is visible and well known, you get respect. It's harder, and takes time building, but eventually for the most part that does it. Sometimes you come across assholes who won't give you that chance to prove your mettle and skill. Or those who are blind to it. So be confident as well, speak up (no whispers or mumbles especially in groups), direct eye contact, open body language, and still smile and be polite. I kill 'em with a mix of kindness and ruggedness, it works for me in my field. I'll be spitting bullets and "fuck you ya fuckn' fucks" one minute and "Hey Randy ya all right? Stop a second and go get yourself some water, I got this." |-| 
|-| cobldz4 || 4 || People who do the above things you mention are just assholes. I've been working for 35 years now and I've never felt disrespected because of my gender. One career (10 years) was 90% men, another probably 60% men. Plenty of female assholes out there. 

Don't be an asshole, and when you are dealing with one, be professional every single time. You're not going to change an asshole, even if you're married to them, certainly much less at work. Respond professionally and move on. 

You can be a victim if you want or you can get back to work.  |-| 
|-| cobpck3 || 3 || pick your battles. ask yourself, is this person just a jerk to everyone or are they blatantly disrespecting me *because I am a woman*. If so, raise an eyebrow, look them straight in the eye, and move on. Arguing in a professional setting will make you look childish, no matter if you're the victim. And you are not. You are not a victim. Most people with any decent amount of stature and/or intelligence will respect any person who is knowledgeable and dependable, without any concern of gender. If they lack this, what is the point in arguing with an idiot?  Also, understand that the more you confident and relaxed you are, the better you can handle disagreement or conflict.  |-| 
|-| cobpf9f || 3 || A tip from behavior analysis. If you feel like strangling the person, walk away, no talking, no emotion. The behavior is likely attention-maintained, and so if you attend to it, no matter what you say, abrasive or not, you reinforce the behavior.   
  
If - on the other hand - you want to run, stand your ground and repeat yourself with no emotion. Behavior that makes you want to run is generally escape-maintained. If you run, avoid, leave, and behavior is reinforced and will escalate in most cases.   
  
If you have been reinforcing behaviors for a long while, when you change tactics, you will see an immediate spike in behavior, continue (unless its dangerous) with your flip of script, and just when you think you can't take anymore, the behavior will change.  |-| 
|-| coay1wo || 28 || You might not like the answer but it's what most people would consider "being a b****". You say "excuse me, may I finish?" when you get interrupted. You say "I don't need you to explain how that works to me" when you're being talked down to about something you're knowledgeable about. Try to be as diplomatic as possible, but it's plain uncomfortable to have to put people in their place like that. There isn't really an easy way to do it.

Edit: it's also important to make people spell out their marginalizations in plain english when they hint at them. Acting ignorant, politely asking "what do you mean by that?" when they hint at a judgement. Basically making them say out loud how stupid they are makes them feel very foot-in-mouth and you don't have to be excessively assertive. |-|

Clearly they thought I couldn't hear them, but I could and it felt so disrespectful and insulting. 

How'd I handle it? I kept drinking, got angrier, and eventually, a few hours later when they'd probably forgotten about even talking about it I told them that it's not something they need to worry about because none of us would want to fuck them.

I dealt with projector/computer connections all the time at my previous job, so it was a quick fix of command+F7 (on that laptop setting) and it worked.  

My manager in the room saw I fixed it, but he said "Thanks for your help Bob!" I responded with "I got it working" and Bob acknowledged me that I did.  My manager said "Ok, great," and the presentation resumed. After the presentation was over I walked by my manager's office to return to my office, and he stopped me and said: "Sorry I didn't say this, but thanks for your help earlier."

|-| cobo0co || 4 || First, I am the only one who's tired of having female subs on Reddit that are filled with men telling us how wrong we are about our own experiences? 

On the topic of this question, I've been round and round about this problem and I frankly find it exhausting to try to ride the very thin line between being treated fairly and coming off as a giant bitch. I once snapped at a male co-worker who, after goading me on various topics for a few days prior, set me off at a very bad time by telling me over and over to smile. I lost it at him, unprofessionally, and ripped into him pretty hard. Usually I keep it together but I had had enough that time. I wish I had not lashed out but had handled it more calmly. But then, would it have worked? He certainly didn't goad me anymore for the rest of that job.

In my field women are always the minority, and it's not uncommon for me to be the only woman working in a group of men (but things have been getting better lately in that regard). I have to listen to a lot of sexism and sexist remarks, and have to just shut up about 99% of it otherwise I look like I'm just constantly causing trouble, or at the very least a stick in the mud.

The tactic I try to use most is humor. But my work environment is much more casual than an office environmen, so I don't think that's a great tactic for many situations. But it may help in more personal/causal environments. I think it needs a base level of friendship, no matter how small, to work.

I will say that I have learned some bad habits due to this. I can be terrible at interrupting at times, and I have a tendency to talk louder if I feel I'm not being heard. I think that's due to trying to overcompensate. |-| 
|-| cobp5r0 || 5 || I have a POV on this that may be interesting. I have worked in the same department for many years now, in a bunch of different teams. The people cycle through so much, and I look so different, that most people don't know I've worked here as a guy and a girl.

as a guy I was promoted often and respected for my honest (though abrasive at times) feedback and my ideas were always sought. I would be asked if I had any input before meetings were concluded and my opinion had a lot of weight.

Now...Working as a female I've been counselled and am under threat of losing my job if I'm not more polite in my dealings with staff. I take exception to people explaining very simple concepts to me and not  acknowledging that I am a subject matter expert. every suggestion I make is interpreted as me having a lack of understanding about the issue. When I point this out, I get complaints to my team leader. So now I don't speak up and I just do what I'm told. I try to speak as little as possible. 

Which means that my input, which was previously highly sought after, no longer exists because it comes from a woman. |-|

|-| coay9hi || 5 || I wish there was something for exactly what you describe - it's a lot easier to know how to react when there's a blantant disregard for you because you're female. It's a lot harder when it's subtle, and even worse when it's institutional gender bias. . .  |-| 
|-| cob8l8o || -6 || Women are accused, sometimes rightly so, of being overly emotional.  If you don't want to be written off as being a chick in the workplace, you have to use logic and good communication skills, NOT emotion.  Men just don't respond well when women are emotional.  

Don't be bitchy, that gets you nowhere.  You can be direct and truthful without being a bitch.

Tact and professionalism will get you a lot farther than you think. |-| 
|-| cob8ikb || -12 || An older male perspective here, for what it is worth. Seems to me women have a chip on their shoulders exactly as blacks do. As a male, all my career I've been spoken to in a paternalistic manner, interrupted, marginalized, etc. too. I didn't whine and cry about it. Sometimes I had to eat dirt and could not stand up for myself. Sometimes I've stood up for myself, usually in a manner befitting the slight (the more slight, the more indignation I've countered with). But open your eyes: men treat PEOPLE badly many times. Women do too. This isn't a women against men issue. I've had my share of mistreatment from women, too. Men behave differently than women, and you can't force them to treat you the way another woman treats you because they are different. Would you even want men to behave cattily towards you? Or you can continue pitying yourself and feeling the victim.  |-|

|-| cob586x || 119 || FGM is so terrible, I hope everything can be done to bring it to a halt, and where possible to prosecute those who are performing and condoning it.

But the prosecution of this doctor was an outrage. Here's what happen according to the court transcripts:

The pregnant women was mistakenly not put on the FGM pathway; which meant that she was not seen and looked-after by a FGM specialist.

She had previously had her infibulation stitches removed, and the entrance to her vaginal canal was open for the birth. This happened a good time before her pregnancy.

After the birth, the delivery doctor has to deal with the two flaps of skin (what remains of the mutilation of her labia lips) which are now hanging down. The normal procedure is to put ONE stitch in EACH side, to hold them back against the pubic area.

This doctor, who had no experience with FGM patients, instead, put ONE stitch to hold the flaps together in the centre. This was (according to the medical personnel) at the insistence/request of both the mother and the other defendant (who one assumes) was the father.

This is technically FGM, and the doctor was told so by another member of staff. The hospital considered it a training matter. But then the police were called, and the doctor was arrested.

Later, the doctor claimed, that he had done it for what he considered medical necessity. i.e.: the women was bleeding etc.

The jury took just 30 minutes to find him not guilty.

It just beggars belief, that the National Health Service has to spend millions helping women who have suffered FGM in their own countries; and helps them with a safe birth; and then the NHS doctors and medical personnel are prosecuted because they failed on a technicality, whilst dedicating they professional lives to helping such women.

Unbelievable. And all this time, young girls are sent abroad for a "party" in their "home" countries during UK school holidays, and they return with mutilated genitals. And nothing is done about this.

EDIT: And it seems the doctor saved her life as she was having a difficult birth!!! |-| 
|-| cob3yix || 51 || After reading around other news sources all he did was restitch a wound ( I assume a scar) that occurred after this woman gave birth. Essentially stating that he 'redid' the FGM, his reasoning was to stop the bleeding. This isn't the kind of case I expect to be brought in FGM prosecution.  |-| 
|-| cob2vvu || 24 || Because he didn't do it |-| 
|-| cob9qow || 23 || I called this result on the first day of the case. There was not a cat in hells chance he was going to be found guilty. 

The CPS are being criticized for their low FGM prosecution rate. Much, much easier to go after a doctor than it would be to confront the parents of the children who return from their "holiday" circumcised.  

Normally in the first 30 minutes a Jury is picking a foreman, they then retire for the night to start deliberations fresh in the morning. The fact they came back on day one after only 30 minutes shows what an absolute farce this prosecution was.

I only hope the doctor hasn't gone bankrupt trying to defend himself from this (contrary to what people may think the trust won't pay for the legal defence of doctors in such circumstances).  |-| 
|-| cobl86p || 3 || Honest question here, because I'm totally ignorant. Why the fuck does FGM happen? |-| 
|-| cob94me || -29 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| cobry9l || 20 || Thank you for posting this. This exact scenario happened to me. At my 20 week ultrasound it was discovered for the first time that my daughter was not viable. Leaving out many details (unless someone is interested), I had to make the most horrific decision I can imagine. Instead of a typical abortion I CHOSE to be induced early. I made that choice for my daughter, not myself. Any woman in that terrible situation should be able to end the pregnancy. And don't even get me started on how I couldn't be induced and have my stillborn baby at the hospital where I worked--nope, it's Catholic owned. This whole big group of people think your decision to not let your child suffer and die means you're going to hell. Sigh...I've gotten off track but my point is abortion after 20 weeks just HAS to stay legal.  |-| 
|-| cobk4mr || 27 || There are a lot of serious defects which just can't be seen in the early stages of pregnancy. Removing women's options to terminate a pregnancy after 20 weeks will only do more harm than good. This means that families will be hit with the double whammy of knowing their child has terrible defects, will probably not live at all, or live in pain and have to undergo multiple expensive, risky, and painful surgeries and there's nothing they can do about it.

If they absolutely must set a point after which the only abortions would be to save the mother's life, why not set it at 24 weeks? That's the point when the baby is viable outside the mother (with tons of help and a lot of luck) and past the point where most defects would have already been identified. That would give women time to research and decide if abortion is the right option for their circumstance. |-| 
|-| cobra8d || 3 || Does anyone on this thread support abortions past 20 weeks for non-medical reasons? |-| 
|-| cobs391 || -11 || "One of the biggest misconceptions is that we’re just making these spur of the moment decisions without giving it much thought"

|-| cobqle8 || -16 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| cobireq || 87 || Personally, now that you feel strongly you were manipulated into doing it, you should talk to her.  Let her know what she asked you to do was wrong, it put you in an uncomfortable position, and in future, she can keep her requests to herself.

You have a hard time standing up for yourself, as you're coming to realize.  I think it's important that you begin to take a bit more control so people like this coworker cannot continue to mean girl you.  It's obvious you are the only one in this uneasy friendship paying for her bad behavior, and that's just not fair to you. |-| 
|-| cobiufi || 27 || I don't think it was appropriate for her to put you in that situation, however, I don't think that in the long run it will really affect the kiddo.  I was adopted at birth.  All my life I longed to know my birth family.  When I was 18, I discovered that my adoptive parents had kept a lot of information from me, and I was upset about it.  But there are plenty of other traumatic things that adopted kids can go through, that something like this probably will be just a blip on the radar.  And that's only if she ever finds out.  In my personal opinion, I believe your writing out the card is harmless.  However, I do feel it might have been better had the mom requested something like this from a family member, or a close friend, not a coworker.  I'm sorry you're feeling so unpleasant about this, but try to remember, what's done is done.  You can't unwrite the card.  Just know that it's probably not going to ever come up.  And this little girl still got what she wanted for her birthday.  I would have done anything to get a letter from my mom, even if it wasn't the original copy. |-| 
|-| cobia5f || 37 || She should never have put you in that position. Ever. It was horribly wrong of her.

Okay, you could have said no, but it's not always possible to know how bad something is until it's too late.

*HUG* |-| 
|-| cobkm2p || 18 || This comment has nothing to do with the issue of adoption, forgery, etc.

But my suggestion, based on personal experience, is to go to the library and find self-help books on assertiveness. That's what I have done, and it helped _immensely_. Just reading about the psychology of it -- of asserting yourself, of the importance of protecting your boundaries, of _setting_ boundaries to begin with -- was so helpful, and these books often have examples and scripts that might give you a nice little collection of go-to phrases to use when you find yourself in these situations. |-| 
|-| cobjhmb || 21 || 

There might have not actually been anything legally wrong with giving out the address, and there probably wasn't since it made it to your coworker address intact, but you co-worker might just have not wanted her daughter to have it. Maybe she didn't want to make herself look bad in front of you. I don't know the situation. Sometimes a tough choice has to be made. I think we have to remember that the girl is in your coworkers care so it's really her decision. You're right that she shouldn't have asked you, though.

My boyfriend buys a gift for our nephew from his mom for him every birthday and every Christmas, just because it's sometimes easier than saying "sorry, your mom's a drug addict and isn't coming to see you again.". He's waited too many times for phone calls and visits that never happened and that side of the family just decided that, for now, it's better he just believes his mom is sending him these things. 

Will he hate us for it when he grows up?? Maybe. Probably, actually. But we hope that he will eventually understand.

Personally, I'm really happy your coworkers daughter is going to be getting that birthday card. 

 |-| 
|-| cobpiqx || 5 || Don't sweat this from the perspective of your participation in actually writing the card. The kid's okay &amp; will get a card from her birth mom, albeit transcribed.  That's all okay.

Focus on managing the work situation; figure out how to get back on a professional level with this coworker so she doesn't try to draw you into her drama. |-| 
|-| cobq0p0 || 4 || Don't feel so bad about this.  Daughter already knows that adopted mom knows how to contact birth mom, because she got the birthday she requested.  Daughter also knows that adopted mom (and social worker) feel that it is inappropriate for her have direct contact with her mom at this time, or they would have allowed it.

And not allowing direct contact is probably a very reasonable stance to take with a 10-year-old.  If I were adopted mom I wouldn't want my parenting decisions undermined by birth mom.  If birth mom were at all fit to be a parent she likely wouldn't be in this position.  

As for your discomfort at being "bullied:, maybe start by making your default response to requests by your co-worker "Now's not a good time" instead of "Sure, what do you need?"  It may take her a while to get the hint, but pretty soon she'll likely find someone more pliable to push around. |-| 
|-| cobr4n1 || 4 || I don't see what it is you think was wrong about the situation. The birth mother is not legally entitled to see or hear from her child, as the adopted mother your co-worker has every right to control what kind of contact her child has with the birth mother. The birth mother stopped being a part of this child's family when she made the decision to give her child up, and is essentially a stranger. Your co-worker has already decided at ten years old to tell her child about the adoption and allow him/her to receive mail from the mom, that is beyond what most adoptive parents feel is right for their children to know at that age. If the previous family situation really is that bad (which is entirely possible) it's understandable that your co-worker would not like her child to find out through letters with his/her mother.  You may feel that it is wrong to keep the address hidden or that you are manipulating a child, but this is a ten year old not a grown adult, the option to write their birth parent will be available to them when they are older more mature and prepared to learn about family drama etc. You may not like your co-worker, but in this instance it sounds like she's doing something nice for her kid. |-| 
|-| coblhhs || 7 || You made a decision based upon the information that you had at the time, and you made the best decision that you could, using your own moral compass.

In your own heart, you did what you thought was best.

The real decision-making came from your co-worker, and any rightness or wrongness of this situation rests squarely on her shoulders.  She has far more information than you.

You were given a limited time-frame to fully think about what you were being asked to do, and now you are reflecting on what happened and thinking very deeply about what (if any) ramifications there may be.

That makes you a thoughtful, caring and kind person.  You are right to question what you did, but it would be a travesty if you make yourself suffer for this.

Even if one day the littl'un finds out that the card wasn't written by her own mother's hand, it will be her adopted mother who made the decision to get someone else to write it.  And it may well be that she figured that anyone too close to her might come "under fire" if at some point down the line it came to light that they were part of this (relatively minor) deception.  Whereas you will just be an anonymous person, who spent a long time thinking loving thoughts about this anonymous child.  (Another reason to distance yourself from this co-worker, IMO).

It is not for you to judge them.  Personally, I think that there are reasons why children are given the option to seek their birth-parents at the age of 18, as the tender age of 10/11 is a little young to be handling those kinds of Big issues and emotions.  A 10 year old with the ability to contact her birth-mother at any time is a huge responsibility to lay on her young shoulders.

I don't believe that you have done anything wrong.  I do completely understand how you feel about it, and I have no doubt that I would feel the same way, but I think that you should give yourself a break.  This really wasn't your decision, and you did only what you thought was best.

Learn from this, and if your inner alarm bells go off again, try to buy yourself some time, in the future.  But rest assured, there are lots of occasions in life where you need to make a decision in limited time, and sometimes we all regret those decisions.

Had you not written the card, no doubt your co-worker would have got someone else to do so.  Maybe that someone else wouldn't think twice about it.  The fact that you're this concerned, in my book, makes you a sensitive, thoughtful person, so please let yourself off the hook.

|-| cobq3cy || 3 || I'm very torn about my feelings on this.

Let's forget for a moment that Susan is a certified control freak.  It sounds like you are a nice, friendly person, based on the fact that this woman, a coworker, confides in you and feels she can come to you with something uncomfortable.  Even despite her catching you rolling her eyes at her.

I can think of plenty of people who, in this situation, would lie to this kid or write their own card or tell their kid 'hey, your mom was too busy' or 'your mom is not in town' or 'your mom is a bad person and you shouldn't talk to her...'  You rewrote and simply omitted something, you didn't change what the mother said to her daughter.  And I can somewhat sympathize with wanting to take off the address...the child is at an extremely impressionable age and the birth mom may be a truly suffering person who the child shouldn't try to find and get to know right now.

There is no way to know for sure, and you can't let yourself dwell on it too much.  Like I said, you didn't change the meaning of the card.  It will still mean the world to the daughter if that's all she wanted for her bday.  If you hadn't helped her, I promise Susan would have found someone else or done it herself or just told the kid that the mom didn't write anything. |-| 
|-| cobiiv0 || 8 || Susan sounds like an awful self involved human being. Stay away next time  |-| 
|-| cobl9pb || -3 || Wow. She sounds like a real winner of a mother. She could have just put a damn sticker over the address or something. What kid questions a randomly placed Frozen sticker?
She shouldn't have put you in that situation, and you definitely shouldn't have caved, but you already know that. I think the only way you can feel less shitty about the situation is to confront her about it and tell her not only how wrong it was for her to involve you, but how wrong it is period.  |-| 
|-| cobn5w8 || -4 || I'm not the best person to judge these things by but I'd ask her for $100 bucks to do it. When she refused that I'd ask her for $200 not to tell her daughter about the job I just refused. 

I mean, maybe I wouldn't but that's the first thought that crossed my mind. |-|

|-| cobqlae || 7 || Your OB was right to recommend you to a specialist. While I understand your situation is frustrating, she isn't an incompetent doctor based on this alone. She doesn't specialize in this kind of medicine so therefore may not be as familiar with diagnosing the condition. 

That being said, I'd be mad if my doctor seemed unconcerned about chronic pain. 

This is not life-threatening, so other than the whole "don't eat for 12 hours" thing, follow /u/Deefiant 's advice. Call and get in to get a second opinion with a new doctor. Be pushy without being rude, letting them know you are in pain and under stress to get things figured out. 

Honestly, I work at a vet's office and I'll tell you to be like any of our clients who call us worked up in a tizzy: be firm, and be honest about this being stressful, emotional, and urgent. Usually staff are more than willing to help you out in a crisis if you are nice. 

And if they are not being helpful, you may *insist*. I've had clients straight up be like, "*No*, you're not going to do that, I'd like you to do *this* please." and most of the time I'm like "alrighty then!" |-| 
|-| cobo3py || 3 || Hey I know you're scared but this is a regular procedure. You will be fine and better than before. The recovery sucks but you'll be back to normal in a few weeks if you take it easy. |-| 
|-| cobparo || 3 || I can't help you with any of your health issues, but I can offer some advice on how to proceed next, for what it's worth. 

First, you need to identify three candidates for your new Ob/Gyn tonight. Immediately. Get on your health insurance website, go through the provider list and then do some research. There is no foolproof way to get a "rating" or review for a doctor like you can when shopping for a coffee maker, but there are a few things you can look at. On a website like Health Grades you can consider the doctor's age, gender, specialties (specifically what procedures s/he performs), which hospital s/he has privileges at and what neighborhood the doctor's office is located in. Pick three docs, order them by preference.

First thing tomorrow morning you are on the phone to your top choice's office, requesting a same-day emergency visit. You will be talking to a receptionist who probably knows fuck-all about actual medicine so don't worry about convincing her that you really need the appointment. Use these words if you need to: "My gastroenterologist told me I have a 3*3cm necrotic fibroid cyst with bowel obstruction that requires urgent surgery. I was referred to Dr. V and informed I need to be seen immediately."  Be kind and polite but insistent; if necessary admit that you are scared and in pain.  If you call first thing in the morning you should get an appointment for the same day. If not, take whatever is the earliest appointment they offer for Friday and then move on to Doctor #2.  If Doc #2 gives the same-day appointment, call back and cancel the first one. 

When you get your appointment, make sure to give the Ob/Gyn office the name of your gastroenterologist and ask if there are any special permissions you need to give or steps you need to take to have the results of your CT scan sent to the Ob/Gyn (these vary by state). 

Don't eat after midnight tonight and don't eat or drink anything (even water) prior to the appointment. This is so you are a candidate for same-day surgery. If you've ingested anything in the previous 8-10 hours they will postpone surgery so that you can fast prior to receiving anesthesia.

Lastly, you're going to be fine. Take a shower, wash off that stress and fear, and get some sleep. 

**edit:** Since it seems to be an issue that is causing some confusion, OP was advised that she needs "urgent surgery." In medical parlance, "urgent surgery" is surgery that needs to be performed within the next 48 hours. The term is used to indicate the patient is stable and in no immediate danger but has a potentially life-threatening condition that needs prompt attention. I offered OP the advice I did based on her GE telling her specifically that she required "urgent surgery." I'm frankly surprised that the tiny issue of OP's breakfast has ignited such furor. |-| 
|-| cob2qpy || 29 || &gt; "I'm not at all trying to justify sexual activity with an unconscious person. It's abhorrent to me," Greene said. But he questioned whether sex with an unconscious person should be "rape in every instance — dependent only upon the actor's knowledge that the individual is unconscious. That's the question. That's what I struggle with."

This seems reasonable to me, one wants to be absolutely sure that created legislation isn't too broad. What if someone's kink is giving consent for certain actions to be done to them after taking sleeping pills?

Without questioning a law that predetermines all sexual activity while the partner is unconscious as rape, you've just criminalized a subset of potential actions between two consenting adults. As another rep said in the article:

&gt; "You can have the unintended consequences of being so vague and so broad that we can go backward instead of forward," the Draper Republican said. He later added: "It's an uncomfortable discussion to even have." |-| 
|-| cobj33h || 4 || There was a thread on /r/sex about who enjoyed sleeping sex or being awoken by their partner humping them. It was surprisingly popular. |-| 
|-| cobe1xk || 3 || Depends on how they view consent. I could see some situations where people might not give a crap (passed-out-drunk spouse who has told you in a sober state that they consent?). |-| 
|-| cob3lqb || 14 || These kind of laws make me very uncomfortable since I have sexsomnia (a sleeping disorder that is similar to sleep walking). I wake up 20 minutes into sex they I have initiated and most of the time it's impossible to recognize that I'm asleep (eyes open, verbally responsive). My husband and I have an agreement that if I'm asleep and my sexsomnia kicks in that any sexy times are consentual. I wouldn't accuse my husband of rape for having sex with me during my sleep but I don't trust that other women won't.  |-| 
|-| cob1tr6 || 8 || You need to question everything. There are always extenuating circumstances whether you want there to be or not. I'm glad we have people who can look at something from multiple angles like this, even if they don't necesarily agree with it. |-|

|-| cobd7z8 || 7 || it happened to me. I had an eating disorder, so my hair started to thin. Also as well my period stopped, which is worse. I ate more iron enriched foods and  and it only took 2  month for my hair to become fuller. but really this wrecks your body so please take better care of yourself op. hair thinning is one thing  but make sure your insides the parts you cant see are working right. |-| 
|-| cobdko5 || 3 || I started noticing hair loss in the summer I was about to turn 15. When I went to the doctors they couldn't find anything. I remember they asked me about stresslevels, but back then I didn't think to much about it. Now I see that moving in januari that year caused a lot of stress to me, but back then I didn't realise it so I hadn't really any idea what was happening to me and if I'd ever get my hair back. At the beginning of the new schoolyear it started to become really bad, I had lost like 90% and I allready have very thin hair and not extremely much. I think it was february the next year when it started to grow back, and I got this really weird combination of a few long hairs and tiny curly ones in between. Took a few months to let it grow back to a acceptable length. Now it's normal again, but I know if I ever lose it again I have to rethink if I am not really stressed out. 

I am really glad for you that you found the solution for your hairloss. :) I hope you soon get enough healthy hair back to enjoy your hair again (I know how much I hated not having hair! I had always hated my hair but then I'd do anything to get that damn hair back) Thank you for sharing your problem and solution with us! I'll keep it in the back of my head, must I ever encounter it again.  |-| 
|-| cobf0mf || 3 || I saw a doctor for this a year ago. One big change I made was to take a biotin supplement. The doctor suggested 5000 mcg minimum a day. I had hair loss from PCOS and stress. Now my hair has a lot more volume and the fallout is less than half of what it was back then! |-| 
|-| cobe8oa || -3 || Stop loosening it |-| 
|-| cobqnhb || 39 || It looks like you have three options: deliver and keep the baby, deliver and put the baby up for adoption, or abort.  While not all of those options are likely to guarantee your boyfriend will stick around (particularly the third one), what really matters is the long-term result of this decision.  If you keep it, you're giving up 18+ years of freedom and thousands of dollars, and things may not work out with your guy anyway.  If you put it up for adoption, you'll be free of the obligation, but it will take a physical toll on your body (as any birth does) plus perhaps an emotional toll that you may not expect.  If you abort, it sounds like you'll lose the guy, but that's no different from breaking up when you're 18 for other reasons.

Yes, your boyfriend should have input on the decision, but I believe the final call should be up to you.

Something else to consider that stuck out to me: why does he think the answer is for you to risk your health by carrying and delivering a baby AND move 4.5 hours away AND *drop out of college* while he gets to change absolutely nothing and stay in school himself?  I think if he were actually committed to the idea of a kid with you instead of only opposing abortion for whatever reasons, he ought to be more willing to make some sacrifices himself. |-| 
|-| cobqimo || 8 || Are you in school at the moment? Are there counselors you can talk to in confidence? Or... maybe try planned parenthood. I know they have a hotline you can call about this kind of things. It's a very tough situation... but in the end, it is your body. Please make sure you have support near you, family and/or friends! |-| 
|-| cobrgis || 9 || your body, your life, your choice |-| 
|-| cobsj2o || 8 || Do you want to be a mom? That's the only question here. Do not have a baby to keep your boyfriend. 

He doesn't get to make this decision, you're the one who has to go through with the pregnancy, and if you two break up, guess who gets the baby? That would be you. You won't have a degree, you won't have any work experience, and you'll have a baby. 

If you want to get an abortion, get an abortion. You cannot keep the baby to keep the relationship together, to keep your boyfriend. The baby is not a bandaid, it is not a relationship pawn, it's something that will become a real live human being who lives with you for the next 18 years.  |-| 
|-| cobsca6 || 13 || With all seriousness, suggest to your boyfriend of a month that he drop out of college, move to your area, and raise the child while you finish school and start your career. If his reaction is anything other than "I'm happy to make those sacrifices for the child I alone want. Thank you for being so considerate of my feelings," I wouldn't even consider having a baby *with* him. I would consider having the baby if he wanted full custody, as I think he certainly has am valid claim and is entitled to his opinions. But if he just wants to have his cake and eat it too (by having you take care of the child he wants, sacrificing your wants for his), I would tell him to fuck off. 

Also, think about the best case scenario for how this plays out if you do what he wants and really envision if it's what you want in life. Best case in five years is what? A happy marriage, a cool kid, a great job or finishing up school.  For some people that is the dream. For others, that sounds like hell, especially at 23. If even best case scenario sounds like misery, dont let yourself be guilted or bullied into a life you dont want. But maybe that's your endgame and this is all just happening a couple of years before you'd like.  |-| 
|-| cobql4j || 17 || &gt; Boyfriend wants me to have baby. I want to terminate. 

Having a child is something where both people should be on board, but especially the one who has to carry it to term. This is your choice. Do what you think is right for yourself. |-| 
|-| cobqhve || 12 || If you want to terminate, that's your decision. It is ultimately up to you what to do with your body. Your boyfriend is perfectly valid in having his own beliefs (whether or not they are accurate), but ultimately you can only make this decision with your best interests in mind. Do you want to go live with him while he is in school, getting a degree, while you aren't getting that same opportunity? Not that you can't go to school while pregnant, but it is stressful enough to be pregnant without being in school as well. You are eighteen. This is just the beginning of your adult life. You should not have a kid that you do not want to have. Please see a doctor asap, whether you decided to terminate or not. If you want to terminate, you will have to see how far along you are and then go from there. If you decide to keep the pregnancy, you should start prenatal vitamins and get a general health check to make sure your body is fit and ready for pregnancy.  |-| 
|-| cobq4yk || 15 || Imagine life in 10 years. |-| 
|-| cobs3jl || 5 || He's dumb and you need to do what you think is right.  Ending up broke, divorced and miserable isn't going to be a good environment for a child. |-| 
|-| cobsaaq || 7 || Your body, your rules.  |-| 
|-| cobr66h || 9 || "He says I can drop out of college and move down 4.5 hours to stay with him while he finishes college. I'm not really up for that."

Wow, what a guy :( You drop out, you move, you stay at home with the kid. This seems very one sided. |-| 
|-| cobqufq || 4 || Adoption is an option but awfully hard emotionally.  This is your body and it doesn't really matter what your BF wants.  Terminate as soon as you can, move on with your life and finish your education.  You are waaaay too young to be a parent and deal with all that it entails.  I am even going to go so far as to suggest, since your BF is pro life, just go and get the procedure, do not tell him about it, it will only lead to drama.  Afterwards just tell him you are no longer pregnant.  Of course he's able to indulge his prolife fantasy, it's not his life that will be screwed up, education lost, saddled with providing for and taking care of a needy infant.  Like the Nike ad says, just do it.  This is the same advice I would give my daughter or granddaughter.  fYI I am a 62 yo retired RN with two kids. |-| 
|-| cobrgli || 4 || Two things to consider.

You are pregnant not your boyfriend.  Everything that happens from here on out happens to you.  So, as I said, two things.

What happens to your life if he bails?  What happens to your life if you carry to term? |-| 
|-| cobrjq4 || 5 || Don't ruin your life for someone else, person or fetus. Regardless of what he wants, you don't want it. That's all that matters. You might lose a friend, but the rest of entire life, and all the opportunities to be child free in your youth are worth more than any one friendship. I don't think we (guys) have a significant opinion in a woman's body. |-| 
|-| cobrprk || 5 || I'm glad you're alive! Please stay alive. It's just a pregnancy. People get pregnant all the time, just like people choose to terminate all the time. My wife had an abortion with a man who promised the world, but she knew she was too young, and she's *so happy* that she did.

My feeling is: your body, your life, your future. (My wife actually thinks the man should have a 20% say, but I 100% disagree!) The man has nothing, zero, to do with it, because *you're* the only one physically tied to the child. Men say all kinds of dumb ass shit, some of it in a genuine desire to do the "right thing", but so rarely are those promises actually followed through on.

Make your decision based on *your needs,* and best of luck to you. |-| 
|-| cobrwpf || 4 || You are 18. You have full life ahead of you. Think is this is what you want in life? Managing children can be difficult for full grown adults, let alone 18 year olds

&gt;Neither of us are ready to parents. 

Then don't. Seriously. Your, boyfriend's **and the child's** life would be very difficult.

After you become independent, start earning, can support the child and **yourself** then think about having the baby. |-| 
|-| cobslhm || 5 || What your boyfriend feels about the situation is entirely irrelevant when you -The mother- have already decided that it isn't the right time to FOR YOU to have a baby. You're not doing the baby(Or yourself) any favors by keeping it. 

Don't put your trust and faith in a 18 year old boys word to always be there and to always have you and your kid financially secured. He can't make that promise while still in school. Make sure that if he falls through you have a back-up, such as an education and a well-paid job. You and your BF can always try again when the time is right. 

Stay in school! |-| 
|-| cobu2zi || 5 || I know this is kind of way beyond the point, but I will never be able to wrap my mind around allowing yourself to have sex with someone who has different termination and parenting beliefs from yourself!!

Don't give up your life for this fool. It'll probably be the end of your friendship but do what's right for your life, not what's right for his beliefs.  |-| 
|-| cobua58 || 4 || It sounds like your life would be kind of ruined by having this child. Also, this would tie you to him for the rest of your life. |-| 
|-| cobvxnj || 4 || &gt; I want to terminate.

That's the only sentence in your post that really matters. |-| 
|-| cobraav || 4 || You do you! In this situation, it isn't his choice to make. A child is an extraordinary gift but this stage in your life is all about YOU. The moment you bring a baby into this world you start living for that baby. There's no shame in termination, however there is shame in allowing yourself to be pressured into making such a life-altering move. You know what's best for yourself, don't doubt that for a second! |-| 
|-| cobrgql || 4 || It's your choice. You're the one who will be carrying the child and providing majority of the care for the child. If you want to terminate then terminate.

You may lose your relationship, but if he isn't willing to support your right to choose then it's probably not a relationship that you want to be in anyway. |-| 
|-| cobsfa2 || 4 || The important thing is to decide what is going to be best for *yourself*, no matter what he thinks. I know that's hard, but it's your body and your life, and you're the one taking the risks here. If you think termination is what's best for you, that's what you should do. 

Also, think about how your life would be if you decided to have the baby for him. Are you really going to be happy with the man that forced you into pregnancy? If you go down that road you're probably going to be dealing with a lot of resentment. Plus, you've only been together for a month and you even say you're both not ready to be parents. It's probably not a good idea to keep the baby, just looking at facts. 

There is also adoption, which is something else you have to really think about in order to decide if it's right for you or not. If you're not ready for parenthood, are you ready for pregnancy? Remember, pregnancy is risky in so many ways (physical, financial, emotional, etc.): are you willing to take those risks?  |-| 
|-| cobtu2m || 3 || I agree "your body, your choice", and wanted to add: don't panic (try not to). You have some time to make a decision. Take that time, be centered and calm. Take care of yourself, dear.  |-| 
|-| cobvale || 4 || Absolutely agree with the other comments. A man that wants YOU to drop out of college, basically give up your life and goals, simply because his personal views are against it, does not seem like someone you want to be with long-term. If he is already this rigid and unsupportive, I'd say run.  |-| 
|-| cobqny5 || 6 || If you have the chance to terminate, do so. I love my kids but definitely had them too early. It's hard AF. Enjoy your life. |-| 
|-| cobqcop || 4 || It's a very difficult and sensitive subject, but you truly need to do what's best for you. While your boyfriend deserves a say in the matter, it really is your decision in the end. If you are in no position to raise a child, then don't. Either get an abortion or look into adoption. It would be unfair to go through with the pregnancy and keep the child if you think it would either: 1. Ruin your life or 2. Be very difficult/impossible to keep it. I am very sorry this has happened to you at a time when you neither expected it nor wanted it, and I hope you are able to figure something out. |-| 
|-| cobtxu7 || 3 || &gt;He says I can drop out of college and move down 4.5 hours to stay with him while he finishes college.

I wonder if he'd be willing to drop out of college and come live with you... he can take care of the baby while you finish up schooling. |-| 
|-| cobqjmb || 5 || You have to decide which is more important to you, your boyfriend of a month or the future you planned. I mean, you can still go to college and stuff with a kid, but it's a lot harder and there will be major delays and limitations. This decision is yours and yours alone, and while he of course has every right to express his opinion, he cannot make the decision for you no matter what he believes or why he believes it. 

I have to say that if I were in your shoes, I would not be willing to drop out of college and move 4.5 hours away for him, baby or not. If I were going to carry to term, I would be looking for ways to continue my education with a newborn. Online classes, daycare through the university, WIC and foodstamps since you would have a dependent (depends on location, though, laws vary), more financial aid if your parents are wealth because your FAFSA only considers your income when you have a dependent and not your parents', etc. Better to get your degree while you're there than to wait until it's convenient, which won't be for a long time with a baby and low wage work or being a SAHM for you and probably student loans and an initial entry level job that likely doesn't pay all that much for you boyfriend. All of this is especially true because your relationship is so new and you are so young, and although you've known each other for years, people can be very different in relationships than as friends. I wouldn't be willing to gamble my future career on my boyfriend of one month's dedication to me and our theoretical child. |-| 
|-| cobse7c || -6 || I would recommend not terminating, even if it means some tough life choices.  An unplanned pregnancy seems like a disaster every time, but once the kid comes, you will wonder how you lived without it.  Several little people in my life at the moment started out as "Oh my God, what a fucking disaster!" moments.  But the idea of not having them in my life now is absolutely unthinkable. They will bring problems related to time, money, childcare, fatigue, life style changes, poop and pee-pee, worry, etc.  But all those are solve-able and, honestly, no big deal in the larger scheme of things.  You will wonder how you lived without it after it comes. And nothing says you can't still finish college after the kid comes, though it might take a little longer.    |-| 
|-| cobrm8r || -10 || Having a baby is not the end of the world. It is your body but it is also your boyfriend's baby. He's got a say too. 

Before you do anything, step back think, talk to your parents, talk to your friends. |-| 
|-| cobqio6 || -5 || Go talk to your parents, and talk to his parents - get some advice from your families  |-| 
|-| cobu679 || -4 || Contrary to popular opinion here, I say keep the baby. The whole "your body your rules " thing is kinda unfair toward the father because when you did this, you knew what you were getting yourself into |-| 
|-| cobqxoh || -4 || First off, since it's you and your boyfriend's child, I think you both need to make a decision together involving your child. Now, looking at it realistically  the fact that you're panicking makes me think that a baby would really complicate things right now...but terminating the pregnancy is a huge decision that will clearly be going against your bf's wishes, and I personally think that adoption is what you should do. That way, neither of you gets exactly what you wanted, but an abortion is a very serious decision you might come to eventually regret.. :( Please, have the baby and give it up for adoption:) |-| 
|-| cobjp2d || 7 || The best way to move on is to focus on yourself, and not a relationship. At least not a romantic one. Make some new friends, especially ones that share the same hobbies. Until you can be happy being single, a new relationship isn't going to help. |-| 
|-| cob17ap || 5 || Good vibes comin' your way. I'm not gonna tell you how to live your life or anything, but I'm curious. Did he have an STI while you guys were still together? |-| 
|-| cob1so8 || 11 || I'm just gonna throw something out there - herpes is so common that it's possible that either you or him had to from a while ago, but because of the high stress you're going through, its flared up now. 

Either way, I wouldn't feel guilty about sleeping with your (ex)husband. Shit happens, and divorce is just hard, even when its easy. 

This too shall pass.  |-| 
|-| cobkaop || 4 || Sorry you are going through this.  Stay positive because it's probably nothing.  I lived this situation about six years ago.  From the moment I first heard the word 'abnormal' I could not sleep or focus for a few weeks, until my doctor confirmed negative via colposcopy.  I have amazing friends that helped keep me busy &amp; distract me during this time, but it was still a lonely place to be.  Hope your procedure is soon so can quickly learn that everything is fine :)   |-| 
|-| cobkmna || 4 || I had atypical cells on a pap smear because of HPV and had to get a colposcopy. I also was freaked out about it. They did confirm that they were atypical cells but said that they were not cancerous yet nor were they even close to cancerous because they have to go through several stages of mutations to get to that point. They decided to tell me that it was not even bad enough to have me do the leep procedure which removes the abnormal cells because they thought that my immune system would take care of it. 1 year layer I got another pap smear and no abnormal cells were detected! Don't worry too much, if you are getting pap smears yearly then they shouldn't have had time to progress into something very dangerous. If they have then the leep procedure is supposed to be relatively easy and should clear everything up. Also the colposcopy wasn't very painful, just a bit of pinching, it was a bit worse than a pap smear. I just distracted myself by playing games on my phone. |-| 
|-| cobksta || 3 || Several years ago I had a pap smear come back with atypical cells.  The doctor did a colposcopy, which was slightly painful but manageable, and it showed moderate lesions.  She recommended cryo treatment to freeze off the atypical cells, and follow-up pap smears every 6 months for a couple of years.  I ended up having atypical results again at the follow-up, to which her response was basically ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  I guess she hadn't gotten it all the first time?  So another round of cryo.  At the next check up, yet again, atypical cells.  So I found a new doctor to treat it that time.  After that, my pap smears have been all clean.  It's been about 9 years now.

It was a difficult situation, but it was definitely harder mentally than physically.  Honestly the worst part was dealing with the first doctor.  She never seemed to take my worries very seriously, especially when it kept coming back.  It became 1000x easier when I saw the second doctor who was more responsive to my questions and concerns.  And now that I've been clear for so long, the whole thing is a distant memory. |-| 
|-| coblx7y || 3 || This happened to me during my pregnancy with my daughter.  I completely freaked out so I understand your concerns.  My cells were the "type" that caused cancer as well, and I was upset for days.  Here's the thing-- my cells stayed "abnormal" for a couple of years, then went away.  Now for the last 3 years my paps are normal.  This is what happens for the majority of women.  The key is not to put your head in the sand and not follow up with abnormal results.  Even if your body takes awhile to defeat the HPV, there are many medical ways to prevent it from becoming cancer.  During my years of abnormal results they did a colposcopy and cervical biopsy every year. It wasn't fun, but it gave my doctor the info to know that the cells were NOT cancerous.  I have a friend who has had HPV and abnormal paps for many years (over a decade!)  They are STILL just in the "monitor and wait and see with colposcopy" phase.  I have many, many other friends like myself who had a couple "bad" tests and went on to be fine on their own.  Remember-- "pre" cancerous means NOT cancerous.  It's up to you to take charge of your own health.  As long as you follow your doctors recommendations you will be fine.  Sorry-- hope this wasn't too long... |-|

|-| cobs4ta || 6 || I don't think this has anything to do with the fact that the editor is female. 

The facts:

1)She wrote for an Urdu newspaper which means most of their readers are Muslim, the owner of the magazine is also Muslim. 

2)The Charlie Hebdo Cover is offensive to many Muslims.

3) India has laws against content that harms religious feelings

******************************

**Section 153(A)**

Section 153A of the penal code says,inter alia:

Whoever 

(a) by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise, promotes or attempts to promote, on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, caste or community or any other ground whatsoever, disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities, or 

(b) commits any act which is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities, and which disturbs or is likely to disturb the public tranquility, . . . shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.


**Section 295(A)**

Section 295(A) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) enacted in 1927 says:

Whoever, with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any class of [citizens of India], [by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise], insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of that class, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to [three years], or with fine, or with both.


**Legislative history of Section 295(A)**

A book, Rangila Rasul was published in 1927. The book concerned the marriages and sex life of Prophet Muhammad. On the basis of Muslim complaint, Publisher was arrested but acquitted in April 1929 because there was no law against insult to religion. Publisher was murdered in Court. Muslim community demanded a law against insult to religious feelings. Hence, Colonial British Government enacted Section 295(A).


***************************

4) People were offended by the article and filed a FIR (First Information Report)

5) A First Information Report (FIR) is a written document prepared by police organizations when they receive information about the commission of a cognizable offence.

6) A cognizable offence means a police officer has the authority to make an arrest without a warrant. The police is also allowed to start an investigation with or without the permission of a court. 

7) So the police arrest her (which they can) and release her on 10,000 bail ( $162.00). 

8) She/her children aren't going home because they are scared that someone will attack them.

9) Something similar happened to Salaman Rushide and he/his book was banned from entering India.

10) I know it's fucked up but these laws are sometimes needed to keep the peace in a religiously diverse country, where law and order is  hard to enforce and a large segment of the population is uneducated and reacts to things like this with violence. |-|

|-| cob0mz9 || 5 || VARIETY PACKS!!!!

I'm actually serious, check out undercovercondoms.com. They have really cheap variety packs that come in a bunch of different textures and sizes. Very least I'd keep standards, magnums and magnum XL's on hand just because they aren't that expensive.  |-| 
|-| cob3gbs || 3 || Trojans are a pretty good brand that I've trusted for over a decade without a mishap. Get the kind with spermicidal lubricant if you can (just to add a little bit of a safe guard there).

As to the lubricated kind, just get yourself lube, water based is best. Lubricated condoms are more trouble they are worth unless they have spermicidal lubricant. 

I stick to the classic design but then I have also have my fiancee to have sex with and we go all natural. I see condoms as a pregnancy prevention supplement. The big thing is to get tested with your partners ahead of time. But also keep condoms on hand if you find yourself having a really awesome first, second, third, or fourth date. |-| 
|-| cob6vnh || 5 || Back when I was more actively poly, I kept these on hand:

* Magnums (for some reason, post-divorce I became a big dick magnet)
* Trojan variety packs, non spermicidal

They do have to cover a wide variety, including the only brands for things like IUDs and the implant I think, but for pills, they can exclude some that are considered too expensive or when there's a generic. They can't change her prescription, however, so if they're offering her a generic that they've chosen, it's the exact same pill from a different manufacturer and she should be able to switch without incident. There may be a mild change in side effects because sometimes the delivery system is different, but the active ingredients are the same. |-|

|-| cog825x || 956 || My wife and I were friends with a married couple with children. It came out that the wife was distraught as the husband had been watching porn. (He admitted to me that he had been looking at naked ladies online, nothing more.) According to the wife he clearly had a porn addiction.

As a result she slept with another man as an act of revenge, claiming that his porn viewing was equal to cheating.

|-| cog6382 || 1219 || Another lady chiming in, I am so glad you posted this and I could not agree more! My husband and I have watched porn together and separately. We have always had a sex positive approach to our relationship, there is nothing to be ashamed of! Considering my extremely conservative christian upbringing, it didn't always come naturally to me either. I spent so many years seeing sex as a dirty nasty thing that when I got married, it still felt dirty and nasty. Logically that makes no sense and I had to remind myself of that quite a bit for quite a few years. Now I actually feel the things I would tell myself and I am no longer ashamed. Its sad to me how much many repress their sexuality.  |-| 
|-| cog9h3k || 312 || I just wanna add that a straight up porn addiction is not necessary for it to be unhealthy in a relationship.

|-| coggenx || 101 || I don't know why you would expect to get downvoted for this comment. 

Reddit is majority pro-porn.

It's the people who are anti-porn, or who don't want their partners using it that get downvoted. |-| 
|-| cog72cg || 376 || If porn thrice a week is addiction, then nearly everyone is addicted who isn't a brand-new relationship where you have sex daily. |-| 
|-| cog8h6l || 148 || I think it also depends on the type of porn.  I always considered myself sex positive, but completely felt completely out of my depth in a previous relationship when I discovered my partner had TONS of hardcore BDSM (which I normally have no problem with except some of which seemed really sketchy) on his hard drive.  It turned out he was really into sadism and tried to introduce it into our relationship in very unhealthy ways even after I stated that I was not interested in pain.  

I struggled with being the "sex positive", "this doesn't bother me" girl against my clear discomfort with the situation, and I don't want anyone else to go through that too.

I definitely think that porn can be a positive part of a couple's life, but it's important to remember that context matters.  If you feel uncomfortable with a situation, explore that discomfort, but take your feelings seriously and make sure you're being treated fairly.

Edit: I don't think that being sex positive means being up for anything. I put "sex positive" in quotes because (back then) I was using a warped definition to justify my SOs lack of respect for my boundaries. I was at a low self-esteem point of my life and was trying way too hard to be accommodating. It was manipulative and unhealthy relationship and I think I've learned a lot since then.  |-| 
|-| cogrbky || 9 || What if the original OP (OOP) is against porn and a line was drawn in their relationship in regards to watching it? I didn't see the original post, so gonna have to base my response around yours. 

Sex-positivity seeks to accept any and every sexual act so long as there is consent. The sexual possibilities are endless, **except** for the ones that go against uncritical inclusion. A movement that began in protest to Christian notions of sex and sought to establish that sexual freedom for women is actually sexually repressive. That's the problem I have here. Your post is taking an approach to sex that isolates, and a couple of things define the mindset. The overarching theme is a simplification of people.

*Emotions are waved aside.* It boggles my mind that we can talk emotion and strong preferences for just about anything, but when it comes to sex, there's an undercurrent of fearing being seen as a prude or frigid. Sex is much more than rubbing genitals for some people. Intimacy and emotional connection could be integral, and the sex-postivity movement that is in practice, perhaps unintended, doesn't take that into account. It's like one can't feel too strongly about sexual proclivities because that in itself is gonna infringe on someone else's preferences. What if the personal preference is to feel strongly? The sex-positive movement takes strong emotion and turns it into an automatic judgement. It's created a dichotomy of prude vs. open-minded, right vs. wrong, sexy vs. limp fish. It's killing the nuances of personality and sexuality, ironically. Talk issues out and sort out relationship parameters, but let's not say how someone is feeling is wrong, especially when we're judging it by arbitrary standards as fluid as "sex-positivity". 

*The level of your sexual acceptance determines your open mindedness.* Because no one wants to be a prude, right? Boundaries are mood killers, but let's not forget just how *sexy* consent is, which ties back to being "open-minded". Is there really true consent if the alternative to anything other than an enthusiastic yes is that you're a Puritan who don't know how to let loose? Consent is so loosely defined and relative, where's the line? What about acts between a child and adult where there was consent? Uncritical appraisal of sexual expression wouldn't account for those situations. The movement's done more to impose ridiculous standards and expectations of sexual satisfaction than to truly be inclusive. Want proof of that? Say you're anti-pornography and wouldn't tolerate the habit in a partner, and watch the reactions. Your post is full of that. This isn't addiction, and perhaps it doesn't fit the DSM-V parameters of addiction, but his viewing is affecting their relationship, and that's cause for and worthy of concern. Again, I can only go off of your post. 

*Sex just isn't complicated, obvs.* Breaking it down in crass terms, heterosexual sex is someone entering the body of another. That's not supposed to be monumental for anyone at all? Degrees of intimacy, jealousy, possessiveness, and self worth can be present, just as for some that those might not be a factor at all. How those emotions and states are expressed is what we should be talking about. Retaliation isn't the answer to jealousy or being uncomfortable with a sexual preference. Have a discussion, establish AND respect boundaries, or even go separate ways. Seek counselling, whatever, but again, dismissing those feelings isn't okay. 

*Preferences exist in a vacuum.* Oh, it's all a fantasy anyways, let's not read too much into it. This is an extreme example, but I've already spent way too much time on this. A young teen abuses and kills animals for fun. Evaluations done on him would indicate that he has a budding propensity for criminal behavior. Statistically, most violent offenders have a history of animal abuse. That, in turn, is a behavioral trait commonly found in serial murders. The same critical thought and deference given to patterns and symptoms in nearly every other topic isn't applied to sex. We don't choose sexual orientation, but sexual preferences and inclinations **are** societally conditioned. Learned associations, conditioned behavior. So then to say that pornographic preferences aren't anything to raise an eyebrow at is intellectually dishonest. And this is ignoring, for the sake of brevity, the hugely unethical and dehumanizing nature of the sex industry, an uncomfortable truth that's quickly dismissed in favor of the sex workers who find fulfillment in their work. 

Your post makes it wrong to raise objections. One of the problems of these movements, aside from how quickly they permeate society and even more rapidly are subconsciously adapted to, is that the focus is on being able to say yes, but brush under the rug (often implicitly, to be fair) the option to refuse. Maureen Dowd commented, "Now we have bimbo feminism, giving intellectual pretensions to a world where the highest ideal is to acknowledge your inner slut" (I'm uncomfortable with the usage of "slut"), and please, if that's what floats one's boat, I'm not standing in the way. Just don't stand in my way when I say I want something else. 

OOP's husband should hone in on why his wife was unhappy with him watching porn, in the same way that she should seek to understand why he lied. That's a balanced approach that acknowledges both parties feelings.  |-|

|-| cogkm2m || 14 || There are many people who's sexual gratification is linked directly to their partner and partner only, the same way that their are people who have and want many partners. It is ignorant to think your way is the only healthy way. What she needs is a compatible partner, someone who has a drive and mentality similar to hers, not someone to tell her she's wrong and he's right. I agree 3 times a week is not an addiction, but to someone who is entirely monogamous, physically and emotionally, then it can seem that way. You are asking her to accept something, that to her, feels really wrong. The same way asking a monogamous person to be in an open relationship would feel really wrong to them also. Changing what feels wrong is no simple feat, and sometimes impossible. You are asking her to change her values in order to align with yours and his, and I don't think that is fair. |-| 
|-| coggn1o || 8 || Uh. Has anyone asked how much sexual healing, (the or a)  person in question receives, from their partner? Before we ask if it's a problem ? |-| 
|-| cogg6ol || 24 || The amount of time spent watching porn doesn't necessarily mean that he isn't addicted. While it may seem like a small amount to you, time spent is only a very small part of what constitutes addiction. The question is, how much does he rely on it to manage his emotions and life. An addict uses the substance they are addicted to to manipulate their emotions. For some people, that means binging on it. For others, they go longer periods of time in order to create tension. It's called a ritual, and each addict has a different one. I was with a partner who went months in between, but went into binges when he did. He wasn't capable of seeing either me or himself as anything more than a sexual object and it took dealing with his porn, masturbation, and objectification addiction in order to change that.

Other than that, using porn may be outside of this woman's values system, both for herself and her partner. And while that might not be a popular value, it doesn't make hers any less legitimate. Obviously that's an agreement they need to come to between the two of them if he disagrees. The fact that he lied about it makes it impossible for them to do that. (In this area, I agree with you. The dishonesty would be a bigger issue for me than the porn. But that's my values system and not hers.) For me, my desire to be in a porn free relationship mainly stems from the human trafficking issues that are involved with pornography production. I can't be comfortable with them, and I cannot be comfortable being with a partner who doesn't consider those issues to be more important than their desire for sexual stimulation. Fortunately, my partner agrees. 

I agree with you that she could probably benefit from counseling. However, I think she should see someone who is experienced in working with sexual betrayal. While others may not see his behavior as sexual betrayal, she clearly does and that is what is most important in looking for help.

|-| cogm37f || 23 || I have such mixed feelings about this. 
To me, personally
I dislike porn. This type of thing is not for everyone.
Some people are cool with it. I am not one of those people. 
I don't find people who watch it to be perverted or disgusting 
But I think it has it purposes...

I am in a 5 year relationship with someone who I love and have children with.
I am physically attracted to him and he claims to be to me.
But that's where it's fucky.
I would have sex every. Single. Day. 
Twice if he would. 
I would never want to toot my own horn... but I am not ugly.
His friends are even quite confused by the fact that he will choose porn over me... 
I will do everything in my power to try to get him in the mood
I'll even start first thing in the morning being attentive or frisky 
But he will tell me to go to bed so he can finish a show if I seem tired
And I wake up and he has been jerking off to porn 
I am not against masturbation 
it's normal and healthy and all that stuff
But if I am with someone who I love and am attracted to and who claims to have mutual feelings 
Why does he choose porn over me?? 
He doesn't even have an answer... he doesn't know
My needs remain unmet constantly 
And he looks up videos of girls he finds attractive and jerks off to them.
It hurts my feelings terribly and makes me feel sick to my stomach.
I offer myself to him
But he doesn't accept it 
It's enough to drive you into depression.
He will make me think all day long that there may be a chance to get some attention
But then he doesn't bother 
For whatever reason ... porn is what he wants over me
Yet he wouldn't want me to get attention from another man. I'm quite torn and confused 
Things are always happy and pleasant and we get along and are a great team 
And I feel in love and connected with this guy
But... he likes that porn. And it makes me sad |-|

&gt;The Construction of the Porn Text


POP is not an easy film to watch, because it uncovers the way that porn production involves the sexual abuse of women. Rather than taking the finished edited text as a given entity, the filmmakers interview a number of female porn performers who explain, in graphic detail, what happens to them when making porn. In one particularly informative scene, a porn performer describes the system of payment for each act. She explains that the more penises inserted into her body at any one time, the more money she makes. The matter-of-fact delivery, together with the story from a second porn performer, who talks about feeling disgusted by the men who consume her images, disrupts the taken-for-granted notion that women in porn end up there because they love having sex. Instead, these scenes reveal the way that porn is, for these women who have few career options – one of the few opportunities to earn more than minimum wage.

In order to illustrate to the audience that the filmmakers did not cherry-pick the worst of the porn to make their case, they interview Dr. Ana Bridges, who was the lead researcher on a large quantitative content analysis of contemporary porn. In their 2010 study, Bridges and her team found that the majority of scenes from fifty of the top-rented porn movies contained both physical and verbal abuse targeted at the female performers. Physical aggression, which included spanking, open-hand slapping, and gagging, occurred in over 88 percent of scenes, while expressions of verbal aggression—calling the woman names such as “bitch” or “slut”—were found in 48 percent of the scenes. The researchers concluded that, if both physical and verbal aggression were combined, 90 percent of scenes contained at least one aggressive act.

The film shows footage of how a scene is constructed and the way the woman’s body is manipulated for the camera. We watch a woman being trained how to arch her back and to perform oral sex. And we see, in stark form, a woman retch after a particularly abusive act. Some of the footage includes scenes that are often edited out of the final version, so the audience is privy to the way the women feel after the scene is over. One example is a woman who has just been ejaculated on by 13 men. In the film she is depicted as loving it, but the post production footage shows her saying “gross” and cringing because she is covered in ejaculate. This deconstructing of the text helps students appreciate the degree to which porn is less a documentation of reality than an edited, stylized representation that is ideological in the way it depicts sex, gender, heterosexuality, and relationships.

|-| cog6fty || 59 || Should chime in here that current thinking does not list excessive porn use as an "addiction". This is a learned behavior that requires slightly different treatments if it is a real problem. Also, labeling something as an addiction can lead to a shame spiral that leads to deeper concealment of activities.  |-| 
|-| cog8lpq || 17 || Porn in most contexts is fairly new. Women have not dealt with this issue in past generations to this extent.

Your fathers and fathers fathers masturbated to magazines or catalogs or illustrations for as long as we have had some type of media to do it with.

|-| cogl79a || 9 || For anyone with this problem, I recommend /r/pornfree (over /r/nofap even). Masturbation shouldn't be vilified, particularly not during the process of overcoming porn addiction. It just sets the addict up for failure. NoFap should be treated as a bonus goal. Nice to strive for, but not the end of the world if not achieved. Overcoming the *porn* addiction is the real point.

Source: Struggled for over a year with nofap. Switched to pornfree, and I'm now almost 4 months free of any porn (113 days), with a loving girlfriend. As a consequence I also quit masturbating as a side choice to help with healing my desensitization, but that happened naturally this way, instead of forcing both at once, which can be overwhelming.

This problem is going to be more and more common. You're not alone. |-| 
|-| cogm2q5 || 10 || I believe pornography and addiction to pornography and sex is becoming a serious problem with marriages and even singles in my personal experience and in discussions with others.  The prevalence and ease at which average persons gain access through tubes, torrents, and pop-ups, and even craigslist and newsgroups is the ugly big elephant in the room that no one wants to admit.   I've been taught through study and therapy that addictions don't feed on the actual act but the lack or fear of something else.  You were abused, you're afraid to admit someone or something you hurt, you can't act like a responsible adult and are passive, or you are a control freak and can't stand when things don't go your way.  These are many but not all inclusive of a list of underlying issues that drive us all into the fantasy of addiction, the escape from the pain, the fear, and loss of control.  In my case, with a passed experience of abuse from baby sitters, parents fear of discussing sex, and their own broken and sexless marriage leading eventually to divorce all made for a toxic combination experiences contributing to the completely dysfunctional view of sex, relationships, love, and a great deal of other things.  

I didn't like the taste of alcohol so alcoholic is out, I didn't like drugs (I saw my sibling go down that road, and didn't want to repeat that), so porn is what I used to escape  the sexless marriage of 20 years that I had entered into.  It wasn't just sexless, it was loveless as well, there was no intimacy whatsoever, sure there's the daily "I Love You, and kiss"  There was no cuddling, no holding, heck not even sleeping in the same bed.  

It didn't just stop there with porn.  I used porn daily when alone in the house or not, sometimes 4 to 6 times a day if I were alone.  Many times there wasn't even any ejactulate just the sensation and that's what I became addicted to the sensation and the visual simulation.   It eventually got to the point where I wouldn't even need the visual, I could just use my mind in the shower.  Yet that wasn't even enough.  I started branching out, seeking those fantasy experiences with others I could meet through yahoo messenger, yahoo groups, and then eventually craigslist, and badoo.  There was no sexual genre that was too taboo.  I did have standards, attraction, and I was opposed to children, animals and body waste but I didn't turn down any consenting adult regardless of sex and gender, as long as it was safe and didn't leave any marks.

It's not easy living with myself and I have gotten help with support groups and therapy.  The biggest help has been knowing there are others I can talk to who are in the same boat, that I'm not alone, and a healthy belief in a higher power (In my case God) but that's not for everyone.  I'm not perfect and I've come to realize there is a great deal out of my control and I have learned to accept a great deal that's thrown my way.  

I'm not saying that porn is the devil or evil.  I think in certain applications it could be helpful (not in my case) and when it combined with self arousal replaces something natural and healthy like a partner then it becomes a problem.  In my case at least and I believe great deal of others as well.  The shame, and fear that accompanies it should be a telling sign to anyone.  If you can't openly discuss it and both agree on it in honesty then there's a problem that needs to be addressed.  Just my perspective, nothing to fret about if you don't agree with it.

EDIT:  There are quite a few women I've meet who are in this same boat, it's not as frequent but there is a much larger stigma attached to it which drives women to not admit a porn or sex addiction. |-| 
|-| cog6h4e || 52 || I think it is understandable that some women would react to porn negatively. They might have issues with inadequacy or not want to be compared sexually with someone who does that. They may not want to be requested some of the things that happen in it. It all comes down to respect in a mutual relationship. A couple needs to respectfully develop the knowledge of what both partners like and if that's not enough for one partner then sexual fantasizing is a fair alternative that should be known about by the other partner, allowing them the knowledge that it is happening and if they want they can further compromise. 

This is all an opinion by the way. I know I say should a lot but it's just what I think. That said, I'm not immune to scrutiny.  |-| 
|-| cogfev2 || 17 || With all due respect, I understand your perspective, but two people should enter into a relationship with complete understanding of what they want from the other person.

|-| cogfhbx || 25 || I don't want to be a stick in the mud or anything, but I have literally struggled with porn addiction.  No matter how mild it may seem to some.  Maybe once or twice a month I get sooo overcome with the urge to watch porn that there is nothing I can do to stop myself from getting on the internet and watching it for a couple hours.  It used to be a lot more often when I was younger.  You see, this is a major problem I've dealt with for many years.  I am 26 and I've had this addiction since I was 11.  I've tried many things to quit, ridiculous things, often and in great excess.  I've read books and different ways to keep it from overtaking me so completely.  

As much as people want to say "twice a month is not an addiction" I will strongly disagree.  To me, it is an addiction.  I often wonder what it is like for people who do not struggle with this.  I don't think there is anything wrong with a woman who wants to be respected and have her body be the only one the SO looks at naked.  Why should a woman have to compete for your attention?  If a man does not watch porn does he get the desire to relieve himself on a woman's face, spit, do anal, tie her up and hit her inappropriately?  No, this is brought on by porn.

More importantly, the more people watch certain types of porn (i.e. dom, child, drug, drunk, upskirt etc) then more women or men are paid to do it or even worse, imprisoned to do it.  There are so many children being bought, sold, and exploited for sex slavery.  None of this is "natural" as people like to say porn is part of life and should not be shamed.  To this I say, no way.  I am an addict and I hope to quit one day.  The whole thing disgusts me because I have a daughter and I want her to know there is a man out there who will respect her enough to only care for her body.  I want her to trust her husband and feel comfortable being herself with him and not worrying if she looks as good as the girls he loves watching masturbate on the internet.  THIS IS MESSED UP.  

Not all of you share the same concerns I do and that is okay.  My whole point was to say that there are negatives to it and I don't think a woman should feel ashamed if she does not like her husband watching porn.  This is purely my perspective and not intended for arguments or public shaming or whatever. |-|

|-| cogiut1 || 4 || I consider my ex-husband to have been a porn addict. He would watch 4-5 hours most nights, usually from 1am-5 or 6am. He was a pastor and claimed he didn't want to look at it, so he asked me to put an Internet filter on our PC. It also kept a record of what sites he was looking at and at what times, what search terms he used, etc. 

He would watch porn and play games on his Playstation instead of looking for a job. If I happened to walk into the room while he was watching, it literally was as if I wasn't there. He also, in my opinion, was a compulsive masturbator. He'd do it in the car while driving alone, at his grandparents house in the guest room, we'd even be late to things because he just wouldn't stop. He was 45 minutes late to his own birthday party because he just wouldn't stop masturbating. I was always worried our two year old was going to walk in on him.

When we divorced, I was given copies of all of his credit card and bank statements. Within one 24 hour period he subscribed to two porn sites and...Christian Mingle, ha! |-| 
|-| cogm4ao || 4 || A very thought provoking point you made above. Though I know porn addiction can be destructive but watching it sparingly on your own shouldn't equates to cheating. I find that thinking bizarre, to say the least. |-| 
|-| cogsxh1 || 4 || Loved reading all the replies. Only wish is I could see and talk in person about it cause I think it tells more about the thoughts. 

Anyway, as a porn viewer and follower of Jesus I have some thoughts from fused beliefs from non Christian and now Christian beliefs. 

Growing up I never was taught in church sex was bad but a beautiful thing between two people. Porn obvisouly was a big no no but we were never shamed for "slipping" for we are human and gods grace is always there

With my virginity long gone I have come around to the belief that it's just not a productive part of our lives, with out the confines of religion we have never been wired to view it. For today's porn is a "new" human product. 

For me, taking jesus out of the equation I always get this sense that porn isn't productive in a relationship because if you can control your desires through the day or however long it is between sexy times you can have much better fucks because you can just let your fantasies explode from it all being pent up. 

The problem is, people do take societies/religions standards to a degree that confines your freedom of life. When your with some one in that setting the intimacies is so overwhelming that if you just let those release when ever you get a rock hard boner (im male so I use male versions cause I like them better) than the intimacy of it all slowly drops. 

I like masturbatipn cause I'm training to hit the ceiling one day but that's cause i want to have that intimacy with my wife to be crazy and wild and just part of who we are so i hope I never need to release it when I'm alone. 

I'm young and dumb so take everything I said with a cup of salt cause I'm still learning but I think sex is so much more. Even if you take religion away from it, I think because of how we are wired we are so much more than watching random people online bone. Obvisouly  some one had to have the thought of shitting on someone's chest before making the film so I think that being said means you don't need it to create that intimacy. 

(Fyi, I'm taking a grammar course in college right now so hush your tushies about it) 

Just my thoughts. Loved the responses though.

Great talk on the effects of porn.

Quite simply, your brain wasn't designed to handle that many hot chicks at a time. After a certain amount of exposure, it dulls the other areas of your life, such as having sex with an actual woman. |-| 
|-| cogeiqv || 19 || I fight with this train of thought often. Mostly because my boyfriend isn't affectionate unless I'm crying and severely upset. To me it feels like he is cheating on me when I just want him to hold my hand once in a while but he goes off to the wonder of the internet to look at prettier girls. I feel cheated on an emotional level. Like, how dare I have to beg for a simple peck on the cheek or a hug when I'm upset but this hussy on the internet gets more attention than I do! 

I tell him why I'm upset and that I rather not see him do it in front of me. Still angers me when I catch him doing it because I end up feeling neglected. :/ |-| 
|-| cogn190 || 9 || Just going to leave this here: http://fightthenewdrug.org/ Great site, it focusses on the measurable effects of pornography and leaves out whether it is morally right or wrong in and of itself. 

Do we LIKE porn? For most humans, the answer is yes. But that has nothing to do with whether it is good for us or not. Our society once loved smoking cigarettes. It was a "cool" thing to do. Less cool, now that we have directly observed the harmful effects over time. Hopefully the same thing happens with pornography. Unfortunately, for those of us who idolize sex and see it not as a healthy part of life but as a necessary component to our identity and happiness, we will probably fight tooth and nail to normalize it. 

Will porn ruin every relationship it touches? Of course not. Not every smoker dies of lung cancer. But should we be teaching our kids that cigarette smoke is a perfectly acceptable thing to put into our bodies? 

OP is also making an arbitrary distinction as to what is and is not an addiction. "3 times a week is not an addiction." I respectfully suggest that if that person NEEDS those 3 times a week and reacts negatively to missing those times, they are addicted by definition. The dictionary defines "addicted" as: "physically and mentally dependent on a particular substance, and unable to stop taking it without incurring adverse effects". 

TL;DR: Please, don't use pleasure as the exclusive determinant for what is good for you. No one likes getting shots - but we still vaccinate our kids. |-| 
|-| cogio85 || 3 || Hello! 
I was just wondering if you (or anyone) could help me. I don't have a lot of relationship experience or experience with men in general. Or people in general. I'm a bit of a loner. But I've posted about how it upsets me that my boyfriend watches porn on Reddit before and I got some really good answers! However, a poster brought something to my attention. He said his girlfriend didn't like him watching porn because she thinks she should be the only girl he seeks to see naked. Before I'd read that, I wasn't sure what I didn't like about my boyfriend viewing it. I just felt uncomfortable and jealous and sad. I kind of agree with his girlfriend though. I do admit that I would like to be the only female my boyfriend purposefully seeks to see naked. I have no problem with my boyfriend masturbating and he's always been very honest with me about his porn. I was just hoping one of you could give me a new perspective. I really, really want to be a cool, chill girlfriend that doesn't care about her boyfriend watching porn.  |-| 
|-| cogv5d5 || 4 || I think a big issue other people miss is this:   
   
I dont have a problem with masturbating or pornography but I do have a problem with the porn industry. Im worried I could be contributing to explotation. Is there like a fair trade version of porn I can consume? |-| 
|-| cogw85u || 3 || Let me get one thing straight before I say anything. I'm a 22 year old male, and a porn addict, and have been for 8 years. I'm in for it until I am dead.

However, just because I have a problem with porn doesn't mean others can enjoy it. It's like alcohol. One person may be able to enjoy a pint, then continue with their day, the other will keep on going until blackout, then wake up and continue, day after day. I disagree with porn, as I see it as unhealthy, and I see it much like smoking was, i.e everyone thinks its healthy and good for you, but it ends up being terrible for you, mentally and physically. I hope to see that I am proven right in the future, but people can watch porn with no proven consequences, and some like me can't. 


 |-| 
|-| cogsxie || 9 || This is an unfair response, even if it was meant in good intent. If someone doesn't want a partner who watches porn they don't need to learn to accept 'healthy sexuality' bullshit like this. 

Why does everyone insist on excusing behavior that hurts a partner?

I don't want the person I'm with to think of another person sexually and the person I'm with doesn't want that either so we don't watch porn or fantasize of other people.

Why? Because we love each other. We want sex as a result of an intimate bond and that in love feeling to never leave to only grow deeper. We don't want other people. Period. We want the real thing and that's what we work on making happen everyday.

I would rather be alone than have to deal with wondering if every time I turn my back my SO is undressing another woman mentally. There's nothing loving in a partner who does that. 

I'm tired of this intellectualizing of emotion and over sexualization that has taken hold of almost everything. Porn hurts relationships I don't give a fuck what anyone says. |-| 
|-| cogfg09 || 9 || There is nothing morally wrong with watching porn but I do feel that it is too much of a good thing. Look at how the no fap community has expanded in the past year. The male brain is geared towards sexual novelty and high speed Internet can give us more novelty than is ever possible in the real world. Not watching porn isn't repressing your sexuality it is taking control of an urge. If you really want to watch people having Sex go do that in real life, if you are uncomfortable with that then why is watching pixels on a screen so awesome to you? |-| 
|-| cogr6mw || 7 || These comments are full of so much B.S. Say what you want about the morality of watching porn, but the science is in and the results say that porn is not good for you mentally, physically, emotionally or socially.  |-| 
|-| cogchpq || 4 || The only time porn  is a problem is when I get home and boyfriend isn't "up" to go again. Lammmmmmme. |-| 
|-| cogcgva || 23 || This is my personal experience and my personal opinion so please do not attack me because I may not think like you.
I am an opposer of porn. I do not like it and I do not think that it is healthy. It honestly baffles me that people think that watching people have sex in videos (and other sources of pornography) is healthy but if people were to watch each other in person it would be weird/unusual. 
I believe that sex is healthy and relieving oneself is healthy. I think that if the only way for someone to relieve themselves is to do it on their own then I can understand the use of porn. But on the contrary if you have another person who is willing to relieve you and fulfill any fantasy that porn could give you why would you continue to use it, especially if your SO is not comfortable with porn. I can't understand why someone would forgo physical interaction with another person for something that isn't real, unless they are not being physically satisfied.
From my personal experience with my SO pornography is a problem. In the beginning of our relationship he had told me that he never used porn, he just wasn't that type of person but on multiple occasions throughout our relationship I have caught him and he has lied. In these particular situations I was of course way more upset about the blatant lies than I was about the porn usage, though it was still something that bothered me. Before you call me insecure I can say that yes as someone who has previously been in abusive relationships before that I am insecure and I'm working on myself for the betterment of me and my relationship (though that is not where my aversion to porn stems from) But how does one feel secure about their body and sexuality when you feel like your SO is choosing to watch other people (who are physically unrealistic) rather than have you? 
This is my take on why many women do not feel comfortable with their SO using pornography
Here also comes the double standard. While many people consider watching porn harmless and/or healthy many also feel differently about their SO using it personally as well. Like another person had stated in this thread while one person uses porn they feel uncomfortable with their SO using porn or using sex toys
My relationship might just be really fucked up but I can't help but think I'm not the only person who deals with such double standards.  |-| 
|-| cog56s1 || 53 || I'm glad that you as a woman understands that. As a male I couldn't agree more on all your point on viewing of porn. Just wished my wife felt the same way as you. |-|

|-| cogrj8c || 7 || And yet another lady... I'm not sure if porn addiction was ever an issue - probably not.  But porn had a huge negative effect on my sex life.  I knew my ex was turned on by it and even watched some with him during our early days (we lasted over 20 years!).  I never monitored him or had reason to believe he watched a lot of porn, but it wasn't long before I understood he ONLY knew how to have "porn sex".  No amount of love, explaining, guiding, communicating ever got him to do anything other than what he had had learned to do as a teen -- namely, masturbate to porn.  I was simply his masturbatory aide performing "live" for him.  OK from time to time, but not what a good sex life is built on. Yawn.  Addicted or not, porn does affect the way people (men) learn and practice sex and it is not pretty. |-| 
|-| cog6shf || 38 || It’s great that some couples can feel comfortable having porn be a part of their relationship. The key is being open to what you're both comfortable with because yeah, there are a good number of women with no issues regarding porn. But putting it simply, porn is mostly made by men for men. And, while it’s so commonplace and accepted nowadays, that doesn’t necessarily make it ok. If you’re single, sure, watch as much porn as you want. 

But here’s a reason why a woman would have a problem with porn: When you’re in a serious monogamous relationship, you want your significant other to desire you and you only + you want your significant other to be intimate with you and you only. When men watch porn, it can feel like cheating because in that moment he’s desiring whatever he’s watching. He’s getting off to whoever that chick is. And that chick is not you. That chick is also probably a million times hotter or even younger than you are. It doesn’t matter if he forgets about her 10 seconds after he comes. What matters is the element of desire and extending an intimate act to another person.

Obviously, it can hurt knowing that your significant other is getting off to a woman you can never be. But we aren’t going to talk about how porn generates feelings of inadequacy for women. And it’s not necessarily a matter of feeling insignificant – I mean, you wouldn’t want to know your wife thinks about other men or desires other men when you have sex with her right?

|-| cogipkw || 3 || As a Christian who grew up in a conservative home, I will throw my two cents in. I grew up hearing that masturbation was bad, and I thought I was somehow messed up, since I had a high sex drive and needed to help myself out often. 

My husband is the one who encourages me to explore my sexuality and bought me my first toy. Our sex life really flourished once we started openly talking about it and stuff. |-| 
|-| cognc3l || 4 || Only time I was ever mad at a SO watching porn was when I knew he was watching it, but every time I wanted to have sex he suddenly had erectile dysfunction. I feel like, at that point, I was a little justified in being upset that he could get it up for some girl with a shitty boob job and not for his girlfriend. Dick. But after the situation got exponentially worse I finally realized that shaming him constantly wasn't going to make me more desirable, it was going to make him retreat even more. Turns out questioning a guy's manhood isn't the biggest turn on. So I tried being candid and respectful towards him and talking about the issue bluntly (because porn itself is never the issue, it always represents a larger issue). And we worked it out!

Sidebar, let's stop calling our female peers whores if they sleep with what we consider too many people (or the wrong people). Let's stop saying "I don't want a daughter because I don't want to deal with all the guys chasing her around," etc and instead embrace the idea of raising a daughter and teaching her how to have a responsible sex life. If we encourage girls to not fear sex then they may not fear sex.

|-| coge9g5 || 7 || What someone said earlier, there nothing wrong with masturbation, but you don't need porn for that. It's very selfish, and disgusting to think that people feed off attention from other people who can seem to have self control over looking at other bodies. The whole idea of porn is fucked, and I honestly don't understand people why make it out like it's nothing bad when there's more to it that people don't want to see. I used to look at it, but I realise how messed up it was. I wasn't actually appreciating a body for what it really was. It's has a lot of negative effects, but people fail to acknowledge them. 
 |-| 
|-| cog9haz || 8 || They are most likely more angry at the comparison he is making in what he sees in porn and what he gets at home.  From the looks of the actors, to things being done.  He may not say it, but people do compare.  Just my 2 cents... |-|

|-| cogftmy || 5 || mine lied about porn for years and it became a crazy addiction. turns out, he was gay. (no i'm not making this up), which explained a lot of his distaste for me (considering i'm a fitness model and bikini competitor) but passion for his many hard drives of porn.... that being said, an addiction is not a few times a week. an addiction is your husband or S/O being so selfish about it that it consumes any free time. someone who comes home, kisses the baby and hops on the computer alone for hours. someone who is so numb to your feelings about missing intimate time together that they will watch it on your own laptop and then not even care anymore that you open it to that shit. someone who is so addicted they have apps on their phone, photos in their car, and use your extra external HD for more. someone who makes you feel so small because they never ever look at you or ask you for anything anymore but spend every free moment on the computer looking at other women (and men in my case). that's an addiction. 
it's very hard to help women - especially women who grew up in a very conservative culture - understand that men genuinely do dissociate when they watch porn. that being said, my only "rule" in my now-very-healthy new relationship two years removed from my ex husband is that he doesn't watch anyone he or i know personally (a girl he went to highschool with is a porn star which is where this one came from) lol. otherwise... he's moderate and we have a killer sex life, he never lies about it and i'm fine with it. 

edit: the "he" i'm referring to in the end is my current boyfriend &lt;3 in case unclear, i divorced the gay ex. lol. |-|

|-| cogr7ih || 3 || I normally don't sign in, but for this I have to comment.If this lady believes that her husband watching porn is considered cheating than it is considered cheating. If she feels that it has interfered with her relationship in any way shape or form and might believe he has an addiction than let her call it what she thinks it is. Everyone's level of addiction and definition is different. I understand OP's way of saying it as warm intentions , but it still sounds like your knocking how this person's feeling. If my husband looked at porn I would consider it cheating and its no one's decision if its "extreme".  I'm pretty sure her husband knew how his wife was and that's why he hid what he was doing. I just hope she is okay.  |-|

|-| cogkuju || 3 || i'm a guy, who has somewhat been on the opposite end of this dilemma. first off, /u/burnerbabyburn, thank you for posting this to whomever it was directed towards. you may have saved a marriage.

without getting into too many of the messy details, i was married for 8 years (technically 9 i guess) and will be divorced in about 2 weeks. i married someone who was very conservative, has a kind of naive innocence about her, and would do anything for her husband - all qualities i valued in her.

i would not say i've ever been addicted, but i have looked at porn since i was 9 years old and masturbated since then. it's a large part of my sex life. i spent many years suppressing sexual fantasies in an effort to force myself to be the kind of husband she wanted - it was wrong of me to do, but it's what i did. 

about 2 years ago i grew exhausted from this. i was seeking out ways to explore those desires without cheating on my wife, eventually coming to the conclusion that i needed to be honest with her and hope for her support. give her personality, i feared the worse would happen, but owed it to her to be straight forward and give her the benefit of the doubt. 

to be incredibly straight forward - she left me strictly because of sexual beliefs and desires. she was appalled by the fact i look at porn, and as i attempted to disclose other much more personal things (such as having an interest in bdsm) she simply could not take it and left.

i bring this up simply to say, to whomever this post was directed to (if they're reading), that your response to your husband is everything. my wife's response to me has been very damaging. when you finally open up to your spouse about something - something you have held back for years, and years - and do not gain their support; their love; or even their confidentiality... it takes a brutal toll. 

so, please, for the sake of your husband and your marriage, be careful. just, be careful. you do not have to change what you believe for someone else, ever, but it's important to resolve those conflicts. it's important not only for your marriage and yourself, but for the well-being of the person you love.

good luck. |-| 
|-| coguk06 || 3 || This topic is my life right now. 

Was married to a porn addict for 10 years. Before marriage, we agreed that porn was off-limits for both of us. Turns out he had a horrible addiction that he kept secret. I found about it after the wedding, and the next 9 years of marriage were a constant cycle of catching him, lies, half-assed attempts to recover via 12-step programs, and counseling. He watched porn in  a work bathroom for hours with a company laptop- everyday for years. He watched porn on his phone and jerked off in Public bathrooms, he started doing it in his car while he was driving, he began to obsess over certain teenaged girls we knew and started texting them. He lost the job. We had to sell our home. I took our young son and I left him. So for all you out there who don't think it's an addiction, I get where you're coming from, but you're wrong. I was skeptic so as well, until I watched a man's life unravel because he could not stop watching porn to cope with his emotions.  |-| 
|-| cog8alz || 4 || 3 times a week is laughably infrequent. If she wants to claim dominion over his life and not allow him to relieve himself a few times a week then he needs to break up with her and pursue a relationship that's more accommodating. |-| 
|-| cogm43l || 4 || Someone not liking porn doesn't make them not sex positive. Pornography is so harmful to women in how it's made and how it depicts them. You can have a full sex life without watching porn. My boyfriend and I both oppose porn for these reasons. You're not a prude for not supporting porn - it's a fantasy world built upon the drugging and abuse of young, troubled women. We need to stop equating sex with porn because they're not the same. |-| 
|-| cog6p16 || 3 ||  You say: "His lying to you is fucked. He should never had lied"

Then you ask: "Do you consider masturbating cheating?"

I do not know too many women that openly admit that they masturbate. Even though a lot of women do it...they still would hide or try to knock down how often they really do it. 

What difference would it make then if you are lying about how many times you watch porn, or how often you masturbate?
For people to say that they are 100% transparent with their partner about every single thing in their life is most likely a false claim.  |-| 
|-| cogbm3h || 3 || **THANK YOU**. 
I hate that it has become culturally acceptable and even applauded to *shame* men in this manner. Male OR Female, you should not be trying to dictate and control how your partner masturbates. Period. 

That's their private time to love themselves. It is healthy and it is natural. Some people need some sort of *aid* when they masturbate, maybe a toy, a book or story, pictures, or video. 

OP has outlined perfectly what **real** addiction is. This is not it. You've also given phenomenal advice for anyone who is having this kind of issue in their relationship. Thank you for making such a wonderful post!

|-| cogcogs || 4 || That fucking fraud Dr. Phil has convinced my mother that porn is cheating. It almost ruined her and my step-father's marriage. I found her bawling one day because she checked the browsing history and found porn sites, it started a huge fight between them. I love my step-dad, he's the best one she ever found. I took a lot to  convince her that porn and masturbation are healthy and natural. She finally saw the light when I told her that what I told her is actually the stance that medical science takes on masturbation, and that Dr. Phil's methods and approach to psychology aren't supported by most of today's psychologists. |-| 
|-| cogbb1b || 3 || Honestly the issue is people not staying the fuck out of others relationships. Why the fuck does it matter to you if some women don't like porn and have an agreement with their SO not to watch it?

That's the problem here. Quit pretending your bullshit is what is right and everyone elses is wrong and it must be because these people are insecure/jelly/bullshit excuse you come up with.

If you get into a relationship with someone that is this hung up on porn then willingly go against their wishes YOU ARE AN ASSHOLE. FFS, people, you agree to these relationships.

I love how all this discussion goes to how dare these woman try to change or control the man. If you get into a relationship with someone that tells you they do not want you doing A, and you go and do A anyways because you think you should be able to because person B, C, D, and E on the internet said it's perfectly okay and natural, you went into a relationship trying to change that person. Period. Don't cry about how they are trying to change YOU after you have agreed to shit. You tried to change THEM. Ridiculous.

Stay out of people's relationships, people. Quit calling all men liars, too. My husband would not be very happy hearing he is a liar because he hates porn. He was molested as a child. There are many fucking reasons why one might not like it, and not all of them lead back to insecurities, but many do, sure. I would also be willing to bet most men are very insecure with their women watching porn. I've seen it more often than not. Men DO NOT generally like women fantasizing about other men. So the insecurity is there for everyone. Maybe the answer is to allow others to fucking live how they want to and quit nosing your way into their private lives? That would be nice.

Oh, and if you don't like something your SO tells you not to do, then get the fuck out. They don't owe it to you to change, and you don't owe it to them to change. So shut the fuck up, grow some fucking balls(both sexes here) and LEAVE if you don't fucking like it. |-| 
|-| cogatd1 || 4 || As a guy who's dated a woman who considered porn cheating, thank you. I did feel afraid and ashamed to open up to her.

She said sometimes she felt like I wanted to have sex too much, would get mad about me making moves. I stopped.

She got tired of me asking to have sex or fool around, so I stopped.

No one should feel like they're being forced into sex, but it's cruel to tell someone that jacking it is paramount to cheating, when a fair amount of men understand how much of an intimate emotional betrayal that can be.

I wish I woulda made a better case for porn (even homebrew), but I don't have great self-confidence. Looking back I'd do so much differently, but hindsights 20/20.

2. He is ashamed because he is afraid and not comfortable with his wife, maybe because you are restricting him far too much.

3. If he feels the need to hide porn from you, you are the problem, not him. It's not about attracting him, it's about him feeling comfortable with you. If you are doing something to irritate him, he will stop giving you his attention. |-|

Men  can actually use that energy from the orgasm and send it up our body instead of shooting it out in a tissue. It can seriously elevate our consciousness.

If she sees his "fuck that slutty bitch" porn collection is she expected to continue the relationship knowing his sexuality is tied with contempt for women? Any distinction for rape and torture porn?

|-| cog98su || -7 || The inferred binary that flows from such terminology as "sex positive" immediately casts any dissenting view in a pejorative light (which is, of course, what it is meant to do).  You've already denigrated the other's position.
  
Viewing pornography is unhealthy physically, mentally, and spiritually.  It is often misogynist and is always unrealistic.  It erodes the soul, enhances narcissism and furthers the objectification of women as sex objects; it is immoral.  Not a popular term these days but pornography is immoral.  There's no getting around that.

It's not cheating, but it's not right to look at another naked woman and feel turned on or feelings of lust. That should be reserved for me.  |-|

|-| cogaa65 || -3 || Honestly porn is no different than my imagination, it's just got cheaper production values and less extras.

In my experience people who have problems with porn and/or masturbation are people who cannot openly converse about sex. Their feelings tend to come out as a response to catching someone, or shock that they would even do these things in some form of a morality sermon more so than in a conversation where both sides feel open and not judged. It's an automatic put your partner on the defensive sort of thing in these cases.

For myself, I couldn't date someone that wasn't okay with porn and masturbation. Even the notion kind of makes me squint a little and furrow my eyebrows in a confused sort of look of how the hell it matters - but hey, to each their own. |-|

This is a little off topic, but I've known people who have ended up in the hospital for mental health issues, so here are some things that may be helpful a little later, for you and her family, once she is moved from the 72 hour hold to a hospital room. Laws vary slightly from state to state, but because of the stigma around mental health issues the hospital may not even be able to acknowledge to you that she is there unless she gives permission. She likely won't be allowed her cell phone, as she could take picture of other patients, which would be a breach of confidentiality. If anyone wants to visit or contact her in the hospital make sure that you or they are on the list of people she is allowed to see. Often times seeing people after a suicide attempt is really hard, so if you do see her don't be offended if she doesn't want to hang out long. She will very likely be allowed to have her own clothes, but no belts and likely no laces, either. Comfy clothes are best. Fuzzy socks are great. Hospital toiletries tend to suck, so small container of her own shampoo and conditioner will be really nice. Hospital food is sometime pretty good, and sometimes tastes like sewage, so she may want something, but before you bring anything check with the hospital first. As it comes wrapped in paper fast food is a good bet, but bring it in a paper bag, and avoid utensils, unless they allow them. They never allow glass or metal containers, but usually plastic containers are ok. Usually doesn't mean always, so check first. Depending on the meds they give her she may not be allowed caffeine, so if you get her soda make sure it's ok for her to have. There will be no real or even decent coffee anywhere on the floor she will be on, (it's all cheap decaf) and it's a locked ward. If she can have coffee then Trader Joe's sells some great instant packets of coffee with cream and sugar and they are cheap and pretty good. (Starbucks instant is pretty good too, but it's more and she'll need her own creamer.) She'll likely have access to hot water and cups, along with herbal tea and hot cocoa. The quality of this varies from hospital to hospital, so she may want her own supply of that, too. It's common for people to be required to remain in the hospital for 1-2 weeks for mental health issues, and with how serious and well planned her attempt was it will likely be closer to the 2 week mark for her, or even a day or two past that point (it's rare for people to stay past 17 days). She may want books, but all too often people that depressed don't have the focus to read, and they may remind her that her focus isn't what it should be. It's ok to just ask her what she wants or needs. 

If she gets really down about herself then consider giving her this article about [Marsha Linehan](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/health/23lives.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0), who created one of the most popular forms of therapy, and struggled with her own mental health issues. It's likely the type of therapy they will teach her while she is there. 

Sorry that turned into a novel, but I want you to know that you did a really good thing by helping her. You gave her a second chance. It's also ok for you to not know what to think or how to feel, or to even need to talk to a therapist yourself. |-| 
|-| cogssjh || 4 || Thank you for the follow-up. I am vicariously overjoyed and relieved. I lost a friend to suicide once and wish I could have done the same. 

In the wake of this, remember to support each other. Check in with others who were close to her to offer (and seek) support, both for things like remembering to eat and for the sake of talking about it and not letting comprehension of it swallow you whole, each of you alone. 

I'm so happy for you. Thank you.  |-| 
|-| cog4ava || 59 || *Stop shaming the trend shaming, shamer!* |-| 
|-| cog4azp || 20 || If it's any comfort, elitism transcends gender.

But yeah I agree. Obviously if someone is asking for tips on how to starve themselves in order to gain attention I'll panic and will tell them everything but, but if someone wants to lose weight then hell yes, who am I to tell you otherwise? We're all works in progress, we all have ways of living that make us happy. It reminds me of this article: http://theweek.com/articles/447722/mindy-kaling--lena-dunham--body-positive-icon-moment

Some of us are Mindy Kaling's that view themselves as works of progress, that like to be cute in every manner. Some of us are Dunhams who go "screw your standards" and don't feel any pride from looking cute in the same manner.

On a variation of shaming an OP with a reasonable request or idea, I do dislike it when say, Isamophobia rears its head. She wasn't asking how you felt about the hijab, brah. She was asking for awesome make up ideas or something, she doesn't care if you think showing her hair is the ultimate freedom. |-| 
|-| cogdt23 || 13 || Only if we can stop saying "ladybits" first.  |-| 
|-| coglmte || 13 || No one "shamed a specific type of labia" in that thread. People mentioned porn stars because that's probably what the OP had been exposed to as far as other women's genitalia. Objecting to people pointing out that labia can change shape and size during puberty, for instance (which the OP clearly stated happened to her) is "invalidating" other people's vulvae because it didn't happen to every single person? C'mon. People try to reassure her by saying that men often have no preference is "misandry" too? LOL OK. She's 16 and probably feeling insecure because she doesn't match up with the ideal. People can say, essentially, "what you have is normal and not ugly, don't feel inferior" without having to qualify with "OH BUT THE IDEAL IS TOTALLY NORMAL AND ATTRACTIVE TOO" cause that's not what it's about and, frankly, that's the prevailing societal message. 

Suggesting trimming instead of shaving is perfectly valid as well, since it has mostly the same effect while mitigating bumps and itchiness that often come with shaving (and that OP obviously didn't like having). I think people were answering like that because she's 16 and obviously insecure and they didn't know her motivation for shaving. If someone had straight up asked for shaving tips without providing any of the other information I'm sure people would have answered differently. Although I gotta say, I AM tired of dudes chiming in with "well this is MY preference" on threads like those.  |-| 
|-| cog2wjk || 23 || &gt; So can we take a second to create a rule or something that shaming of any type is not allowed

If you're talking about this sub, the things you mentioned are covered in rule 1: Respect. 

This is the standard, 'don't be an arsehole' rule, and we love it when people report arsehole comments. |-| 
|-| cog9txj || 12 || Very strange. I understand OP and I think OP comes from a place of respect...

But I remember the post in question, and I definitely think the 16 year old would be better off dealing with all of the medical issues (bump near anus) and self-esteem issues (feeling her labia didn't look pretty enough) than to stress herself out more with trying to shave a bikini line. I'm sure people gave good advice about how to achieve the effect she wanted, but I remember being 16 and in a similar situation as her...I would have been so happy if I had a place I went to where people said it was okay with looking the way I naturally did. You don't hear or see that too often these days. Oh well |-| 
|-| coglbji || 7 ||  &gt;It's much cleaner and easier to maintain in my opinion.

Actually, shaved female genitals harbour more harmful bacteria than unshaved.  http://www.alternet.org/doctor-pubic-hair-exists-reason-our-obsession-hairless-genitals-must-end-0

Pubic hair actually protects against harmful bacteria... it's one of it's purposes... http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/04/03/shaving-pubic-hair.aspx |-| 
|-| cog46yj || 15 || &gt; Now the popular trend is to provide alternate viewpoints or a "love yourself" perspective. I don't mind this at all

You do mind it, though.  Just the fact that people think and say these things threatens you. |-| 
|-| cog3ff6 || 37 || Shaming != Having an opposite opinion. 

Apparently no one is allowed to express a dissenting opinion about anything anymore ever because someone is going to be "shamed" or "triggered" or "fall apart into some mess".  |-| 
|-| cog87wx || 14 || I found the pubic hair question you're referring to and the girl who posted shaved her bikini line and did not enjoy the experience.  She specifically called it not fun.  You were the one who got all evangelical about it and gave her detailed instructions about how she should shave the whole thing because that's what you prefer. |-| 
|-| coga7xm || 7 || Also, I hate the "anti make-up" or anything seemingly "feminine" circle jerk. I don't believe these people care about what's natural or what's not, they just want someone to put down to make themselves feel better. Anytime these kinds of people tell girls "love yourself for who you are" then shame the things they love and want to do, it's not feminism, but controlling. Women are allowed to like what they like. That's another thing modern feminism seems to get wrong is it's not all about trying be like men or look like men in order to feel "empowered", but that this leads attacking women who do like seemingly feminine and girly things. 


 |-| 
|-| coga3jv || 14 || We need to stop pretending our choices exist in a vacuum. WHY do you believe shaving feels better and more hygienic? It sure doesn't feel that way because it inherently is. 60 years ago a shaved labia felt dirty to most women, it's what prostitutes did to cut down on crabs. It feels "cleaner" because that's what's been pushed at young girls now. It's not a choice you made by yourself, just like the backlash of unshaven women isn't a choice they mad independent of society either. |-| 
|-| cogmwll || 3 || The truth is everyone is affected by trends, in the end we stick with what we like and sometimes we get bored and change. People can act all high and mighty but we're all guilty.  |-| 
|-| cog715a || -3 || OP said: **Well first off I'd like to start with shaving** And asked about how to go about that, NEVER asking for alternative information, to which people replied:

&gt;Trimming just seems all around better than shaving for me.

&gt;Shaving sucks - at least, in my view. I hate it, and don't do it. 

&gt;You're going to run into a lot of guys who like shaved and have opinions on what ladybits should look like
Skip them.

&gt;My labia is also 'saggy' when I compare it to perfectly shaped porn stars who have had everything nipped and tucked.

&gt;Porn stars often get "Labiaplasty"- a kind of aesthetic plastic surgery to reshape their vagina. Comparing your vagina to theirs would be like comparing your breasts or made-up faces 
&gt;Also, labias do just kinda look like sacks of flabby skin. Let's be real - that's how they look. They are fine.

&gt;Vags are funny looking things. Whenever I look at mine I think wtf, why. But, every guy I've slept with loved it because they love snatch. Have no fear, men aren't looking for that perfect unicorn pussy.

&gt;When you hit puberty, your labia change shape and size

&gt;Man here. Don't worry about how it looks, men don't care. Seriously.

&gt;unless you are planning a career as a porn star, guys don't care.

&gt;I feel super creepy posting on this question cause im a guy, but i just wanted to say that some guys are into labia/vaginas like that. i personally am. fat cats with big dangling labia and huge clits are awesome imo. i want a vagina to look like a vagina, not just a lame hole

**OK WTF**

1. Why do so many people feel the need to talk about how much shaving sucks when OP never indicated she wanted to stop shaving?

2. OMG the misandry. Not all guys are the same. 

3. Some guys care. That doesn't make them any more of a pig than a woman who doesn't want to date someone with a face they find ugly. People have preferences and that is entirely their own business.

4. HOLY MISINFORMATION BATMAN! No, not all vulvas free of descending labia were sculpted by plastic surgeons. No, not all vulvas change after puberty. Way to invalidate the vulvas of literally millions of woman.

5. We're all accepting and loving of everyone, but no one cared, no one even down voted someone calling one type of a vagina a "lame hole". However, one comment about how women in 2x are sexist for thinking no men have preferences was down voted 7x.


Why couldn't there have just been advice about shaving? Why did everyone feel it was okay to shame a specific type of **naturally occurring** vulva? There is CERTAINLY a way of ensuring an OP is doing something for herself other than to shit on her choices and millions of women who have a "unicorn pussy". None of it was necessary, and it's just one reason why this sub can be obnoxious.








 |-| 
|-| cog6d0z || -12 || Finally a post I can agree with on this sub.  A lot of people in general, not just on here, get all up in arms when people have different opinions.  The skinny shaming is what bothers me the most.  That and the idea only women are subject to abuse.

Tangent:  Did anyone see the Grammys last night!?  That women abuse rally was absurd.  First thing I said to my GF after I asked her if she thought only women were abused was 'what about gay men who are in abusive relationships?'  Her reaction was 'huh haven't thought about that.' I'm tired of the men and abusive pigs and women are innocent angels.  It works both ways and the topic, if it is going to be publicly addressed, should reflect on both genders equally.  I can rant on this topic all day.  Don't even get me started on breast cancer vs prostate or even skin cancer!


What I was really just stopping by for was to say that I cannot bring myself to enjoy unshaven lady bits.  Shit, I even feel disgusting when I haven't kept my shit trimmed.
I also refuse to go down on a girl if I have to braid her hair first...and I don't blame a girl for thinking the same.  Who wants hair in their mouth...especially pubic hair.  For some reason, that part of your post stuck out to me and I had to comment.  I'm sure others disagree...huh...imagine that.

|-| cogf9zp || 3 || I got to talk to my husband today! He works out of state so he's gone for two weeks at a time, and we don't get a lot of time to chat while he's away. So I treasure all the chances I get to talk to him. He's a good egg. :) |-| 
|-| cogcuaw || 30 || I think that the idea the men are guided by dicks really do hurt both women and men. Not only are women supposed to be scared of every man and blamed for getting sexually abused, but men are always excused as some kind of sex animal that is only guided by their dick. There was a teacher in my school that had this idea the "men are visual, so women should cover up". No, we shouldn't cover up. I understand we might be physical attractive, but this still doesn't give anyone the right to touch anyone without their consent.  |-| 
|-| cog6ep3 || 28 || As a dude this guy nails it.  I take my kids to school and the mom uniform is yoga pants and a florescent top but the reality is they are there for the same purpose as I am, to pick up our kids.  There's nothing sexual about it it's just daily life.  Seeing and staring are vastly different things.  

I think the big mac analogy is really fantastic.  I might be in a restaurant and see someone else eating something or watch it go by.  I will ask the waiter about it but if I was staring at someone eating a steak I'd be a jerk.  

I think that the guys who do engage in douchebag behavior negatively affect everyone else.  From time to time I'll see a woman wearing something I think my wife would really like but I feel like I can't say anything due to the likely experiences she's had with idiots.  So instead of saying that dress looks great where did you get it I have to google blue dress with brown stripes and belt which doesn't tend to have the desired effect.   |-| 
|-| cog8k63 || 17 || This is ok. It panders to it's audience a bit, but it's not too far off the mark. I didn't much agree with the "lust is a choice" bit or the sentiment that people should be able to wear what they want with impunity from being stared at. Finding someone attractive isn't a choice it's a reaction, and the ability to control that doesn't change the fact. As far as being in public is concerned everyone has the right to dress however they'd like, but the people around have an equal right to gawk and cluck about it. I think ugg boots, swim trunks, and under armor are all comfy, but if I wear them together in public I'm going to get stared at, which is fine; I chose to wear the eye catching getup. Anything more than that is an entirely different conversation.  |-| 
|-| cogdwq6 || 5 || I'm a man and I don't care about modesty. |-| 
|-| cog83gr || 26 || As a guy I don't agree with this.  I know a lot of people like this argument, when it comes to modesty (or stuff about rape, harassment, etc), that the seeming pro-male side is actually infantilizing men, and the side that is pushing for more responsibility is actually pro-men because it treats them like they're more capable of being responsible.  But I think if you really examine this view, you'll see that it's wrong.

As a preface, I want to say, boys get all sorts of shame from a young age for liking girls.  That doesn't mean girls don't also get shit, but boys get shit, and they're told that liking girls is predatory and gross and you're corrupting them.  That's important background for what I'm going to say, and I also think it's a big reason for some of the reactions you see from guys defending anything they do sexually WRT girls.  Think about our society's general sex negativity - if you tell a group (in this case, men) that there's no right way to wanna have sex, then later it's harder to go back and tell them that certain specific ways to have sex are wrong.

First, take this:

&gt; Something that Hannah has mentioned before that I wholly support is the idea that lust is a choice, not a reaction.

Well I looked it up and lust means "very strong sexual desire" according to Google, and that *is* a reaction.  I can't make myself not think that Amber Heard is really hot (any more than Amber Heard can make herself not like girls).  And this is a sign of anti-male bias.  People tend to explain the actions of people they are more sympathetic to (usually including themselves) by reference to external forces pushing that person, and they explain the actions of people they're less sympathetic to by reference to their internal personality or disposition.  Saying that something is a choice when it isn't is usually a sign of negative feelings towards that group. 

Second, take this scenario: guy walks down the street, girl in tight fitting pants walks by, guy looks at her legs a little longer than he normally would before stopping and continuing to walk.  One response, the "big mac" response he mentions, is to blame the girl.  The response this guy has is, essentially, blame the guy and say he should take more responsibility.

My response:  why are we blaming anyone?  Nothing bad happened.  A man looking at a woman isn't inherently predatory.  If a girl dresses scantily in school, and a guy is attracted to her, *that's not bad*.  She doesn't need to dress "modestly", and he doesn't need to feel self-loathing about all the oppressing he's doing by liking how she looks.

More stuff:

&gt; This argument is used to justify too many things in today’s society. ... anything can be pacified with a good “boys will be boys” mentality. And as one of these “boys” myself, this logic has always seemed offensive.

I will just point out that contra people criticizing "boys will be boys", boys are *more* likely to receive harsh punishments in school for the same actions than girls.  Same with men in criminal cases.  Despite the phrase it's not an actual thing.  In fact, after Columbine, zero tolerance policies have hurt boys and fed mass incarceration.  The "let's get rid of 'boys will be boys'" is the same impulse leading to harsh punishments on boys.  Especially, by the way, black boys, not surprising given the negative stereotpyes of them.  This attitude feeds the school to prison pipeline.  

&gt; It implies that I am little more than an animal...

The thing is, you *do* have strong feelings for women.  Don't say "I don't have strong feelings because I'm not just an animal."  Say "I have those strong feelings, which is perfectly compatible with being human."

&gt; It implies that I am stupid. That I don’t know lusting after a woman is wrong, because I haven’t been taught not to. I never had the chance to attend “Human Decency 101”, so I get a hall pass.

**Lusting after a woman is not wrong.** If you've ever had sex with a man you were being lusted after, and (assuming it was consensual) liked the fact that he was lusting after you - do you think it was wrong?  To me this isn't implying I'm not stupid, it's implying I'm a knuckle-dragging neanderthal.  My liking Amber Heard doesn't mean I have no decency.

&gt; Society told me that I wasn’t responsible for these feelings. It told me that when a girl trespasses some invisible line in the modesty department it is suddenly okay to judge her. To view her as less than a person. To objectify.

Society told you that if you see a girl in a yoga outfit and think "nice ass", then you are viewing her as less than a person.  That is not true, and that is the problem, because you will never stop thinking girls have nice asses.  That idea is what leads guys to reflexively defend staring at a girl's ass in any situation, because they've always been told that just liking how the girl looks is itself wrong, and that's what they're hearing when you criticize them, and with good reason because society still tells you that.

&gt; Lust is shying away from her face so you can see her only as a body, an object.

Liking someone's body and looking at it, even at the expense of the face, isn't wrong.

&gt; Something that Hannah has mentioned before that I wholly support is the idea that lust is a choice, not a reaction.

&gt; I may be instantly attracted to a woman wearing a bikini walking past me at the beach. *I can’t stop the quick rush of those feelings, it’s biological.* But that isn’t lust, which seems to be where a lot of guys get tripped up.

The italicized part, the context in which it's written makes it sound like he thinks that that rush *is* something you should criticize if it *weren't* biological, which is fucked up.

One last example: [this](http://jezebel.com/homeschooled-girl-kicked-out-of-prom-because-of-leering-1575704609) story from Jezebel.  [This](http://www.hannahettinger.com/fuck-the-patriarchy-guest-post-by-clare/) is the original post of what happened.  Basically a girl got kicked out of prom after being told her dress was too short and giving the Dads impure thoughts.  If you read the original, it sounds like no Dad ever actually said this; one woman who seemed to randomly have a vendetta against her *claimed* it as a reason to kick her out, even though her dress wasn't more revealing than anyone else's (btw look at her and her date ... can't think of any *other* reason she'd be singled out by a random older person in a homeschooling prom in the South, from the moment she saw her and her date).

I saw people say about this story, what OP's article said: that the people OK with this are the real anti-male types, who think that men can't control themselves.  Expecting men to not lust after high schoolers is treating them like adults and not animals.  But to me the anti-male view, the one that sees men negatively, is Jezebel's: the one that in an unclear situation assumes the men are at fault.  A pro-male view is the one that doesn't just assume that if a woman said "your dress is making the men perv out" that the men *really were* perving out. |-| 
|-| coggos2 || 6 || Women can wear yoga pants. Men can look. It's not a big deal. That's how I feel about it. I really can't understand the perspective that married women shouldn't wear yoga pants and men shouldn't find them attractive.  That's advocating for a repressed society.  If a woman feels uncomfortable wearing them she can make a personal choice not to. How does that become national news (maybe even international). There was a woman on tv because she made the decision not to wear yoga pants anymore in public.

Edit to add: I did like and share this article.  |-| 
|-| cogcgto || 5 || as a man i can only tell you the guy who is writing this is either totally different than me and most other straight men, or a lying toad trying to pander to an audience.

yes i can not help but look sometimes. there is nothing more distracting in the world to me than a beautiful woman. this is not something i can change or that i have decided. 

now does that mean that women should dress modestly? no, they should dress however they want to but there is no point in pretending that men won't look at beautiful women.

does that mean that men should have the right to stare and make women feel uncomfortable? no of course not. there is a middle ground imo. |-| 
|-| cog58ax || -7 || I really want to believe this narrative but:

'“If you wear yoga pants, how can you expect me not to stare?”

Well, no, I don't usually stare like a maniac either but I look. This is not something I can turn off. It will almost definitely grab my attention. He swipes at this with the 'hamburger-woman' analogy but i'm pointing it out anyway.

"Society told me that I wasn't responsible for these feelings. It told me that when a girl trespasses some invisible line in the modesty department it is suddenly okay to judge her."

Yeah I was never taught this - he is confusing being a man with being a bully. Either way, more upbringing issues. Women have their own version of this nonsense.

"lust is a choice, not a reaction."

Yes, yes it is, but these are not 'order of' or 'sequential' for men (assuming the end result is a relationship). 

Etc, etc. |-| 
|-| cogjg3r || -5 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| cogjm1w || 29 || You can press charges for him trying to hit you did you? I'd ge a restraining order too.
Good thing sticking u for someone
 I really wish she had pressed charges and left and this guy laves you guys alone.

Please be careful people who will abuse someone outside can be scary and unpredictable |-| 
|-| cogi7kz || 49 || No, you showed your kid that no matter how bad the situation you stand up for other people. Things could have gone much worse, but you chose to step in and do the right thing anyway, which is more than most people can say.


We all like to make excuses about "not having enough time" or "what if it gets out of hand" - you didn't make excuses, you did what needed to be done. Fuck, if half of us would stand up for each other like you and your husband did, then maybe the world wouldn't be such a shitty place. |-| 
|-| cogixuu || 19 || Remaining calm is almost always going to win the day.  You did fine by letting him know you saw him and were calling the police.  But running down the sidewalk and not communicating to your family before hand is the result of blind emotion.  Blind emotion in an emergency situation is usually not a good thing.  Its fine to be angry and proactive.  Its not okay to rush in full of adrenaline without thinking.  When you rush into an emergency without a calm thought you open the door for bad things to happen.

TL:DR- you did the right thing, just not necessarily the right way.  Be proactive *and* safe in the future. |-| 
|-| cogkfvd || 6 || Hindsight is always 20/20. It would be easy for me to dispense sage advice, editing at my leisure from the comfort of my couch. You acted in the heat of the moment. Who knows? One more minute, one more punch and that woman may not have lived. I'm sure if SHE has a son, he's extremely grateful you acted as you did. As for your son, if the worst example you show him is how fearless you are and how quickly you'll jump in to save a stranger, way to go!  |-| 
|-| cogr602 || 5 || Girl, you are a fucking hero. I think your son will look back on that as an incredibly positive and powerful example of doing what is *right*. Was it necessarily the safest or most rational reaction? Nah, but you know what else isn't? Beating your loved one up on the side of the street. No one expects to see that much less plans on how to react that, unless you are a police officer. 

Also, is seems like that man should be charged with at least two different crimes (in my jurisdiction at least): Assault Family Violence of the woman, and Assault/Battery of *you*. If you are at all interested in seeing that justice is done more than it already has, call the non-emergency number to ask for an update from the officers and then ask if it's been referred to the county attorney or DA's office yet. If it has, call either office and volunteer to come in and give a witness statement. 

I help prosecute these cases all the time and they are tough to move forward on with uncooperative victims (regular occurrence in these cases), but it's not impossible *especially* with witnesses like you! Plus that man came at you!! Ugh...what a piece of shit. What you did was inspiring, and your son is damn lucky to have someone as courageous as you as his mother. Also props to your boyfriend for making sure your son was safe!! :) Great team you two make! |-| 
|-| cognfvk || 4 || You reacted to what you saw. While I applaud you for defending another human being the best advice i can give anyone in a confrontational situation is to make sure you and yours are taken care of first.


Think of it like the instructions given to you by the airlines concerning the oxygen masks. Put yours on before you put it on anyone else. 

Calling the Police=good
Comforting and defending the woman = good
no letting your partner know what you were doing = bad 
(the last part is not a msyigonist statement of let the man handle it. It is letting your SO know so they can take appropriate action to support you) |-| 
|-| cogjz0m || 6 || Lady, I don't see what you did wrong there. In fact, I have no idea why you feel stupid at all. Besides, your kid's gotta know the truth about these sorts of things, and that even if the motherfucker doing this is the size of a bouncer, you've gotta stand up for whats right. |-| 
|-| cogn0ij || 3 || I'm glad he didn't come out with a weapon of some sort... |-| 
|-| cogokgf || 3 || You were brave. You might not have handled it appropriately, but you were brave.

Does this guy know where you live if he saw where you pulled in? Might be worth looking in to pressing charges and getting a restraining order. |-| 
|-| coglc87 || 3 || Please tell me you had him charged with assault on you too!

I had a similar situation happen - we were in the minivan with two kids in the back.  I pulled over and asked her if she wanted me to call the police.  She said yes (he then ran away).  We stayed in the car until she was safe.  We can't just be bystanders.
 |-| 
|-| coghjq7 || 4 || You did the right thing. Your son, I will try to talk things over with him and explain that it's a bad aituation.


Hope she is okay. |-| 
|-| cogz0cv || 14 || He wanted the baby, but you're the one staying home raising it? Fuck that noise. Tell him he's going to have to either watch after the baby half of the time, or hire someone else to do so. Go back to school, get a job, get your own life. There's no reason you should be the primary guardian of a child you didn't want. |-| 
|-| cogukni || 28 || Agreed on the possibility of PPD -- a doctor's opinion wouldn't hurt -- but I think therapy, if you get it, should involve you both. It sounds like you need help sorting through major issues between you. The whole "okay, I want this kid, but you get to stay home and mind it while I work" sits badly with me. You didn't ask for that. You deserve to go forward. If he wanted a child that badly, he should have taken *you* into account.  |-| 
|-| cogujtc || 42 || &gt;I used to be so happy, and now I'm just this angry, angry shell of a person. I feel like my soul is dying a little more every day. I'm constantly upset and tired and just so, SO angry.

Woah, time out because this is a lot, and it could be more than a baby before you were ready. Talk to your doctor and your boyfriend about how you're feeling. See a therapist and likely try some medication for the short term. This could be Post Partum Depression and you don't want to make any major decisions right now. You won't ever have the exact same body you did a year ago, but it won't always look like this. You're still healing. There's so much changing, and it doesn't have to be this way even if you stay. You don't have to be a stay at home mom. You don't have to live in isolation. There are ways to parent that are not what you're doing right now, and they're just as valid and ok.

If you do those things and they don't help and you don't have PPD, you aren't a terrible person for abandoning your child. You're a terrible person if you do that and don't pay child support, but you have to take care of yourself. I do think it would be wrong of you to leave and have no involvement in your child's life, but you don't have to be the custodial parent or primary caretaker, especially when your boyfriend sounds like he'd be happy to take that on since he was the one who most wanted the baby. You may have made a mistake and if you did, you have to live with the consequences, but at the same time, you and your boyfriend can figure out terms that work for you and your baby. |-| 
|-| cogulio || 16 || I'm so sorry you're going through this. It could be post-partum depression, but it also sounds like you really didn't want a child, and that's completely valid and legitimate. I don't want kids, either, and I'd imagine I would be pretty upset if I suddenly had one. I think some people don't realize that some people just do not want kids. And that's okay! So what if you want to focus on your career/life/education? It should be all up to you. Is adoption still an option for you at all?   |-| 
|-| coguhdr || 4 || Make an appointment and follow up with your doctor.  You need a referral to therapy for some coping strategies. |-| 
|-| cogy42x || 5 || Don't think that only people suffering from clinical depression seek therapy.  Frequently, people who are stuck in shitty situations, with no one to talk to, are able to benefit from counseling.  A good therapist will give you advice on how to cope with your feelings, as well as help you to figure out those things that you can change without upturning the whole apple cart.

Like, maybe your boyfriend (with help from the inlaws) can spring for a babysitter a couple of days of week so that you can get some much needed "you" time. If they call you out for being selfish for making this request, you can remind them that you told them upfront you weren't ready for this shit and that you're going nuts. 

 |-| 
|-| cogultu || 23 || If you can't be a good mother, do your baby a favor and leave your relationship. Let the dad raise the child. Sign off on your parental rights, go on with your life and don't look back. Like you said, it's not fair for the kid or you, so do the right thing. Leave. |-| 
|-| coguazz || 13 || Classic case of post-partum depression, time for a therapist. The time for should've, would've, could've is over. Unless adoption is still an option, you need to take responsibility for your child. But seriously, I'm no doctor, but this seems like a textbook case of post-partum depression.  |-| 
|-| cogur5m || 6 || I just want to say: I'm so sorry for you, OP. So sorry that nobody was listening to you. I hope you'll find the strength now to reach out and find some *real* help, people who *are* listening to you. I hope that you'll find a way to deal with this situation. You have options and choices. Big hugs from across the oceans...  |-| 
|-| coguxhq || 3 || I agree with the advice to see your doctor and get a referral for therapy. In the meantime, you mention wanting to go to school and work. Would it be possible to do either of these things part time? Perhaps take some weekend, evening or online courses? Also, perhaps a part time job? I'm sure it's not what you envisioned, but it might be a compromise that would help you feel a bit more connected to your goals and the outside world you're missing. Also, getting out for a few hours might make you appreciate being home with the baby a bit more. 

As for your boobs, yes, gravity's a bitch. Treat yourself to a good quality, well-fitting push up bra. Again, not a magic solution, but being able to appreciate your reflection in the mirror might cheer you up a bit. 

You are not stupid and you don't have to sacrifice your entire life. Since you both have families, I hope there's someone nearby you can confide in (preferably someone who'll offer support and to babysit once in a while so you can take a break) Good luck.  |-|

|-| cog52t2 || 31 || You do you! Just remember you get what you pay for. |-| 
|-| cog5jsj || 10 || Mine are almost exactly the same size (probably smaller). Push-up bras don't even work on me. I'm 21 and I have never had cleavage, no matter what I do. My breast bone is also slightly deformed where the middle of my chest sticks out more than my breasts. It's not that bad, but makes most bras uncomfortable. 

If you have the means to get yours augmented, do it. I would kill to get mine done and feel comfortable wearing a bra for once.  |-| 
|-| cog3jh1 || 13 || IMO, if you think this will make you happier, do it. I went through a second puberty a couple of years ago and finally grew boobs and hips and am MUCH happier with the way that I look. |-| 
|-| cog4ftx || 9 || I think you look fine as is, but what I think doesn't really matter and I don't think you would look strange with larger breasts, either. I think that if you would like to have larger breasts and you're realistic about the relatively low level of impact it would have on your life aside from your self image, which it sounds like you do, then you should go for it. I mostly only worry about women who think that they need larger breasts to be attractive or that plastic surgery will change their lives, but it sounds like you just want them because you would rather have them and that's a pretty healthy reason to have a breast augmentation. Just make sure you find a reputable, experienced surgeon of course, because a bad augmentation is really awful looking. |-| 
|-| cog484d || 7 || To me, it appears that you really have thought about it, and it doesn't seem to be coming from a place of low self-esteem. If you understand the costs, the risks, and the maintenance then go for it. Getting big boobs for men is just as stupid as keeping small boobs for men. I agree that can be annoying as hell when people are like "but I like your perceived flaw" because I don't base the love for myself on how much people love me and I really shouldn't. 

You said you have thought about it for three years, I think that says a lot that this isn't some hasty decision, and you are unlikely to suddenly be happy with the things that annoy you, especially since your reasons are totally legit. I have small breasts as well and sometimes I put on the padded bras and I can feel the padding and I think about how nice it would be if I could have boobs like this without the bra. Or a wear a low cut top and I can tell that this would be like a bajillion times sexier if I had the boobs to fill it out, and it's lame because I am trying my hardest to look sexy and I just end up at pretty. 

I think one thing that is sort of missing is the benefits of small boobs, which makes sense here, but should factor into your decision. I can wear low cut stuff and not look indecent, I do think I look younger, androgynous fashion looks nice on me... but this is all my opinion and maybe these things don't matter to you because you hate low cuts and dislike androgyny. 

I don't think you need a list of golden amazing reasons about how your life would be 200 percent better if you had bigger boobs. I think a lot of people would have plastic surgery if it was more affordable, and they would do it for much simpler reasons than the ones you listed here. So go to a consultation, doctor shop, make sure you have your facts straight. Maybe if you get more information, you will want it, but maybe not too. However I don't think you are being rash or have low self-esteem. Boob jobs have this connotation of desperation and shallowness but I am guessing a lot of women get boob jobs for the same reasons you listed here. 
 |-| 
|-| cog5r1k || 4 || I think you have an awesome figure, but this choice isn't about how anyone feel other than you. It sounds like you've thought this through and aren't making a snap decision. And I agree an augmentation would make a noticeable change to your silhouette and body shape. Do what makes you happy!  |-|

|-| cog5l48 || 3 || There's nothing wrong with breast augmentation, but I suggest going over to /r/abrathatfits if you haven't already. 

There are a couple of bra bloggers I know of who have had augmentations. There's [Science and Silicone](http://scienceandsilicone.blogspot.ca/2015/01/a-breast-augmentation-journey-part-i.html) and [By Baby's Rules](http://bybabysrules.com/2014/03/27/about-me/). |-| 
|-| cog4ny6 || 3 || As a dude, I say you should do what makes you happy. You have a really nice frame (much harder to augment than boobs, btw. nice luck on that part!) and to be honest your chest doesn't really seem to match your frame. I'm hoping the somewhat-harsh honesty helps ensure that you know that I'm being forthright with you.

My recommendation from an emotional standpoint would be to see if you can somehow "test drive" the bigger boobs so you can see how the weight and appearance makes you feel over the course of a week or two.

Not sure if there's a solution out there that won't look like bra-stuffing, but surgery is something that should be approached with caution.

Best of luck! :-) |-| 
|-| cog9peq || -3 || I used to feel this way. I have the same body type - broad shouldered, large frame, used to get mistaken for a dude sometimes, hated my boobs so much I decided I never wanted to have kids so I wouldn't pass down my disgusting body to another generation. Hooray for youthful insecurity!

Then I hit my mid 20s and it all changed. I got a lot more confident, but that's not all. My older friends with big boobs are dealing with the whole "tennis ball in a tube sock" look and my boobs look BETTER than they ever did - a little bit of sag has made them look plump and pleasing to my eye. 

Also my mum is 60 and also has lil boobs and they look good - even after breastfeeding back in the day, they don't have that deflated look many larger boobs get. I'm so glad I never traded in my IBTC membership card when I was young and insecure, because now I love the lil fun bags!

Might I suggest spending some time at a nude spa and looking at many real women's imperfect bodies - that's helped me with my body image. Because no one there looks perfect, everyone has some amazing flawless features and then some fucked up shit that a magazine would airbrush... There were weird flaws I never even knew existed, because I never realized I was comparing myself to a nonexistent ideal. Love the nude spa.

Oh yeah the other rad thing about having tiny boobs is you can dress as slutty as you want and no one will ever call you slutty. They just say you look like a glamorous model, even if you're wearing basically lingerie. It's the best! |-|

|-| cogetx0 || 3 || What a great article. I live in Mexico City and it appears that it is a norm for women to deal with this crap everyday. And the problem is that this kind of attitudes are not spoken out because it's just so "normal" in everyday life. It gets even worse outside of the capital where it is almost an attitude that can come from any social class (due to the greater influence of machismo culture).

This is dangerous, and that way of thinking is very linked to the shocking numbers of feminicide rates in places such as the Estado de Mexico and Ciudad Juarez. |-| 
|-| coguhox || 5 || Darling. (I call everyone darling.) You have done your homework. You have done everything short of surgery. Since that didn't work, you've made a choice to make yourself happy. Hold that in your heart. 

If you think you'll feel pukey due to pain meds or anesthesia, it may not hurt to ask for an anti-puke drug to be added to the post-surgical IV. Do what your doc says during the recovery period and you should be fine. &lt;3 |-| 
|-| coguazj || 3 || Here's hoping you have a speedy recovery! Good luck, and congrats on making the right choice for you.  |-| 
|-| cogwfeb || 3 || Hey I was with a friend when she got implants done and she was pretty uncomfortable the first night. If you can make sure you have some one there for you with heat/ cold packs, painkillers, juice and something to watch that doesn't require too much brainpower.

Doctors seem to be pretty good on after care so don't be scared to call them anytime for questions. And straight after surgery they'll probably look swollen. They will settle down into everyone's favourite lovably squishable texture. Also the stitching looks pretty scary and black at first but seems to fade pretty quickly to the point where unless you know you wouldn't notice (friend used bio oil once stitches are out - don't know if that's a recommended thing or not).

Her experience seemed very positive and she looks great, hope everything goes well for you tomorrow. Just relax, don't stress and let people pamper you a little! |-|

Yes, that's controlling abusive behavior.

&gt; Then i couldn't talk to any guys at all, even to ask a simple question (ordering from a guy would get me in trouble sometimes). 

That's extremely controlling behavior. And is extremely abusive.

&gt;And then not even my dad.

Holy shit.

&gt;Since day one i was no longer allowed to watch porn or masterbate.

Why does he get to set the rules? Do you get to set rules for him?

&gt;We now fight OFTEN... really often.. As in pretty much daily... He cusses at me and says threatens to leave.

This is a typical form of controlling behavior, he's abusing you emotionally using your relationship as a pawn in his game.

&gt;He makes it seem like everything's my fault (but, as i said, its a daily thing so i'm used to it and i know he doesn't mean it).

That's called [Gaslighting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting). It's a rather typical form of emotional abuse.

&gt;When he gets really riled up he says he'd beat me, and a few times its even came to kill but he never does that in person, its only ever on the phone.

People in good relationships do not threaten each other.

&gt;I 100% know that he doesn't mean anything he says when he's mad, he's an extremely caring and gentle man. He's very protective and only wants me to be safe.

Absolutely none of that is true. He doesn't care about you at all. It's an act. He pretends to care about you to make you feel close to him. If he gave a shit about you, he would trust you around other people, he wouldn't try and control you, and he wouldn't threaten you. Kind and gentle people do not act that way. He's not being protective, that's a lie, he's being controlling because he has a violent self esteem problem.

&gt; I do love him but i don't want to end up like the women who every one pity for being in an abusive relationship...

You're already there.

&gt;I just want the man i fell in love with back...

I'm really sorry, but he didn't exist, that was an act. He might act that way in desperation if you try to leave. But it's not him, and the real him will always come back.

Seriously, you need to get away from this person before he hurts you. Everything you said is what people in much more violent relationships say. There are people who are beaten and stabbed who insist that their abuser loves them, doesn't mean it, and that it's actually their own (the victim's) fault. Don't be like those people.

This person is dangerous, don't just talk to him, don't tell him you're breaking up, just leave. Find a shelter or someone safe to stay with, he's made it hard for you but there are places you can go. 

Good luck, and I'm so sorry. |-| 
|-| cogpwfb || 13 || This reminds me of my life as a naive 18-year-old.  I was in a relationship with a man who did pretty much all of the things you just described.  Take it from someone who has been in that situation that the relationship you're in is absolutely abusive.  Abuse does not necessarily mean physically assaulting you.  He is manipulating you into doing things you would never normally do (ie stop talking to all men).

I thought I was doomed to live in fear that I would accidentally do something to make my ex angry, but I finally got the courage to leave and life has been so much better since.  I met and married a man who has never gotten jealous over something petty, never tried to manipulate or guilt trip me to get his way, and never even raised his voice at me.  People like my husband do exist and you deserve a man who treats you as well as my husband treats me.  Yes, breaking up fucking sucks like no other, but trust me when I say you're wasting your time with this poor excuse for a man. |-| 
|-| cogoihr || 18 || Yes, that's absolutely abusive. 

The man you fell in love with was an illusion crafted to get you attached to him. Once he had the hook set, he started letting you see the real him. You can't get back the man you fell in love with, because the man you fell in love with does not exist. You can't fix him. You can't magically make him be not abusive. He can change when and if he decides his behavior is a problem, genuinely desires to change, and spends a significant amount of time and effort making an effort to change with the help of a professional. Don't hold your breath, don't stick around, don't believe promises to change. (Every abuser promises to change, they'll promise you the moon if it gets you to stay.)

Please read [LoveIsRespect.org](http://www.loveisrespect.org/), they have tons of resources including chat and phone hotlines. |-| 
|-| cogpfbe || 9 || OP, get the hell out of dodge. After 30 days of NO COMMUNICATION (not even texting or group settings), see how you think about the situation. He is actually dangerous. 

I hate to say it, but your rhetoric is classic justification by an abuse victim. Please, for the love, leave.  |-| 
|-| cogslks || 8 || OP I strongly suggest against this 30 day grace period. No abuser will change their ways in a month. All he's gonna do is play up the sweet guy act and pretend the nice him is back and it will only make it a lot harder for you in the end. Please make a clean break  |-| 
|-| cogpk8s || 7 || &gt;I 100% know that he doesn't mean anything he says when he's mad, he's an extremely caring and gentle man. He's very protective and only wants me to be safe.

Real Talk:  You have problems with codependency.  What you said there is absolutely textbook.  You can work through this with a qualified therapist or counselor.  At the very least do some reading about codependency, denial and abusive relationships. |-| 
|-| cogolt2 || 6 || Yes. A healthy relationship does not isolate you from your friends and family. A healthy relationship is based on trust -- wherein he would trust you to talk to other guys. Threatening you is an escalation of that; the fact that you're questioning yourself about this should be enough. I'm sure you do love him, but love is respect and the man you fell in love with is not the man who your SO really is. |-| 
|-| cogp4gv || 7 || yes yes yes yes


Controlling your life and not letting you talk to half the population has nothing to do with being loving and protective!! It's controlling and possessive and ISOLATING. Tactic number one of abusers is isolation! he's even threatening you which is so far beyond the pale it is undeniable. Don't ever be comfortable that a controlling threatening lunatic is too loving to actually hurt you. PLEASE get out |-| 
|-| cogq4ch || 5 || What everyone on this board is saying is absolutely true. 

Your first red flag should have been his dictating control over who you could be friends with. 

I really hope you heed the advice here, no one deserves to be treated like this in a relationship, you are obviously unhappy, trust your instincts and tell yourself that you deserve better and move on. |-| 
|-| cogupx6 || 3 || Oh, dear. I hear my mother in you and my DNA contributor in the guy. Seventeen years of marriage, two suicide attempts, a cracked jaw, quarterly bruises and a devastated sense of self that hasn't healed in twenty years. Sometimes I see the potential my mother might have been without him tearing her down for seventeen years, then the four years of stalking (that he justified as ensuring his "child support" was being used as he approved but was really an excuse for more emotional terrorism) but that much damage doesn't heal clean. 

I am the reason she stayed, because she got pregnant and decided to marry him. He didn't hit until I was two or three, but one of my earliest memories is of them fighting, and of him swearing at her. 

I remember the first time I realized he was full of shit, and what he said was absolutely not true. It's shattering to be three and realize that level of malice in someone who is supposed to keep you safe.  

It's taken me decades of therapy to learn to trust and to root out the mental parasites that witnessing abuse (and eventually receiving it) planted in my psyche. I was ten when I snapped one night during one of their fights and screamed for him to just stop. He choked me and told me if I ever protested again, he would cut out my tongue. Sure, he apologized twenty minutes later, but he was honeymooning me, now, too. I spent the next several years always knowing where the really lethal weapons were, and learned to use a drill and wiring specifically to route a secret phone line and phone into my bedroom closet. I had to use it more times than I wanted to -- cops, crisis lines, Samaritans. I was a kid. I couldn't go, but to indicate how bad it got... I fantasized about orphanages and group homes and foster care as improvements. I did run away, legally -- I managed to wrangle a scholarship to boarding school for my last two years of high school. That was the best year of my life until then, but he forced me back via the final custody arrangement. He insisted on having his visits, and so took away the best thing I had. As he had done to my mother. 

He humiliated me and my mother in front of our friends because it made him feel powerful and in control. The first time a friend of mine saw it -- the first time my friend ever met him -- my friend tried to convince his parents to foster me. In two minutes, my fellow HS freshman knew I was in deep, dark water. 

My mother never went anywhere alone from the time I was an infant because he was sure she was having torrid monkey sex with strangers on a bread and milk grocery run. She couldn't take a troop of Girl Scouts camping without his supervision, thus ruining for me one of the few places I felt safe and one of the few places where she found true, nonjudgmental support and allies. He lied to get my mother expelled from a professional course that she needed to get the better job that would make leaving a little easier, but without which she was condemned to low wage admin work. Then he berated her for being too stupid... And she eventually believed him. When you hear something often enough, it becomes easier to accept it than to fight it, especially when you don't have much energy to spare in fighting yourself, too. 

As the child I hope you don't have and hope you never have with this guy, as a life-long witness to it... I ask you exactly what I begged my mother when I was six. Please, please leave. Please pack up your car and kitty, pick a direction and drive through three tanks of gas. Please change your phone number (and tonight, block him and every one of his friends who might lend him a phone.) Please move as soon as you possibly can. Please find a new job and city, preferably a new state hundreds of miles away. Please start now, not in thirty or ten or three or one day. If you have an emergency fund, this is what it's for. Please get out and never look back. Please be paranoid now, because leaving is what will trigger his worst character. Please be aware that words are as cutting as knives and as blunt and brutal as fists. Please realize that it will escalate and it will not get better because he has a habit he knows reliably works on you. That habit will always be his first instinct with you, and even assuming he commits to therapy (unlikely; abusers tend to try to manipulate the therapist, too), under stress, that first habit will call like heroin. 

Please don't fear being alone. I'm pretty sure that many people in your life will be delighted to help and thrilled to have you back.   Please don't fear the pain of walking away. It's a paper cut compared to the daily sanding your brain is taking now. Yes, change feels terrible -- a devil you don't know -- but the one you do know is hurting you. 

Abuse doesn't have to leave bruises, but it always tries to leave scars. The ones that other people can't see are the ones that hurt longest and worst. 

You will manage, but the sooner you start, the faster and easier it will go. It took my mother eight years to get him down to one harassing call a month and a drive by every few weeks. You really don't want that long tail.

There is no orgasm and no amount of financial support that ever justifies letting someone destroy yourself.  |-| 
|-| cogvm5d || 3 || Please don't give him 30 days, just leave. I have a pretty sure feeling that he will "change" for 30 days and then go back to being his awful self. Make it easier for yourself, rip it off like a bandaid and just get rid of this guy. He is not gentle or caring, gentle and caring people don't threaten to kill you or kick your sick cat. You can and WILL find better, but you can't do that if you don't leave. |-| 
|-| cogr8yh || 3 || More then likely when you have to ask the question "is this abusive". Chances are it is.   |-| 
|-| cog0v1i || 12 || It's a delicate balance.  You can't refuse to serve a customer, since that's your job, but you don't have to make it a fight back and you don't have to 'engage' with customers.  You can handle a lot of it effectively yourself.

&gt; I have been asked out on lots of dates, been given numbers and emails addresses

These aren't harassment- ASKING people out is accepted in our society.  There's no law that says people can't ask you out on dates, and no law about how old the person has to be to ask you.  Just brush them off and keep working.  You can deal with these yourself, by not accepting the piece of paper with phone number.  If they are standing there holding out a piece of paper at you with their phone number, just ignore them and keep the conversation on topic.  Ask professionally with a smile, 'do you want fries with that?'  Ask again.  Keep the topic about their order.  Never respond to date requests or any other remark you don't like, with any answer but 'Do you want fries with that?."

Ignore the guy who asks you to spin 360 degrees, pretend you don't hear those.  Make sure you don't engage in conversation that is not related to their order.  Shut down your ears to anything that isn't related to their order.  Don't hear it, don't respond to it. 

But you don't have to put up with the guy who kisses your arm.  You would have been justified legally in punching him, I think, so I hope you at least pulled your arm away and shouted at him.

There is little that your manager and supervisors can do to oversee your personal interactions with customers.  They aren't social police.  They aren't going to tell X people they can't ask you out on a date.  That's not enforceable.  They can't tell customers/any other people, that they 'aren't allowed to ask out our employees'.  

They are also not police.  They can't physically intervene with anyone, and won't turn away customers unless they start breaking the law or sexually harassing you, and then they can only call the police.  And face it, asking you out or giving you their phone number, is not sexual harassment, unless its the same guy all the time who is not taking no for an answer and is starting to follow you home.  Asking people out is normal behavior in our society and accepted.  So you can't expect your bosses to police things that are normal in society and that you just don't want.  Asking you out, doesn't constitute the crime of sexual harassment so its not anything they can intervene on, or call police for.  You're going to have to learn to handle these situations in the adult employment world and learn to ignore and not respond to anything that isn't related to customer orders.

BUT, following you to your car, IS harassment.  Start carrying pepper spray.  Ask your manager what his plan is, for when you are followed to your car.  He IS responsible for your safety at work.  But so are you.  Call 911.  Your manager is not a police officer, so don't expect him to come out and tackle the guy to keep him away from you, he is a citizen who has to call police to come do that.  And you should be reporting when you are followed to your car to the only people who CAN deal with someone following you; the cops.

Asking you out is not a threat to your safety.  Following you to your car after work, is. 
   |-| 
|-| coge5sw || 3 || Your manager should be backing you up but one way or the other try

"No thank you but if you want something on the menu I can get it for you!"

Be polite, firm and say "no thank you"  rinse and repeat.

"No thank you.  When you decide what food you want tell me"

Also if you work for a large company try calling  their main office.
No one at Mc Donalds for instance wants it in the news that their managers will let the employees be mauled.  Did you have a chance to rebut what that guy said to HR?  I'd write a letter. 

You can tell them what the guy said and did not feel safe or that your current managers would back you up.

Also keep looking for another job. 

Good luck!

|-| coglpog || 4 || &gt; Between 2009 and 2011, Ethan Czahor, co-founder of Hipster.com and now chief technology officer of Right to Rise PAC, made a series of inflammatory comments about "sluts" and gay men at the gym, among others.

|-| cognz5p || 6 || I forget the term for it, but there is a term to describe the limited appetite for the public towards public service announcements. I can't track down what it was, but it was somethings like PSA fatigue or something like that.

Basically, after a certain point, when groups keep pumping out announcement after bulletin after advertisement, the populace just tunes it out and honestly, this topic as been pushed so hard over the last year or two that I'm tuning it out too.

I mean honestly now, this topic has been covered so frequently and so vigorously, I can't imagine that anyone who reads newspapers or watches the news won't have heard it, or a similar one about five times already, so what purpose does this awareness campaign serve? Considering how often these campaigns roll around, I'd say the public is pretty damn aware, but they don't stop running them so they obviously don't think they're working and if they're not working why do they keep trying the same thing and expecting different results? |-|

|-| cogize0 || 10 || I think he installed a keylogger on your computer and that's why your accounts are still getting hacked. 

1. Go to a computer that is NOT YOURS, THAT HE HAS NO ACCESS TO, sign into all your online accounts and change the passwords. Make it something tough, like a mnemonic. The first letters of "My Ex Boyfriend Is A Crazy Fucking Asshole" can easily turn into Meb1@CfA and be very difficult to guess. (Use your own sentence, obviously.)
 
Then you need to have your computer and phone scanned for keyloggers. [Here](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4243511?tstart=0) is a discussion on how to scan, or if you would rather, take it to a pro.

Don't log into your own Mac until you get it cleaned. Otherwise he'll just have the passwords and stuff as usual.
 
 |-| 
|-| cogjll6 || 6 || Hey, a similar thing happened to a colleague of mine. 
We work with actors a lot, so got into a relationship with someone in the industry and he was convinced that she would leave him for X actor or Y actor, but nothing was ever ever ever going on. Slowly she started to notice Facebook sign-ins from places she definitely wasn't there that day (his University for example, a cafe in Shoreditch when she was on a shoot in Pimlico), changed her password (and all security hits/questions) and it would be fine for a little while... 
... Then it would start all over again, same process - all the while, he was denying any knowledge of it....

Finally, they broke up as she couldn't deal with the paranoia from him... Then suddenly Facebook goes again...! So she turned on two step verification (synced only to her phone) so he wouldn't be able to access the key code generated, unless he had your phone or was sitting close enough to read.

As for the email, who is your server with do you know? Is it something like gmail or more complex like Brinkster or GoDaddy for example? You can essentially put a block (two step verified sign in like Facebook above too) on any unknown servers/IP addresses (I.e. Register your "home network", your "work network" as recognised and then for anything other browsers/logins, you will get a text to your phone with a code to state you're attempting to sign in on a new browser, if it's you - amazing, put in the code... If it's not, well now you have proof that someone is attempting to access your email, so you can start to build a clear record of this happening. 
Depending on who your email provider/server are, it's worth contacting them too stating someone is regularly attempting to hack into and use your account for intimidation purposes. They can also track this - the more evidence you have, the better.

As for passwords, change each one - a random phrase, numbers and characters. My personal password trick is to ask the question (if you get that option) in another language and answer it in a different one. For example, I speak German and one of my password questions is about something that happened to me as a child ;plus some random numbers and characters) however apparently seeing a password question or prompt can deter the want to be hacker somewhat. Definitely change iCloud and get server notification/recognition too.

Above all though, stay safe! Make sure you've told people that this is happening - gather proof, speak to your email supplier, make sure your work/uni IT dept know and, provisionally speak to a police officer. We ended up filing a provisional report the evening before we had to see my friend's ex, which basically meant if he breached the peace or acted intimidatingly or aggressively, he'd be instantly arrested and charged.

Hope that helps!!!  |-| 
|-| cogk4jp || 3 || I side with [u/idiosyncrassy](http://reddit/com/user/idiosyncrassy) in that he likely installed spyware on your computer and you need to change all of your account information on a completely separate computer that he doesn't have access to. 

After that, power down your normal computer and keep it safe, but don't use it to log onto anything. (You may want to use it nonchalantly for things that do not require you revealing any passwords or personal info in order to avoid arousing his suspicion.) There's valuable evidence on it. Contact an expert in computer forensics if you can afford one and a lawyer ASAP, because he's breaking a bunch of anti-hacking laws. Either way, get the police involved.  |-| 
|-| cogfjjp || 4 || Good for her! I need to learn to do this too. And good for you for encouraging her to do this.  |-| 
|-| cogkp8o || 3 || I like the change in tone.  Either way it is a touchy situation that is sure to make someone mad...but being more direct is better.

I am entering this conversation from the perspective of a male, and I will tell you that you are on the road to a typical 'women hurting themselves' situation.

The real solution has to include the other person learning how to collaborate properly.  Your sister cannot become 'responsible for Google Docs' because that is just one step down the road to bigger problems.  If her co-worker can't cut it, then she needs to either train the co-worker how to use the system, or avoid taking responsibility for the co-workers mess.

Really, I've seen women go down this path many times- trying to take the responsibility (control?) onto themselves and killing themselves to make it 'perfect' despite their co-worker.  You can't do it!  Now you will forever be in charge of these Google Docs.  

Work on the doc together.  Yes, the other person may make mistakes- but teaching them how to use the system is important.  Your sister needs to lose some of the control but gain in collaboration.  This is a risk.  Your sister will sit in a meeting groaning, while the Doc is shown to be a complete mess.  Frankly, as a man this is what I would do.  Sit there silently...If the boss is aware, they will know who is capable and who is not.  Do NOT point the finger publicly though...strong people don't need to do this and it looks bad.

How can you ever move up in the workplace, if you are in charge of formatting Google Docs?  You can work on the file...but don't be responsible for it.  Sad to say, but it's a low-level and small-minded task- leave it to someone else.  But, how about being known as the person who trained other people on new technology?  That's forward thinking.

If you want to be assertive, then only concentrate on the PURPOSE of the document and push forward.  If your co-worker can't cut the mustard, people will notice.  If you spend all of your time cleaning up their messes...then you'll never move forward.  But again...what if you can solve the problem- not by taking over the docs, but by training other people how to do it themselves?!?!?

If there are gender issues holding women back- this is one of them.  Learn to be assertive and excel, but don't be the housemaid cleaning up after someone else.  Because while you are screwing around with Google Docs, someone else will be doing something far more important to the mission of the organization.  

That's the real glass ceiling.
