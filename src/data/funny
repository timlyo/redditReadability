Statistics show that blacks get far longer sentences than whites for the same exact crimes and also the sentence is longer when the crime was commited against a white person. For example if a black guy robbed a black guy in the street it would be less a charge than if that black man robbed a white man in the street.

This stuff still happens every day and it's backed up with evidence. The court system and the police force are bias and racist. They can say they are not all they want but the proof is in the pudding (statistics.) you racist folk like to set in your nice suburb and get your bias views of looting from Fox News. Also you same idoits will say shit like this but giving a white man a lesser sentence than a black man for the same crime is down right wrong. There is no justifying that like you all seem to think cops killing kids is justified due to how rough kids are in inner cities.   |-|

|-| cnuahcz || 11 || I knew an old woman that stabbed a black man after he tried to mug her (she was pregnant at the time) back in the late 30s, and she managed to hit a vital organ, so the man bled out in the alleyway. She told the police, they found the body, then just shrugged and closed the case. As she put it, "Back then, nobody would bat an eye if a black man ended up murdered in an alley." |-|

Not enough to kill them just enough to give em a little zap and knock them out of the tree. Hes also an angry old German man missing fingers on 1 hand so shaking his fist at the squirrels is his way of giving them the finger. Its pretty hilarious  |-|

edit: jesus christ people are pedantic here.

|-| cnuhoxs || -3 || My Grandfather smoked his whole life and when I was about 17 years old my Mother told him: "If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate you better quit smoking NOW." My Grandfather threw his cigerettes in the garbage immediately. Unfortunately it was too late and 3 years later my Grandfather died of lung cancer. I fell to the ground, on my knees with tears raining from my eyes, I vowed to never touch another cigarette. My Mother even begged me to stop smoking so that my family doesn't have to go through this pain ever again. 10 years later, I am now 27 and I haven't smoked a single cigarette since I made that vow. Looking back I regret not smoking for those 10 years, because Dr. Poon gave me cancer anyways﻿ |-|

Then you have the fact that next month is black history month, which would allow them to show MLK at their leisure.

The history channel is for profit and is just going to play what get them views. |-|

So I park at my apartment with them sticking up like that. Next day I see someone else with the wipers up. It's snowing off and on all week and as the week goes on, I see more and more cars doing this. A bout 1/2 the lot was doing it.

The next week got hot and the snow melted. So there were many days where my wipers were popped out with no snow anywhere before I got that fuse replaced.


I found it funny that everyone followed my lead thinking I was doing it because of the weather only to realize I was just an idiot with broken wipers. I didn't see anyone try it the next snowstorm.

|-| cnunsp4 || 16 || Hello, Australian here - storytime!

My partner and I were traveling across the US/Canada in an RV we hired in December last year. While we were in Canada, we were warned about 'freezing rain' but didn't really know what it meant - we thought they were talking about hail. So when we woke up in our RV the next morning, and realized the doors were all frozen shut, it was a big surprise.

I had to kick the side door open, and slowly clear the ice from the RV, from the windscreen, exhaust ports, front of the radiator, everywhere. As an Australian, it was unlike anything I'd ever experienced, and something I'll always remember.

Also, driving out of the icy parking lot with a 25 foot RV sideways was a hell of a lot of fun! |-|

|-| cnus51e || -16 || Once a man was woken up by the sound of people in his backyard. He observed them trying to break into his shed. The man calls the cops and explains the situation. The operator says "sorry, no units are available right now, we'll send one over when we can". So the man hangs up, and calls again 1 minute later. "You don't have to send the cops anymore, I killed them kids that were breaking into my shed". 6 police cars were on the scene within 1 minute. They found the 2 kids, alive, and promptly arrested them. The police then questioned the man "I thought you said you killed these boys?" to which the man replied "I thought you said no one was available".

Another fun story is that of the convict. Serving a life sentence, he sometimes exchanges mail from his family, which is screened for hidden messages. His father writes that he is going to close the farm, because in his old age and failing health, he can no longer till the soil. The son feels bad because he can't help his father while in jail, so he writes back to his father, saying "don't dig up the soil near the tomato patch, that's where I buried the bodies". A few weeks later he gets another letter "thank you son! many police officers came to my farm and tilled all the soil for me!" |-|

The son feels bad because he can't help his father while in jail, so he writes back to his father, saying "don't dig up the soil near the tomato patch, that's where I buried the bodies". A few weeks later he gets another letter "thank you son! many police officers came to my farm and tilled all the soil for me!" |-|

|-| cnxg6ao || 3 || Don't be fooled: Llamas are vicious.

Backstory:  A few summers ago I was working as a counselor at a camp that had llamas living on-site.  My group was doing a scavenger hunt, which led us over to the sand volleyball court where the llamas were hanging out.  I, like many others, started petting the llamas.  Everything was chill while I was petting the llama, but when I turned to leave the llama reared up on its hind legs and slammed its front feet into my back.  The force of the blow combined with the unstable loose sand made me fall flat on my face, and then the llama proceeded to step right on the middle of my back.  I hopped up and started backing away, but the llama followed.  I broke into a full fledged jog, with the llama loping after me.  Eventually, the llama gave up and left.

TL;DR: Got attacked by a ~~ostrich~~ llama. |-|

You can unlock it by using a perfect 120v sine wave through either Frequency Modulation (FM) or Microwave. Most households have a microwave, and as the name suggests it produces microwaves. Do NOT put your phone in a microwave that isn't producing perfect sine wave voltage (i.e. If you are running it from a generator without a power conditioner). If you have a microwave that is powered by a grid, you're probably fine. It will reset the password and you will be fine. I suggest 3 seconds in the microwave.

After a year, they came back in and laid concrete sidewalks were all the worn paths were.

|-| cnxpl67 || 2089 || I think you guys are missing the point (and this is why we have this textbook, not to say that it should be $250).

The deeper underlying point is that when people engage in voluntary exchanges, the transaction is *positive sum*. 

Note that most people—including a huge number, if not the majority of people on Reddit—don't actually know this. They believe that trade is a zero sum game: i.e., in order for one to gain, another must lose. That is why many people believe that getting rich is *ipso facto* objectionable because it means taking more of the pie or the total amount of money for yourself. Gaining wealth is to the detriment of others, because less is left over for everyone else. 

On the contrary, the point of recognizing exchanges as being value creating (positive sum) is that when people voluntarily trade, you actually *grow* the size of the pie, because you are producing value on both sides.

There are a ton of other political philosophical implications here, too. I won't go into them in depth, but this motivated a lot of the philosophical underpinnings of the world we have today. The original defences of classical liberalism were all based on this proto-utilitarian observation: that free exchange, free trade and voluntarism (as opposed to coerced or forced exchanges, as governments impose) actually maximize people's preferences, value, and thus wealth and well-being. *All from this little observation...*

The point here is that what appears to be something so stupid and obvious is actually quite deep. |-|

General private trackers have some stuff too, try places like TL or DH and trackers like them. Reddit's private tracker BaconBits has a nice collection of eBooks too.

Also, don't forget that What.CD and Waffles.FM both have a huge selection of eBooks.

IRC (Don't overlook this)

irc://irc.undernet.org/bookz

irc://irc.irchighway.net/ebooks

If you don't know how to use IRC to download books, check out this link or read this:

&gt;IRC Guide

&gt;You obviously need an IRC client installed, a quick google search should find you a bunch of decent free ones.

&gt;Load up the client and then type:

&gt;/server irc.irchighway.net

&gt;This will connect you to the irchighway server. Once you're on there, type:

&gt;/join #ebooks

&gt;This will take you into the ebooks channel, which has more than 2.2Terabytes of ebooks for free download. Once you're in, all you have to do to find what you want is to simply type:

&gt;@search "Author or book title"

&gt;... removing the inverted commas.

&gt;You'll get a message saying that your search has been accepted. A few seconds later a searchbot will offer you a file, so accept the download. That will send you a .txt file that's zipped. Extract that and you'll get a list of files. I searched for Lian Hearn and got a list of 147 files. Here's an extract from it:

&gt;!bald Lian Hearn - [Tales Of The Otori 02] - Grass For His Pillow .rar - 142.1 KB !bald Lian Hearn - Tales of the Otori 2 - Grass for His Pillow (CO.rar - 355.3 KB !bald Lian Hearn - Tales of the Otori 2 - Grass for His Pillow (ht.rar - 140.54 KB !bald LianHearn-[Otori_01]-Across_The_Nightingale_Floor(v3).rar - 111.62 KB !bald Lian_Hearn-[Otori_01]-Across_the_Nightingale_Floor(v4.0.rar - 115.45 KB !bald Lian Hearn - [Tales Of The Otori 03] - Brilliance Of The Moo.rar - 175.53 KB !bald Lian Hearn - [Tales Of The Otori 04] - The Harsh Cry of the Heron (v1.0) (html).rar - 351.80 KB !bald Lian Hearn - [Tales Of the Otori 05] - Heaven's Net Is Wide (v5.0) (epub).rar - 588.40 KB

&gt;Say I wanted to download the first book. I'd copy the text shown below, deliberately removing the file size information (I've been booted for that before ):

&gt;!bald Lian Hearn - [Tales Of The Otori 02] - Grass For His Pillow .rar

&gt;Then just paste that into the IRC window then press enter. After 2-3 seconds you get a prompt asking you to accept or decline the file.You know how to do the rest.

|-| cnxtjei || 3 || Funny that it is a microeconomics textbook. I'm working on a project right now to write a microeconomics textbook that is released into the public domain. This textbook will be free forever and not subject to ANY copyright (unlike creative commons which has restrictions). Despite what some say, there is absolutely nothing stopping us from writing our own textbooks and giving them away for free. We don't need for-profit textbooks anymore.

[here is the wiki for the textbook](http://publicversity.com/microeconomics/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) 

If you know a lot about microeconomics then please help us write it. Even if don't know microeconomics, you can still help by editing grammar and other errors. Right now I am the only one writing but the wiki is open (no registration required) if anyone feels like this is a good idea. I have a small budget (my own money) for the project but I am saving it for specific tasks, like hiring someone to create a nice looking title page. |-| 
|-| cnxtnh4 || 153 || Time to reintroduce Reddit to [this lovely couple.](http://i.imgur.com/vtkhW.jpg)

[Original post.](http://np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/h7csd/i_have_no_words/) |-| 
|-| cnxu67z || 3 || Yeah, with a name like Sharon Adams… I'd bully her too. For sure. |-| 
|-| cnxu88d || 4 || You laugh, but it's shocking how many people just don't understand this. They remain convinced that businesses exist to exploit money from people in exchange for nothing. This comes from the very flawed view that wealth is measured in dollar signs. Dollar signs are merely a medium of exchange by which wealth may be transferred from someone who had it to someone who needs it more. What then is wealth? Wealth is simply the increase in standard of living that comes from the possession of some good or the receipt of some service. 

Thus when my mechanic, with whom I have a firm enough and comfortable enough friendship for this not to be awkward, remarked, "Sweet! I just got $400 richer!" After I paid him for the brake job he did, I remarked, "yeah, and I just got working-breaks richer." He was quite refreshed by this perspective. |-|

|-| cnxute1 || 5 || You can restore it to unlock it, it will erase everything in it but it will be functional. It's called a recovery or DFU restore. I will add the steps below, if you need further instructions just google "recovery restore" or "DFU restore" there are many links and videos online:

1. Connect iPod to computer with iTunes via your USB charging cable.

2. While connected to computer, with iTunes open hold down the top (sleep wake) and bottom (home) buttons down until the screen goes black, wait about 6-11 seconds and let go of the top button and continue holding the bottom button.

3. The computer will tell you that there is a device in recovery mode and at that point will give you the option to "restore" (erase) the device.

4. Restore device, this will update, erase and unlock the device.

5. The computer will let you know when the device is fully restored

6. Once restored just proceed with set up. If you backed up your information either via iCloud or iTunes you can now restore from said back up.

7. If backed up on iCloud you can use your Apple ID to sign in and it will show you the last back up available. If you backed up on iTunes, just plug the device into the machine that has your back up and the computer will recognize it as a new device and give you the option to restore from the last backup. If you didn't backup anywhere then this is a good time to start fresh and start backing up. 

I hope this helps!!!!  I attached a link to a YouTube video with steps and an apple support article with the same steps! Kids will be kids, I hope you don't go too hard on them!

Then they're in a penguin courtroom where the judge is a crested penguin in a gown with a wig on. When case is closed the penguin owes the victim 1,000 pebbles. The theif penguin gets pissed off and hires a leopard seal to take out the victim. That's as far as i've gotten.  |-|

I also taught an 11-year-old boy how to knit. Don't even ask me how I pulled that one off!

edit: by "kids" I did mean teens like the one in the OP. I feel like I'm old enough now to call anyone under 18 a "kid". *I have earned this.*

|-| cobor72 || 1993 || So my cat would not stop meawing and begged to go outside. I let him out, night comes, I call him but he doesn't come. It gets late and I go to sleep. The little asshole used a tree to climb on thep 1st story roof, and from there he got to the window of my bedroom. Ripped the bug screen and started to hellishly meaw,  at 2 am,  8 feet outside from were I sleep. I've never woke up so scared and confused before. The fucker also triped the sensor on the outside light and he had similar expression on his face. Was debating if I should open the window to let him in.

|-| cobt6sc || 90 || 10/10 would not let that cat inside. |-| 
|-| cobtugt || 44 || I lived on the second floor of an apartment in my early 20's and my cat liked to go out on the balcony and observe the world. She'd stay out for hours and liked to sleep under the bed when she came in.  So not seeing her out wasn't uncommon. 

One night my ex and I had turned in and somewhere in the mix of getting ready for bed the other had thought the cat had been let in. 

We both went to bed and about 3 AM we heard the cat crying in her most helpless meow and could hear it was pouring buckets outside.  We ran to the back door and opened the slider but no cat.  We searched frantically and wondered if she was caught under the bed and still couldn't find her. 

My ex opens the front door and in comes the cat completely soaked.  She'd jumped from the top (2nd floor) onto the grass then gone around the building (which had 12 units 6 up/6 down) and picked the right door.  We'd never let her out front and nothing was different from one front landing to the next but she picked the right one and was at our door.

1. Put both lids of the toilet up and add 1/8th cup of pet shampoo to the water bowl.

2. Pick up the cat and soothe him while you carry him towards the bathroom.

3. In one smooth movement, put the cat in the toilet and close the lid. (You may need to stand on the lid.)

4. At this point, the cat will self agitate and make ample suds. Never mind the noises that come from the toilet. The cat is actually enjoying this!

5. Flush the toilet three or four times. This provides a "Power Wash" and "Rinse".

6. Have someone open the front door of your home. Be sure that there are no people between the bathroom and the front door.

7. Stand well back, behind the toilet as far as you can, and quickly lift the lid.

8. The cat will rocket out of the toilet, streak through the bathroom, and run outside where he will dry himself off.

9. Both the toilet and the cat will be sparkling clean.

Sincerely,

The Dog |-| 
|-| cobnu2e || 50 || This is why dog bathers tie your dog to the wall when washing them. It's true, they do it. And while we groom your dog, too. And sometimes we muzzle the little shits if they bite, but we take them off as soon as you arrive because gawd forbid you could have warned us that your "shmoopie poopie" is secretly a velociraptor. |-| 
|-| cobn9p0 || 47 || My pug will usually get in the shower with me. Of course, I have to be naked, because he wants me IN the shower as he's getting his shower. He always looks sad, but it beats the desperate eyes of sadness if I kneel next to the tub instead. And he won't try to get out when I'm in there. 

Then inevitably my husband checks in on us and complains that HE never gets to shower with me. Then my dog gets a real happy smug look on his face and I realize this was his plan all along. 

I wish I was kidding.  |-|

|-| cobs7d2 || 9 || I remember when i moved in with my father, he has a cat and that poor thing hated to be brushed. with cat hair everywhere I took matters in to my own hands. First i trimmed his nails, then took him in to the bathroom, closed the door and proceeded to wait until he calmed down. Once I got him calm I took him in to the bath and washed the shit out of him. I'll never forget how my father told me that was the softest he had ever felt his cat before, also the cat loves the brush now.

TL;DR Moved in with dad, washed cat, silky smooth cat. |-| 
|-| cobi951 || 23 || When it's his bath time I tell my dog to get in the tub and stay. He then chills out there until the bath is done and let's me towel him dry. It was really easy to get him to this, do some people have a horrible time bathing their dogs? |-|

Because of this my wife thought that on the first night we had her that she needed a bath (because she did).  Well a 6 month old lab wet puppy is harder to keep still then we thought. As soon as we got her in the tub she jumped out and ran right on the couch. Needless to say we learned this the hard way.  |-|

|-| cobmgjg || 923 || Medical doctor here with a (serious) explanation:

The digital rectal exam is a terrible test. It only allows you to feel less than half the prostate. However, if I feel something on the prostate, like a nodule or a mass, it is quite likely a cancer. But if I feel nothing, you could easily still have a cancer I can't feel. The risk of me doing this test is almost 0 and if I do feel something it could save a life (more on that later). I do this test almost daily and yes, that includes today. 

Why isn't there a better test yet? Well, it's not for lack of trying. A blood test called the PSA was developed but unfortunately it is very frequently positive without a cancer being there. If you have an elevated PSA it means you have to go for a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. This means someone sticking needles up your butt to take biopsies of the prostate. 90% of the time, no cancer is found. This biopsy has significant complications as you can imagine. If they detect a cancer, and you decide to have your prostate removed, that surgery has even more complications, potentially even more so that just letting that cancer grow.

Why?

While prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men among non-smokers, it also primarily affects older men in their 70s and is typically very slow growing, leaving a large window to detect the disease before it'll actually kill a person. 

It was found the PSA test DID detect more cancers, but didn't increase the overall survival of people having the test because most of these men were older, had heart or lung disease, and would have died of something else before the cancer ever would have. It is a decent test in high risk individuals (blacks or people with a family history). When people go for physicals I explain all this to them and let them decide if they want to deal with a positive test result.

**TL,DR: Our screening tests for prostate cancer suck because it usually affects older men who are going to die of something else, and it is frequently positive without a cancer being there subjecting people to potentially harmful tests or surgeries. The key is finding a test that reliable picks up cancers in young men, that test does not exist as yet.**

That said, this cartoon is hilarious, accurate, and incredibly humbling. |-|

There are two main reason why this technique is still used today. 

Firstly, the physician inserts a lubricated finger into the rectum through the anus and palpates the insides in order to diagnose  rectal tumors and other forms of cancer.

Secondly, the finger is used because it's smaller than my massive cock. |-|

|-| cobjzku || 39 || I go to nursing school, and my professor who is an MD said that the rectum is only so big, and finger is only so little. You're not feeling the entire rectum for abnormalities, but most of the times you are able to detect it if the abnormalities are close to the anus. 

However, if the abnormalities are deeper than your finger can go, and you're only sticking a finger up there, you won't know there is something wrong. 

My professor said, "So you're literally half-assing it." 

Edit: Adding on to say, not that sticking a finger up the rectum isn't efficient. It definitely can be; do that but also do a blood test to measure PSA levels. |-|

Look at it this way. With the traditional prostate exam, there are absolutely zero cons. No risks, no costs, no delays. And it may save a life. So why the fuck wouldn't we do it? |-|

That was 4 years ago. [Here's an example from today at TARGET of that same style] (http://www.target.com/p/cherokee-men-s-chambray-button-down-blue/-/A-16533814#prodSlot=_1_59).  |-|

so....why don't these ever go anywhere?  I mean...I see these pics, and they're just shit.  People know they're shit.   You walk around and you see people every day.  They look normal, buying normal stuff.  you don't see this shit for sale anywhere, ever.  It's almost like these fashion shows are:

 "lets create some goofass design that even a homeless person wouldn't be paid to wear" 

I've seen expensive shit.  Have you seen the prices of a ralph lauren purple label?  How about [$995 for a damn sweater](http://www.ralphlauren.com/product/index.jsp?productId=52096166&amp;cp=54803326.57080826&amp;ab=ln_men_cs_purplelabelnewarrivals&amp;parentPage=family) which doesn't look that it could be that much better than the [$400 brooks brothers shirt](http://www.brooksbrothers.com/Cashmere-Cable-Crewneck-Sweater/MS00591,default,pd.html?dwvar_MS00591_Color=NAVY&amp;contentpos=18&amp;cgid=0224) which still doesn't look much better than the ["on sale" $50 v-neck sweater](http://www.ralphlauren.com/product/index.jsp?productId=43537546&amp;cp=1760781.1760813&amp;view=99&amp;ab=ln_men_cs_sweaters&amp;s=A-StorePrice-POLO&amp;pg=1&amp;parentPage=family). 

I guess that what I'm saying is that if a sweater can range from $50-$1,000...how god damn much is a stupid pair of slacks with ridiculous  oompa loompa flares at the bottom?  any why do they keep truing out pure garbage during these?   |-| 
|-| cob7x7v || -7 || Cue all the people trying to defend the high fashion industry by desperately trying to explain that this is meant to be like abstract art in fashion... The difference is (of course) that people actually like abstract art

|-| coghly6 || 454 || That would scare the bejesus out of me too |-| 
|-| cognzto || 319 || Dogs are definitely programmed to recognize and fear the predator silhouette. My golden retriever encountered a stone statue of a lion in someone's yard one day and jumped about five feet sideways. I can only imagine what her reaction would be if it had moved.  |-| 
|-| cogih0f || 196 || I think you can pinpoint the moment the dog's soul leaps out of his chest |-| 
|-| cogn8bz || 637 || This is why leashes are important people! Even if the dog is friendly they should be on a leash for their own safety. |-|

|-| cogp7lz || 82 || I saw this on America's Funniest Home Videos before I saw it on Reddit. That's pretty sad. |-| 
|-| cogigch || 59 || If it wasn't for the leash that dog would have gotten himself run over. |-| 
|-| cogo583 || 6 || And that's why you walk with a leash on your dog. |-| 
|-| cogon5p || 5 || I had an English Mastiff that I just couldn't take on walks during Halloween/Christmas because of lawn decorations.  |-| 
|-| cogpqbj || 5 || My local Goodwill had the same thing on display during October.

|-| cogodjf || -8 || Get a real dog. |-| 
|-| coge1od || 863 || They are specifically going after the "business lunch" business...these people have fax machines, large orders, and tip better than your average college student. If you've ever tried to put together an order for an office - a fax is much easier. Once you have it written down you are done. |-| 
|-| coge86b || 154 || These are really useful if you're ordering for a load of people in the office, you just pass the form around, get everyone to fill in what they want, and then fax it over. It's actually way easier than one person taking everyone's order and relaying it over the phone. |-| 
|-| cogd0cx || 192 || Oh my god I fucking love taco del mar. I recently moved to the east coast and there is no good mexican food. And don't give me that, "Chipotle is so goood" bullshit. They have like 6 ingredients. If there's a business exec reading this, I'm a white male, age 18-45, and like taco del mar. |-| 
|-| cogeplu || 10 || Chipotle does this in the business districts near me. |-| 
|-| cogj29j || 19 || I know people increasingly expect to have an app or website to order food from their favorite restaurants, but that can be incredibly expensive for the business owner. I work as a software engineer and make stuff like this all the time. Doing it *right* costs upwards of $30k (usually a lot more). You might be able to get *something* done by using one of the pre-built platforms for this for under $10k, but those generally suck and usually lack the customization that most people eventually want, especially when trying to do things like set up special kinds of deals.

A fax form is basically free because every restaurant already has a fax machine. It's also easier to use and doesn't require an account. Sometimes low-tech is better. |-| 
|-| cogfqir || 5 || There is a deli near my work where you can fax your orders in.  If you don't call to confirm they got your fax, odds are they wont get your order.  Kinda defeats the point. |-| 
|-| coggim6 || 5 || What a time to be alive! |-| 
|-| cogas8r || 32 || "Don't have a FAX machine yet? You may also TELEGRAPH your order to us! Operators standing by!" |-| 
|-| cogchbm || 4 || "Then call us with your credit card." |-| 
|-| cogdvcd || 4 || My office recently upgraded, now I send an email to have someone else fax something for me. Progress. |-| 
|-| cogfhjk || 4 || CAFE FUCKING RIO |-| 
|-| coglhtq || 4 || My office has done this with restaurants.  It's so easy especially with like Chipotle because you can just pass the order sheet around and each person writes they're name on it and circles all the things they want and then you just fax it.  No need for one person to call and read a laundry list of things off to someone who has to copy it all down. |-|

|-| cog8ha7 || 209 || Lol. On the up side, i hear standing desks will prolong your life. 
So. You can stand at desks for longer.  |-| 
|-| cog7l24 || 59 || I have a standing desk at work.  I stand in the middle of the room whilst all the other pawns sit around me.  |-| 
|-| cog8qfw || 70 || As someone who has back injuries because of prolonged hours of sitting at a desk. Use them. Stand up as much as you can bear. This is especially important if your workday might have you behind the desk all day. |-| 
|-| cog7spt || 34 || Sit or stand desks are where it's at.  |-| 
|-| cog8anr || 14 || We have elecrtrical desks that we can lower and raise. Quite nice to be standing some days. |-|

It was discovered in the territory which would later come to be known as Colorado (the 41st state) by Jacob Aspen a noted philanthropist and early explorer. Contrary to popular belief the tree was not discovered in the town of Aspen, although the town does take its name from Jacob Aspen who settled there and served as the first mayor. |-| 
|-| cogv4zl || 16 || Mountain cougars and biting goats!! |-| 
|-| cogvyp5 || 30 || I handed my resignation in a few weeks ago and was beginning to doubt my decision...  
But then I got told that one of the students in my class is desperately close to flunking *all* of his classes, and if he flunks even 1 of them he will have to repeat the school year.  
At first, I was taken aside privately and told that it would be in "everyone's best interests" to just give him the bare minimum grade to pass him...  
Then, we had an actual teacher's meeting called to talk about this *one* student and how all teachers should be aware he's at risk for not graduating and to fudge his marks a bit, because he's such an awful student they'd rather just push him over the finish line and be done with him.  
While this annoyed me a bit, I shrugged and agreed.  
But last week we had our oral examination and he shows up to the exam having not prepared or studied a thing. He would have gotten a 2% on the exam had he been marked fairly and I had to give him a 50. I wanted to slit my wrists.  
Then today we had the written exam.  
The fucking kid writes his name on the exam, briefly flips through the whole thing, does a few guesswork answers at the multiple choice and then falls asleep. He's going to get like, a 0 on his final.  
Annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd we're just gonna pass him.  
Yeah - fuck teaching.  
Edit: I asked him what he planned to do after graduation and he said "go to university". Considering the culture here, where parents pay for their kids to go to uni, I feel pretty bad for them. What a waste.  |-|

Towards the end of our trip we were driving around Westmeath looking for a prehistoric megalith and we found ourselves on a truly single lane road with a speed limit of 50 km/h. The road (like many roads in Ireland) was ridiculously curvy so I was going slow. Out of nowhere a guy comes flying around a curve and we manage to both stop literally inches from each other. It was terrifying and batshit insane. However, having spent the previous month in Ireland dealing with irish drivers, I wasn't too shaken and we managed to go around each other and go about our days. That, to me, is Ireland. Batshit-insane fast when you stop worrying about everything and insanely terrifying but strangely ok when the shit hits the fan. Great country. 10/10. 
 |-| 
|-| cogr4d4 || 5 || The two times I've been to Ireland, the drivers are crazy. They don't care about the speed limit. They drive however fast they want, and if they're speeding and someone in front of them isn't, they're described as needing "f*ckin' inspiration"

Not that he doesn't work in the jokes, as seen above, but they're there to help the presentation of something greater rather than being the end goal themselves.

|-| cogigfk || 38 || As someone who works in the biopharmaceutical industry, this is so false. The companies spend millions upon millions of dollars to try to create an effective drug. Many companies develop the backbone of their drug early on and then spend years making it more potent and safe for human trials. If we didn't give a shit, we'd market the drug after the first round.  But first it has to be effective in vitro, then in vivo-- in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, monkeys-- then it has to pass several phases in humans. That shit cost millions of dollars. That's why a lot of smaller biopharms get bought out by big pharma (merck, pfizer etc) because they see a new drug they can add to their income and they have the ability/budget to market a new drug. There's a lot of hate for pharmaceutical companies on Reddit but in my 5 years experience, it's a bunch of passionate scientists trying to save lives and provide an answer for a medical need. So fuck off. |-|

Four times the money, ten times the leisure time, and I am treated so much better now than I ever was as a teacher. I look forward to the day that prostitution is considered a legitimate profession, and that this joke improv conversation wouldn't even raise eyebrows.   |-|

A big problem with the teaching profession is people who do it because they can't think of what else to do/think it'll be easy. It's an all in job.  |-|

My life goal is to travel the world selling proper tacos and burritos. Btw, that's not how my mom made tacos, that's a burrito lol. |-| 
|-| cog9u8p || 13 || I am amazed that you found a cafe selling tacos at all... |-| 
|-| cog8niw || 37 || I'm a Texan living in Boston. They like to call things "wraps" but really they are just tacos.  |-| 
|-| cog1t4g || 129 || A common point of confusion due to an unfortunate homophone. What you're looking at is actually a French taqeaux. Inside, you'll usually find some type of pan fried meat, a starch (rice, bread, oats, etc.), and mirepois (chopped celery, carrots, and onion). The grill marks are applied purely for visual appeal and are usually pressed in when the dish is ready to be served with a hot, patterned block of iron called a *menteur.* |-| 
|-| cog1mv1 || 58 || Because that's where you go for good Mexican food...

Europe.

In your defense, I was in Amsterdam and went to a Mexican restaurant because I missed home (the southwest).  It was wretched.

|-| cogf04f || 8 || I am from Texas and visited a friend in Belgium a few years ago, and we went to Paris on the Thalys train for the day. He insisted that we have Mexican food, so we ended up at this Mexican restaurant in the food court of a mall in La Défense. He immediately told the waitress that I was from Texas and would be eagerly judging what they brought out. I was mortified. 

The chips and salsa were some Doritos dumped in a bowl and a very tiny serving of what I believed to be plain tomato paste. I got the enchiladas and they were corn tortillas filled with sauteed zucchini and mushrooms in some kind of delicate cream sauce. Maybe like an alfredo sauce with cumin in it. The chef kept peeping out the door and looking at me, wearing a little white chef's hat. I told the waitress it was good, and she reported it back to the chef. It was pretty good, but it was nothing like Tex-Mex or Mexican food. 

I highly recommend for any Texans visiting Paris to have 'Mexican' food there, it's a really interesting experience.  |-| 
|-| cogcpba || 13 || I am also a Texan who used to live in France. Whenever you need to get your spicy fix, go to one of those Moroccan sandwich shops (they're there, promise) and ask them for the hottest sauce they have. When they try to give you Samurai sauce, or whatever they have in the deli, tell them, no, hotter. There's this stuff they kept in the back, this tiny jar of red stuff, and they put in about an 1/8 of a teaspoon for the whole sandwich. 

It will make you sweat, cry, clear your sinuses, and feel at home. 

Also, if you get lonely, find the Irish expats and go to their pubs. There's whiskey, singing, dancing, fighting, banjos and fiddles - just what a growing Texan needs when France feels just a little too posh for its own good. 

Also, though I never wear big buckles at home, over there s big, shiny Texas buckle made me so many friends and got me so many free drinks. They love that cowboy stuff - like the modern equivalent of the knight chivalric tales they all grew up on. Don't be scared to say things like, "ça va, y'all?"  |-|

|-| cog7ccc || 3 || In 1999, my wife and daughter (also Texans) had a serious craving for Mexican in Edinburgh, Scotland -- where they actually found a decent restaurant run by a Texan.  They were pleasantly surprised.

In 1980, I tried to eat Mexican at a restaurant in Arkansas -- a state adjoining Texas.  They got it abominably wrong.  Oredering Mexican outside of Texas is a real crapshoot. |-|

It is named [Stars 'N' Bars](http://goo.gl/maps/hyP8c). They had a big sign out front reading, "English spoken here." Of course I had to venture inside. |-|

|-| coge3su || 6 || I am from Europe and living in the States right now, the one thing I love about America is that you can order Hot Dogs, Pizza, Fried Chicken, just about anything that is considered 'American' food and you will find that it can change based on region and in some cases from county to county. It's amazing and I think many American's take it for granted. I've lived in the US for quite a bit now and I am a citizen so I may be biased but I think the food here is pretty good once you get away from anything prepackaged. Food you eat at decent restaurants and at other peoples homes tends to be awesome. Americans get a bad rap when it comes to food when honestly it's no worse than any of the more 'cultured' places in Europe because I've had horrible food the world over, including France. |-|

"The legendary Hayman is a 100-year-old white sweet potato that was once widely grown on the Eastern Shore. It's a difficult crop with a low yield, so it's not easy to find. Haymans, smaller than the other varieties tested, are tan and oddly shaped with bumps and raised areas of skin that look like raised veins on the back of someone's hand. Inside, they are white like a russet potato. The flesh is denser than the others when baked and somewhat fibrous with a distinctly sweeter taste."
