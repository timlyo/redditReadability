|-| cntuitb || 40 || Greetings from capacity management at LSGG!

ATCOs often give pilot direct routings or other deviations from the filed flightplan, presumably in order to help the pilot save time. However, these flightplan deviations can have an adverse effect on the workload of ATCOs downstream. Especially when flow management procedures are in place and the flow of traffic is regulated to spread out entries into an overloaded sector, flights not adhering to their flightplan can greatly reduce the effectiveness of the flow management measures.

So my question then is: When giving direct routings to pilots, are ATCOs aware of the potential negative effects this may have on sector loads elsewhere in the network? How important do you consider flightplan adherence is compared to accomodating pilots by granting requests that deviate from the flightplan? |-|

Why don't they just fly a more direct route and short cut their way to the final approach?  Do you always run the same routes for safety purposes? |-|

I guess to some people it's worth it to go and see whatever hilarious side-show cover band he brings through town. I personally put a little more stock in integrity to be able to take him seriously. 

with glenn at the helm the misfits were one of the most ferocious bands ever, snarling and offensive. jerry has turned it into something else, something I completely cannot relate to.  

he's a devout christian who tours singing all glenn's songs, songs about very non-christian things, for money. plain and simple. 

the new material since the 1995-era band is... it's laughable. american psycho and famous monsters weren't really my bag but at least they were passable. since he's been at the helm alone... it's just shameful. the guy is so ridiculous that even his own brother left and can't stand him. 

and some of your questions aren't even valid. jerry wasn't writing anything in 1978. he was learning the songs glenn wrote and making small stylistic contributions, by his own admission!

so good luck. I'd rather see an AMA request for glenn. I know glenn can be a dick and that's not really in dispute, but whatever you say about the guy, you can't doubt that he WAS the creative mind behind the misfits. jerry has been riding his coattails since 1978. if his music didn't have the misfits name associated with it, he would have nothing.  |-| 
|-| cntvqwh || 4 || Do you ever worry that a pilot's English is too weak when something non-standard comes up? [I'm thinking of the inability of flight 52 in 1990 to declare a fuel emergency.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avianca_Flight_52)

|-| cntvqzj || 24 || Hi there, thank you for doing this AMA.

I'm going to apply to become an ATC next year on Schiphol, Amsterdam the Netherlands.

Why did you choose for the tower position instead of the area or en route? 
Does it fit you better as a person or do you just like the view instead of the radar every day? ;)

 |-| 
|-| cntvr6r || 12 || Are movies and documentaries correct when the plane is in trouble or crashes, air traffic controllers get emotionally invested, get upset and if a plane crashes on your watch, are you in shit and could you be fired?  |-| 
|-| cntvtmi || 12 || I assume you sit about looking at screens all day. So .. office pranks?

 |-| 
|-| cntvv04 || 3 || How prevalent is alcohol use among off-duty ATC's. My understanding is that high-paced radio dispatching work such as yours and also 911 call centers create workers more prone to drink it off in their spare time. 

Is your job stressful? How do you cope with the stress in your free time?

Are there ever conflicts between pilots and ATC's over the air? By that I mean, pilots or ATC's being rude to one another over the air. I worked in private security dispatch and often times the officers were rude or short with me when they had a problem. How are these conflicts resolved?

Do you ever come across language barriers from pilots of international airlines? How are these conflicts resolved? Have you ever needed the services of an interpreter to do your job?

I like to listen to a live stream of ATC traffic against some chill electronic music. Which type of ATC feed would you say is the most interesting for this purpose (ie. ground, approach, ?)

Thanks! |-|

Hello.

In the TV show Breaking Bad (it's an american show, idk if you've seen it) there is an episode where an air traffic controller messes up and two jets hit each other mid air and spew airplane parts and body parts all over the neighborhoods below.

How possible is that? Could an air traffic controller such as yourself accidentally mess up and have two airplanes hit each other? 

Thanks you're the best! |-| 
|-| cntvxic || 6 || Hi! Is the job extremely competitive? The pay seems insane once you're trained and a few years in which is why I assume this (as well as it being pretty cool to work in an airport! :P) Would it be realistic for an 18y/o sixth form leaver to apply?

|-| cntyw10 || 4 || I have a neat little store about Jerry. (will be reposted if he actually does an AMA)

This was in 2000, me and a couple of buddies of mine from high school went to the Del Amo Mall in Torrance, CA. We were Sophomores at the time, so not all that mature. Basically, we were punk kids with mohawks and all that. Anywho...Jerry, Marky Ramone and Dez of Black Flag were doing a public signing at this store called Aahs!(if I remember right), it was like a Hot Topic type of store. So my friends and I go in there and already there were lines forming to meet them. There were stacks upon stacks of Misfits stickers all over the store and I think to myself "Sweet, free Misfits stickers!" Little did I know there were price tags on the back of each sticker. I began hoarding tons of Misfits stickers into my pockets. My buddies and I head out to grab some grub from the food court when a mall security guy stops me and accuses me of shoplifting. He says he has me on camera taking tons of stickers and putting them in my pockets in the store. I tell him that there were tons of free stickers around and as I show them to him I see the price tag on the backs of each sticker and think to myself "Fuck, I can't believe I shoplifted". 

So the security guy takes me to the back of the store and sits me right next to this old guy with long black hair, turns out it was Marky Ramone. He begins telling me what an asshole I am for stealing and I try and tell him it was an accident, that I didn't notice there were price tags on the backs of those stickers...I was just stoked that they were lying around and what I thought were free. So then Jerry comes out from another room and sits on the other side of me(I'm sandwiched between Marky and Jerry at this point) and he says "Hey man, it's alright...kids make mistakes." He then asks if I was hungry and I'm like "yeah, we were on our way to the food court when I got busted by the mall cops". He laughs and then offers me a few slices of Dominos pizza they had lying around that was provided to them by the store. The mall security guy let's me off with a warning, and I go out and tell my buddies what happened when that guy took me to the back of the store. Their jaws dropped and began calling me a dick for stealing stickers and end up getting free pizza by Jerry Only.


**TL;DR: Accidentally steal a bunch of Misfits stickers as teen, get's free pizza by Jerry Only and cussed out by Marky Ramone** |-|

Hey Ethan! For me, the single scariest part of Lost is when you cut off Charlie and Claire in the forest and say "Hello there", specifically because of the [face you make](http://i.imgur.com/U71pJdC.png).

Two questions:

What was it like being the first villain on the show?

Do you wish you had a larger role on Lost? |-| 
|-| cnu09dh || 7 || Hey William. You provided the motion capture (and initially the voice) for Agent 47 in Hitman Absolution. Can you tell us about what it was like to work on that?

Was it disappointing to learn they had decided to reinstate the original voice actor (David Bateson) and dub over your vocal performance?

I've always been fascinated at the fact that whenever you give a talk, you  face the dual expectations of both research results AND a hilarious presentation. That seems, to me, at least twice as burdensome as an ordinary talk.

Does this ever get you down? Have you ever thought, "I can't deliver that research talk yet because I don't have any good jokes for this technical material," or does the humor come so naturally that one doesn't limit the other.

PS - fellow web researcher and former-CSAILor here and I always enjoy reading your new work. Thanks for all the good stuff over the years.  |-| 
|-| cnu1mok || 4 || There's been a great deal of talk about addressing the lack of women in computer science, and far less talk (it seems to me) about addressing the lack of african-americans in computer science. What do you think can and should be done, and how?
(BTW, I'm a computer science postdoc at MIT). |-|

|-| cnu222y || 4 || Hi James, 

I'm someone who aspires to get into CSAIL some day for a PhD (I already have a Master's). I find your achievements very interesting and inspiring. 

1. How would you characterize the industry-academia relationship in the field of distributed systems? I ask because in a recent Machine Learning conference, there was a lot of stink about Zuckerberg showing up to promote Facebook via a talk, but at the same time, one can't deny the advances in computer science that wouldn't have happened so fast if it wasn't for the industry. I wonder what your thoughts are on this. 

2. How do you (and several other academics i know) manage to balance your research with a pretty significant hobby? I'm single, have no kids to worry about, and am just a couple of years into the software industry, and I find it really hard to even devote more than a little time to any hobby I want to pursue seriously. It feels like doing so means you always have to be 'on', and ends up not feeling like downtime at all, apart from wondering if I can't also use that time to catch up on work. How do you manage it? 

3. Why in your opinion is there such a massive under-representation of African-americans and Latinos in programming, and even fewer in STEM academia? Every african-american professor I have learned under has been very kind, very willing to go the extra mile to make their students feel at home (most notably Prof Ian Harris at UC Irvine), and I suppose that comes naturally of people who are minorities.... and as a brown woman, i have noted and appreciated that quality many times over. I see how programming has transformed poor or rural communities in India, in terms of new problems  to solve and new ways of looking at things, and I feel very strongly about encouraging african americans to get started on programming, and giving them role models that they need. What can we do in order to help this happen?  |-|

|-| cnu35m8 || 6 || Hi James,

As a programmer that primarily deals with networks and systems, I just wanted to stop by and let you know that I found your article [The Night Watch](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mickens/thenightwatch.pdf) hilarious. :) I would highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't read it. I re-read it every so often when debugging has put me in a bad mood / made me bleed from my eyes and it never fails to make me feel a bit better.

I guess I need to include a question as this is a top-level comment, so I think I'll ask one that I've been pondering recently after reading through many debates on the topic: What is your opinion on programming languages for systems purposes? Do you see any new languages as a "threat" to dethroning C as the king of systems languages (or, if not new languages like Rust / GO, any updated old languages, for instance C++14/17)? Do you believe that C should still be taught to students in university environments, particularly for things like operating systems courses, or do you think that we should be trying to deliver this material through the vehicle of other languages? |-| 
|-| cnu36wu || 3 || I LOVED you in FDR American Badass and Darnell Dawkins Mouth Guitar Legend. You're so good in comedies. Any chance we will see in more comedies? We quote you all the time. "You've got the polio Frank." |-|

I've found that in an effort to be viewed as a "serious grad student" and not the "token PoC female", I'm suppressing a lot of my personality. When you were in grad school, did you struggle to balance doing "good research" while also feeling like the 'representative' for minorities in CS for your peers? How did you balance your humor with being taken seriously as a computer scientist?  |-|

|-| cnu3r77 || 3 || Hi, James - if you can turn the time machine back to when you were first starting to attend CS conferences and do a bit of extrapolation:  What was the experience like as a young black grad student, especially in ways that might differ from a young highly-represented grad student, and what changes to the conference experience might have improved that?  Corollary:  Are you a fan or non-fan of "diversity"-style workshops and addenda to the conferences?

|-| cnu4l1o || 3 || Hi James! Thanks for doing this AMA. I have a few race-specific questions that I wanted to ask. I'll begin with this:

Due to our country's Euro-centric media, school curriculum, standards of beauty, religion, etc. it is inevitable for racism or more specifically, "internalized superiority complex" to develop subconsciously among the white majority. It also leads to a similar subconscious feeling of inferiority among people of color in America, especially black people. For example, in kindergarten and elementary school when learning about people who serve as symbols of excellence in our society, they are often white and male. What this communicates to young children without explicitly saying it is, in order to be great in this country, you have to be white and male. This phenomenon isn't isolated to just school, either. The most popular comic book heroes for example, are all white men. Jesus Christ, the so-called son of God is even depicted as a white man. It literally is unavoidable in our society. This process is what leads to an internalized feeling of superiority among whites, and an internalized feeling of inferiority among blacks. This process that I'm speaking of is the process of systematic, structural, and institutionalized racism.

With that being said, can you share any of your own experiences with this phenomenon? Did you ever notice it? How do you feel about it at this point in your life?

Did you ever feel pressure to perform at a certain level for fear that you might confirm a negative stereotype about yourself if you did not? 

What was your upbringing like and how did black people react to your interest in programming? How did they react to your interest in rock music?

W.E.B. DuBois believed that being educated and black isolates you from both other blacks and from whites. How do you feel about this? 


Did you at any point in your life ever wish you were white instead of black? 
I ask this because as a 5-year-old black kid in elementary school, I wanted to be white for the reasons that I outlined above.
 |-| 
|-| cnu4oj2 || 4 || Hi James, I've always wanted to ask a researcher this question. 

Is there any room for 'Gentleman Scientists'? (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_scientist) A lot of times, i want to do pure research, the sort you get to work on at Microsoft Research, but those jobs are few and far in between, and usually in the software industry, you don't get to work on what you want. 

I've been wondering about how easy or hard it is to do research independently. I work in machine learning, and with lots of open data sets and cheap infrastructure like AWS and Azure, and using your public library for access to journals and conference proceedings, it seems very possible to just work on this kind of thing on your own time if you have a little bit of drive and some guidance. Which makes me wonder. If this is so easy, why aren't more people doing it? 

I ask this because I've spent the past six years trying to become qualified enough to get hired to work on research problems I like, and while I've made money along the way, no matter where I look, I don't find any places with the sort of flexibility to work on only what I like and  am taking time off for a while, and was wondering about what options I have, as someone who hasn't quite made a name, to work indepdently on things I like.  |-|

Love your writing. "This World of Ours" has become something of a cult piece within the Crypto/Security Community (even getting "Obligatory TWoO" references at [RWC 2015](http://realworldcrypto.com/rwc2015/program-2)). Unfortunately, it created more questions than it answered:

- Do you really think passwords will ever go away?
- Please, dear God, why hasn't anyone killed [PGP](http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/08/whats-matter-with-pgp.html) yet?

And most importantly,

- When can we expect the release of "Gigantic Martian Insect Party: Insurrection"? (Straight to DVD?)

However, if that stigma was reduced, it's possible that more people would file bankruptcy that really just need to learn proper budgeting, not bankruptcy. For that same reason, banks don't want the stigma to go away because a good chunk of their revenue comes from people that are perpetually delinquent.

|-| cnudsui || 3 || Pilot here. Coming into Orly last month rainy/windy evening, 2nd on final. Had an 777 lining up and a EasyJet in front. 777 taking forever to line up, guessing he was heavy that day. 

We had the usual 180kts till 5nm but the easyjet was clearly slowing down early. Easyjet starts to go around as the 777 is half way through the runway. Controller already told us to expect late landing clearance so we continue. The controller starts giving the easy non standard go around instructions and here we are at 300ft. The 777 had taken off and runway was visibly clear. Called short final and got no reply.  Called short final again literally seconds apart still no reply. Captain makes the call and says we're landing, so once again I call "Wings2, runway 26 landing"

Once we vacate he sounds agitated but hands us of to ground as if nothing happened. 

From our point of view:
-Tight on fuel
-Bad weather, getting worse
-Lots of traffic
-Had an easyjet go around right infront
-Runway visibly clear and no one instructed to line up or cross.

No report was filed from their part. The captain and I had a short discussion about it and filed a company report. It was a stressful situation and have given it a lot of thought since it happened, the usual, what could I have done differently.

After all that here is the question. Given that situation I would like to know the point of view of the controller. Had you been in that situation what would have gone through your mind after we had landed? In your eyes (atc controller) did we make the "right" decision? Just your overall view on the situation. |-|

It seems that the cause of much hopelessness the world over is a lack of economic opportunities.

But in many conflict areas, these opportunities are nonexistent (or involve joining an extremist group).

So, 1: What do you think of fostering worker collectives in these areas as a possible solution? They would provide a job, naturally, and the added benefit of owning part of the company keeps a worker personally invested. 

And then 2: How can this start? And what unique blocks does corruption present to this model? |-|

The company looking for funding knows the risks they are facing much more so than a potential partner.  You make it very easy for people to risk their money without understanding the potential downsides they are exposing themselves to and whether the compensation is commensurate with the risks.  For example why are some offers a 5% return while others are a 10% return?

Do you have plans to include a section on "Risks and Challenges"?
Do you intend to provide some sort of metric/analytics on risk/reward and a breakdown of how you come up with a rate of return?
You're basically selling investments without a market price.  If a project fails to reach its fundraising target at a given return will it then be re-offered at a higher return?  Any plans to convert this to an auction structure?

I’m a huge fan of Hey Rosetta! and I’ve seen you perform 6 or 7 times since I first heard your music. Thanks for doing this AMA! I have a couple of questions for you.


Creating music as a band is hard enough, but I imagine it’s extra challenging when your band has 7 members. Can you talk a bit about the collaborative process, how songs are created, etc?


My favorite show I ever saw you play was late at night (3 AM?) on the first night of Bonnaroo in 2012. There were about 80 of us in a little wooded area out by the tents and you played one of the most phenomenal sets/shows I’ve ever seen. Do you remember this show? Was it by chance as special for you as it was for us? 5 of my friends converted to lifelong Hey Rosetta! fans that day.


Lastly, you’ve played a lot of different sized venues with a lot of different bands. Do you find yourselves having “favorite” places to play? Favorite venue sizes? The show you played at Lincoln Hall in Chicago on the Seeds tour was amazing.


Thanks again for taking the time to do this!

I've sent a message in your Facebook page so you could not imagine how excited I were when I read you post about this IAMA.
Well, I listen to your songs every single day, not exaggerating. And I have two questions, first one is about "the simplest thing", do the couple break up at the end of the song? Seriously, this question is taking my sleep away! :)
Second question, what is "Cathedral Bells" about? I love that song :)
Also, please come to New Zealand, we'd live to have you here and I keep my promise and I'd buy you guys a drink :)
Thanks already !

|-| cnv5r21 || 4 || Hey guys!

When I listen to your music, I often find myself thinking about the lyrics and the music from a songwriting perspective.

What does the average start to finish of a Hey Rosetta! song look like?

You guys played two shows in Riverport, Nova Scotia a while back. I was at the first one, and I remember Tim saying that it was the first time you had done a live show in a while. 

You guys rocked it.

Thank you for being a continuing source of my favorite music! |-|

Your song Kintsukuroi, Rural Alberta Advantage's album Mended with Gold, and now Death Cab For Cutie with their new album Kintsugi. All within the span of a year.

|-| cnv5u0f || 16 || Hey guys; 

Huge, huge fan since I saw you and Dan Mangan in 2009 at the Black Lounge at the University of Calgary. My friends and I were front row and it's still one of my best memories from school. It was my first proper 'Canadian Indie' show, and kicked off a non-stop love affair with the amazing music Canada has to offer. 

Second Sight is phenomenal! 

My 2 questions:

1. Second Sight has a very, very different sound when compared to Seeds; a lot more expansive and... mature. Do you guys feel like there was a real change in the way you write your music between the two albums? 

2. Given the calmer, more 'acoustic soundscape' vibe Second Sight seems to put out, do you feel like this has also come through in your (famously high energy) live performances? How have those changed over the years?

I've seen you 6 times now and every single show is amazing. I've also shipped your albums to 7 countries now for friends who I got hooked when I lived abroad. They all agree that Second Sight is another amazing piece of music. 

I can't wait to see you guys play the new stuff in February (and maybe, for your Calgary fans, a few tracks from the old discs too)!

 |-| 
|-| cnv5vnu || 11 || Never heard of your band before. Care explaining what style of music you make and what has influenced you the most? |-| 
|-| cnv5wc5 || 6 || Hi folks! I saw you at Bonnaroo in 2012 and 2014. You definitely left a big impression in 2012. Still a good show in 2014, but it was diminished without the full band. 

1)How did you enjoy playing at Bonnaroo?
2)Why didn’t the full band play in 2014? With it being such a big 
festival I would have thought it would be a big priority.

Peace and love.
Dave

Long time fan! I attended a show you played in Edmonton in 2007, without a clue who you were, at some drunken bar and took a ton of photos that I didn't realize we're of you until your Christmas show in 2011. Ended up falling absolutely in love with your music when I went to MUN and have seen you numerous times since. 

My question is how do you feel performing abroad vs in St. John's. In Pemberton this summer I could really feel the vibe difference, and I wonder how you adjust for that. 

Also, I'm moving to Australia soon and know you have toured there in the past, any chance I will be seeing you abroad in the next couple of years? 

Edit: Also Tim we are birthday twins! I'm always playing your music on July 13th. 
And I attached the album of the photos I never knew I had from 2007. Sorry the one of Adam wasn't the best shot :/ haha. Cheers b'ys

He was blown away by your stuff and insisted on seeing you live everytime you came to Ottawa. He gave me a lifelong love of music and although he passed away (way too young) in 2013, everytime I listen to New Goodbye or Red Heart or Plan Your Escape I think of better, happy times. Thank you for rekindling his passion for live music - he said no one in his recent memory did live shows like you. He was your biggest fan.

|-| cnv65ca || 4 || what is the hardest part of your job? |-| 
|-| cnv66w0 || 3 || I’m very interested in learning about your songwriting craft. Here are too many insane, rambling questions about it. If you could choose even just a few of these to answer, a fellow songwriter would really appreciate it:

1) Tim: how much of the song do you try to “finish” before you bring it into the band? A full draft you can play on guitar or piano? An A section and a B section? A single chord progression? Any/all of the above?

2) Tim: for songwriters, it’s tricky to know when to put down an piece for a while if you’ve run into a wall. Do you self-impose a limit on how much time you’ll work on a “finishing” a lyric? How do you decide when to push through blocks and when to abandon unfinished verses or dangling lines so your thoughts can marinate?

3) Tim: you’re back in St. John’s after tour and finally have time to sit down and focus on writing some songs. What does your writing routine look like back home? Where do you start lyrically? With lines you’ve collected in your phone/notebooks the years? Skimming journals from the road for nuggets of ideas/lines? Big, vague, undefined themes you want to explore, such as “home” or “doubt”?

4) Hey Rosetta! songs to avoid or play loosely with formulaic ABAB structures. Gold Teeth, for example, changed a lot structurally from when you played it in 2013 to the Second Sight recording; the original chorus became the C section. You’ve said before you guys tear your songs apart and re-suture them in a thousand different ways to find what works. What sorts of questions do you ask of the songs as you’re hammering out arrangements in the practice space? Then, what problems do you look for as you play the prototype versions in a live setting? Finally, how do you all agree when a song is “ready” (as if that is even a thing)?

5) Tim: does the music inform you lyrical themes or vice versa? If you start with chords, a melody, and dummy lyrics, how important is it for you to evoke the feeling of the music through words? 

6) What were your day jobs early on and when did you know the band was successful enough that you could quit them?

7) Tim: for the most part, you tend to put some tiny glimmer of hope or positivity or triumph or hope in even your darker lyrics (save maybe Bricks). In day to day life, are you a positive person or a cynic? Do you put those rays of hope in your lyrics deliberately? 

8) Second Sight is a gorgeous, texturally luscious record. After learning from Marcus Paquin, Tony Doogan, and Hawksley (big fan! he’s how I discovered you guys), is anyone in the band looking to get into production during the Hey Rosetta! off season (not that you seem to have one)?

9) What’s the practice schedule and writing routine look like for the whole band when you’re all back in St. John’s?

I deeply appreciate and am inspired by all the hard work you guys put in to crafting interesting, thoughtful, life-affirming music. It’s hard to love much unabashedly, but you guys make it look easy. Thank you. If you can, please squeeze a Chicago date into your upcoming tour!
 |-| 
|-| cnv67ku || 12 || Tim - I read in a recent interview that you often feel like most of your days as a musician are spent screaming at the audience - and that on this album  you wanted the make sure the words you wrote were worth screaming about.

Do you think you've achieved that?

As an audience member, I tend to notice these little moments, when the song lulls or the tone is somber and a tiny smile begins to creep onto your face. Before you know it, you're full on beaming and singing. What are you thinking about in those moments? What about being on stage makes you happy?

Last question: In Trish's Song, I really noticed the emphasis on the word "receive." It is this beautiful, unexpected part of the song, one word which stretches higher and longer and turns into the peak of the song. It feels like you're trying to collect all of the joy and pain of a life, and crush it into two syllables, but you just can't, so the word stretches longer and longer, higher and higher. It's like the camera is panning from the church choir, up and up until it hits that sparkly piece of sunlight at the top.

What does that word signify to you? 

Thanks! |-| 
|-| cnv69fa || 8 || Hey guys - thanks for doing the AMA!

We are expecting our first and when I first found out I was going to be a dad, I listened to Welcome a few times.  Great song and certainly hit a spot.  Did you know that Grant Lawrence plays it on CBC Radio 3 whenever he hears of someone welcoming a new life?

Anyway, onto my real question (with a bit of back story): Last year I saw Elliott BROOD up here in Whitehorse and I was discussing with Casey afterwords.  I thanked him for trekking all the way up because I don't think anyone makes any money coming up here.  His repsonse was that they really love the crowds up here (they were up for DCMF a few years ago) and compared it to St. John's.  He said the best crowds they've played for have been here and in St. John's.

So my question(s): 

1. Have you guys played up here in the past?  And if so, are the crowds comparable?  (I figured you'd have the inside track on that, y'know?)

2. When are you coming to Whitehorse? |-|

Huge fan since, and I selfishly hope that you guys never stop making music together. My question is about your arranging and mixing. I think just about all of your songs are great on the first listen, but so much nuance and musical cleverness comes out after more careful appreciation that makes your music a pleasure to listen to over and over. I can't think of a good question now, so if you all had to pick different careers, what would they be? |-| 
|-| cnv6c7b || 3 || I really like the sound of Soft Offering (For the Oft Suffering) and it seems to draw a lot of musical influences from different places - can you talk a bit about what went into getting the sound / arrangement for that track? |-| 
|-| cnv6cim || 32 || Hey - me and my wife have tix for Valentines Day in TO.
We both grew up in NFLD and went to MUN 1997-2001.
Anyway, what are your top 3 fav bars on George St (past or present)?
Cheers, and keep up the good work!

|-| cnv6ger || 21 || Hey folks, Stephen here

Long time fan and have turned your annual Christmas show at Mile One into a solidified tradition.

One of the coolest things about you guys is your local interaction here in St. John's. What are your 3 favorite spots in St. John's? |-| 
|-| cnv6h41 || 7 || Hey guys! Have you moved past Plan Your Escape entirely? I would love to hear songs like Another Pilot live. |-| 
|-| cnv6hmy || 7 || Have you ever felt threatened by a client? eg. if you don't get them out of the shit they'll get someone to mess you up? |-|

|-| cnv6ihv || 4 || what do you recommend to a tourist who gets into legal trouble while visiting UK? |-| 
|-| cnv6jnh || 5 || Hey! I've met you all a few times in/around Ottawa (@ Neat cafe in Burnstown twice now!) and I'm looking forward to your show at the NAC coming up. Your music has been important to me through a tough couple years and I appreciate all your hard work and time taken after the shows to hangout. 

 I have two questions.
Desert island- one book, one song, one meal. What would you bring?
AND
which song is most fun to perform?

Special request: Next time you play at neat, can you guys tell everyone to get up and dance? It's been killing me sitting around but I don't know if I could convince everyone else by just doing it myself. 

Thanks! |-| 
|-| cnv6lxg || 9 || Greetings! Saw you guys play for the first time during one of your Canada Day shows on George Street several years ago. I think my favorite show though was when you played at Holy Heart with La Strada. Been listening to those guys ever since.

My question is, do you have any plans for European shows? I live in Norway now and would love to see you guys play again. I know you guys are much more successful now and as a result don't play at home as much, but do you ever miss those little bar shows? So much energy crammed into such a small space.

Cheers!  |-| 
|-| cnv6nxu || 8 || Hi guys, first of all I adore you, I want to thank you for making music that helped me through one of the most difficult times of my life that coincided with Seeds coming out, I'm pretty sure that record did more for me than therapy did.

Few questions...
1) Where do you see the band in 10 years? Do you guys ever see yourselves going the Arcade Fire route and becoming huge and playing stadiums, or are you happy continuing to do what you've been doing (amazingly)?

2) What is your all time favourite venue to play?

3) Will you ever play Epitaph live again? That's my favourite of your songs and I've never seen you do it live!

Love you guys and see you in February &lt;3

Edit - also wanted to say, I'm so happy you and Stars are touring together. I know you did a few years ago (I didn't go to that tour) and thought now that you guys are both bigger I wouldn't get the chance to see you together but here we are. A sidenote that I have heard you compared to The Frames a lot, they are my other favourite band and if somehow you ever played together I would lose my mind. |-| 
|-| cnv6om9 || 18 || Hey guys, this is more or less a non serious question for Josh. You seemed to have a difficult time debating whether Shania Twain qualifies as a "jam, or not a jam" during your tenure with CBC Music a few months ago. Henceforth, my entire hometown of Timmins was thoroughly upset and appalled (not really though). Is Shania Twain just difficult to listen to in general or is it just "Man, I feel like a woman"? Good call on the Bob Seger though, I'll give you that. |-| 
|-| cnv6p7e || 4 || Gday.
Lots of great discussion going on here. I have for you guys two questions:

1)How do you feel about the idea of being a "mainstream band". I love your guy's music and think that the more people who know about you the better (you're definitely becoming more popular as it is), but would you prefer to go completely viral and sweep the nation or keep the indie tone? Hope that I'm clear, not sure how to word perfectly. *EDIT* I mean it may depend on your audience I suppose, just wondering what your thoughts are.

2)I unfortunately won't be able to see your performance in Charlottetown  (My digz) on Jan 31 due to other commitments, but is there any chance you'll be hitting up a bar later that evening? If so, I'll be there! 

Keep up the fantastic music! |-| 
|-| cnv6qs5 || 21 || What are your favorite bands from St. John's right now and why? 

Loved your shows at the Delta Ballroom back in the day! So much fun. Thanks for reppin' Newfoundland!  |-| 
|-| cnv6rvm || 3 || Hi Tim, Josh and Phil!
Really excited for the Fredericton show at the Playhouse- always wanted to see you guys at this venue after being a huge fan for years now! I saw you guys here on Canada Day and always remembered Tim saying "There's An Arc" reminded him of Fredericton. Any particular reason? Thanks! |-| 
|-| cnv6too || 4 || If the person you are defending says something that would incriminate themselves, how is that handled? |-| 
|-| cnv6twa || 5 || Salut! Tim, I've always really admired your lyrics - they run the gamut from evocative, symbolism-heavy prose to very down-to-earth and intimate/revealing - how would you describe your approach to lyric writing, and deciding how much to 'let us in' to your personal world? 

Sincere thanks for doing this AMA and can't wait to see you again soon with Stars in Montréal! |-| 
|-| cnv6wo4 || 5 || Remember that $2000 you owe me? :) |-| 
|-| cnv6xb0 || 13 || Does Canada really have milk in bags? |-| 
|-| cnv6yow || 8 || 1) I've noticed that a lot of you seem to have uniforms when you perform. Tim wears a blue button up, Phil wears a deep-v, Kinley wears a pretty dress... Is this on purpose? I've seen you like 7 times and it has been without fail!

2) "Harriet" is my favourite and is a welcome return to your earlier sounds with the heavier piano (i'm no musicologist, is there a proper term for it?) that was featured in your earlier work. Did anything in particular inspire it?

3) Has being in the proverbial spotlight gotten any easier? I've noticed that Tim, in particular, seems to have gotten a less shy over the past few years.

4) How can I get invited to one of those house parties you have thrown in a handful of videos?

5) If you could only be remembered for one of your songs, which one would you want it to be?

6) How do you define success? At what point will you consider HR! to have made it?

Thanks for your time, and for continually changing my life with your music! |-|

I just want to say that I'm a huge fan of your music. I've lost count of how many of your shows I've been to and how many cities I've seen you play in, and I still get, really, really, really excited when you play "Epitaph".

**My question:** Have you ever thought of recording a cover album? Your cover of [Graceland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMxNCRAILk4) was fantastic.

|-| cnv8s7j || 3 || Hey guys,

I have a question in regards to your music knowledge. I'm super into theory myself and I've noticed a progression that your music has gone through from one record to the next. In your earlier stuff, you had some material that seemed to stem from a classical, and even at times Baroque, sound and it was pretty hip. You recent stuff doesn't seem to do this as much, but your instrumentation can still support that sound. 

1. What is your musical background as far as training/studying goes? Do you think about theory when you write/arrange?

2. Will you ever go back to that sound? I notice a lot of bands bridging the gap between older and newer sounds (as far as classical/jazz/contemporary goes) and I'm wondering if you will ever bring some of that stuff back (I think the term is commonly referred to as "Baroque Pop"). And do you care to comment on the trend of music listeners and how open they are to hearing that sound incorporated into contemporary styles? |-| 
|-| cnv8wi6 || 3 || Hey guys! I was at Hillside music festival over the summer and saw your workshop but was extremely bummed out when the festival got shit down because of the storm. I am extremely excited to see you guys at Hillside Inside though!

My question is, who would you guys most like to play with in the future? |-| 
|-| cnv8yvx || 6 || Was the 3 Stooges episode "Disorder in the Court" a huge influence on your law defending career ? |-| 
|-| cnv8zp7 || 4 || Hey guys! big fan here and fellow Newfie! I've seen you guys 4 times now, Salmon fest, The Delta Ball Room, and the last 2 christmas shows, always enjoy every performance. I'm from Placentia (an hour from St.Johns) and my question is have you guys heard of it or been? I always heard a rumor that Tim had family out here or something. Happy redditing :) |-| 
|-| cnv8zqj || 3 || Do you consider yourself wealthy? |-| 
|-| cnv901x || 3 || Hey you guys! I remember the first time I saw you was at the Halifax Pavilion. I was in high school in a band of my own at the time. I'm curious, before you found your Hey Rosetta sound, did you guys play in other groups? Other genres? Any high school band stories?

Also, Evolve - you guys are a staple at that fest, i always love seeing you on and off the stage. I'm wondering if you have any insight into how it's changing, growing, if you think it's for better or worse, etc. Evolve is home for me, I guess i'd just like to hear your take on it all. 

Much love! |-| 
|-| cnv95bx || 3 || UK Marijuana &amp; search laws:

If you are pulled over in the UK and the cop says he smells marijuana, is that cause to search? Do they need a warrant?

If you are searched and they find a gram of weed, then what?

How bout an ounce?

How bout a pound?

Say no Marijuana was found in the search, but there was $50,000 cash - is Civil Forfeiture a thing in the UK?

Same scinerio as above, what if they found 0.01 of a gram of weed, 50k, then what?  |-|

|-| cnv9a8z || 3 || Hey guys!

I was fifteen in PEI when I walked in to make my important first purchase at a music shop. I admittedly was musically malnourished so I only had the cover art of CDs to go by. I'm so happy I picked up Plan Your Escape as it had a huge affect on me through highschool. You guys were there through my breakups, first times, and last times. Thanks for that!

Will you be gracing us with your presence at Evolve this year?  We love your shows and are planning to get back to the maritimes for the festival and are hoping you will be there.
 |-| 
|-| cnv9cs5 || 3 || OOOOoooo a corruption expert!  Fascinating!

Could you possibly talk about the corruption you are seeing in the United States?

Ive always told people that the corruption in the US only happens at the highest levels.  Try to walkin to a DMV and buying a license from someone working there will get you arrested.  If you need the EPA's rules loosened so your company can pollute more and make more money, donate millions to the right campaign coffers...

In the US, only the rich are allowed to be corrupt. |-| 
|-| cnv9jyv || 3 || Say I invest in a product, how long will I get returns for? Is there anyway to verify these companies profits so lets say they make $1000 but the company says they only made $500 who can confirm this and how can I trust them? |-|

|-| cnv9omo || 3 || How are court proceedings different in the UK?

In the US, you're innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  

Do you have anything similar to the Miranda Rights?  http://tftppull.freethoughtllc.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/miranda-warning.jpg   |-| 
|-| cnva7dv || 3 || 1) About a hundred years ago (2008?) when Tribeca was still open in Halifax you folks played an amazing RSVP/invitation only set at the Sonic Temple. I seem to recall it was for a video recording? What ever happened to that footage!?

That evening I was gobsmacked (had a big ol' collective crush on the band) and shyly stuck around to help pack up chairs. I ended up having a discussion with Adam about how I'd lost my original version of Plan Your Escape and was miffed because the re-release had different album art. He offered to mail me a copy if I forwarded my address from the house in Saint John's. 

Which I did. After which true to his word he sent me a copy. I was elated.

|-| cnvfmb2 || 6 || There are a lot of shows that seem to have increased the popularity of antiques and vintage items (american pickers, flea market flip, antiques road show).  Mainly because they glamorize the industry that there are treasures everywhere and it can be easy to find.  But what they don't seem to showcase is the knowledge that people have.  Certain styles of furniture, makers of particular dishes or clocks.

|-| cnvgzxy || 3 || Rugged Man! Dude, so glad I saw this AMA announced on twitter. Also love the Cosby-bathroom thing. Anyway, a couple questions:

1) Is there any interview footage of you as Crustified Dibbs? Love your YouTube shit, but the Crustified persona really intrigues me. Was wondering if you could explain a little bit about that and the whole speech/retarded thing. Also, if there are any old interviews from back then, I'd love to see them.

2) You absolutely destroy it on tracks like 3 Kingz, Renaissance, Uncommon Valor, etc., etc. On other songs, you seem to go a little slower and less focused on ridiculous rhymes. Not "softer," but just not as crazy. Is there any particular reason for this as opposed to putting out records where you just deliver non-stop in-your-face rhymes?

3) Did you ever get a chance to work with guys like Big L or Big Pun? The Biggie stories are great. 

Edit: and Sam Peckinpah might just be one of the greatest videos/songs I've ever heard. You and Paz are always great. |-| 
|-| cnvh0oi || 12 || If you could pick any producer, dead or alive, who would you like to have a collaboration project with? I'd kill for a Statik Selektah/R.A. The Rugged man album. Also, not sure if you remember, but you came and did a set in a shitty dive bar in my city awhile ago and when you started doing your verse from Uncommon Valor I started rappin it with you pretty loud and you had to stop and tell me to shut the fuck up. That might have been one of the greatest moments in my life so thanks for that.   |-|

Can you clarify what (if anything) really happened? I've heard a dozen versions of it and also heard it was just a rumor. Either way, you really prolly are. So there's that.

1) Who is the hardest striker you have ever faced?
2) What does your body feel like the day after a grueling fight?  I imagine it is a whole other level of soreness.
3) Were you always a "badass" growing up?  I read that quite a few of MMA's top guys were not the billy badasses when younger but obviously through training and hard work became some of the top skilled fighters in the world.
 |-| 
|-| cnx9dx6 || 38 || Would you be offended if a non Hawiaan born person got tatoos similar to yours?

And I doubt you'll want to answer this, but how do you feel about the NYT refusing to show the very Charlie Hebdo illustrations which have dominated the discourse as of recently? How do you feel about spreading the risk, wherein if every media outlet published the cartoons in question then it would be impossible for Jihadists to single one out? |-|

|-| cnx9xnw || 4 || Hello there!

I'm a fellow illustrator... or trying to be one at least post-art-school-blues, and was wondering if at the beginning of your career did you nosedive right into being an illustrator or did you have a job to make money on the side as well? This is the problem I'm having with really committing to be an illustrator in a city that demands so much to be paid to it!

Many thanks, your work is brilliant! |-|

Also - Did you think Schaub wanted out of that fight once he stepped in the cage? |-| 
|-| cnxaprw || 11 || Just out of personal opinion this feels like a weaker lineup then last year. Maybe it's just preference. However, I'm interested in whether there were any major upsets that lead to this lineup. Maybe act you almost booked but fell through last minute? I've been to the ball every year but sadly this was the first lineup that just didn't do it for me. So I guess I'm just curious if you agree, and if so why that was?  |-| 
|-| cnxau7x || 3 || Favorite artist other than yourself? |-| 
|-| cnxausv || 3 || Did you guys ever have a 'OH S%^!' moment during the festival that almost happened, but didn't? |-| 
|-| cnxawax || 5 || Hey guys thanks for doing this! 

So Governors Ball bills itself as purely a music festival (whereas Coachella and Bonnaroo bill themselves as a "Music and Arts Festival"). Do you ever think one day you'll make that jump? 

NYC has the greatest stand up comedy scene in the world. It's a shame to not take advantage of that.

I know you can't have permanent installations on Randall's Island. But having something artistic and imaginative on site like the Coachella snail or a Sonic Forrest would be pretty darn awesome too.

Thanks for putting together the highlight of summer. |-| 
|-| cnxawbg || 3 || Were there any artists that you tried to recruit for Gov Ball this year but couldn't quite land (similar to Eminem last year)? |-| 
|-| cnxayfp || 16 || Any chance we get more beer options? I don't like the fruity stuff (summer shandy, redds) and Miller doesn't cut it for me. This festival represents New York City, and with all the great breweries nearby you guys could do a whole lot better. Even if it's just Brooklyn Brewery or the new Gun Hill Brewery, I'll be stoked. |-|

|-| cnxb4v0 || 9 || Are there any plans for stepping up the after show game? Last year was definitely a step in the right direction - but looking towards what fests like Lolla do with the restrictions of being in a city - and given that NYC has an abundance of venues and late night audience - I think it could really blow up |-|

As someone who also draws (A LOT) for a living, I'm interested in hearing about how you deal with carpal tunnel...if you get it too every once in a while? Do you have any sort of regimen or tips? I'm all ears.

Thanks so much! |-|

|-| cnxbi1j || -4 || Last year's festival was one of the best I've ever attended. Amazing lineup and the weather couldn't have been better. I for one, was looking forward to seeing how you guys would top it this year. Honestly, I had doubts that it would be possible to procure a better lineup this year. I bought a presale ticket, and eagerly waited for this years line-up to be announced.  This years lineup definitely did not top last year, and is possibly one of the worst north american lineups of 2015. My question is, did you spend too much money on talent last year making this year worse? Did you lose members of your team to other festivals? Did you burn too many brain cells last year? Enlighten us, please.  |-| 
|-| cnxbob7 || 4 || Noel Gallagher, my favorite musician of all time, is skipping NYC on his headlining US tour. I'm praying this means he's getting that 90 minute closing spot on the Honda stage, like Damon Albarn got last year! Have you figured out his spot yet? |-| 
|-| cnxboqf || 4 || When will the day by day line-up be released along with single day tickets? |-| 
|-| cnxbpie || 3 || Did you guys try to get Parquet Courts in the lineup? I know you guys like having local bands play and thought there was a shot they would show up this year. |-| 
|-| cnxbtqb || 4 || This is my first Governor's Ball and I splurged on VIP. Problem is, none of my friends wanted to spend the money so I'm going solo. Am I going to fare alright on my own?  |-| 
|-| cnxbvlq || 11 || Hey Pals!

I survived the storm and mud of 2013, I survived the heat of 2014 at Gov Ball and had a blast! I've yet to get tickets for this year. I had an absolute ball watching Young the Giant in the rain and mud it was the best. 2014 Childish Gambino and Damion Marley killed it. 

In 15 words or less sell me on this years Gov Ball. 

Ps. Kanye was the shittttt 
PPs.. free tickets for a Gov Ball veteran? :) |-|

|-| cnxc4iu || 23 || Hi, Colin,

How likely are we to see the following any time soon:

1.) Another (less expensive) release of *The Unfortunate Demise of Whitley Rackham*? An ebook perhaps?

2.) A new live DVD

3.) Another live solo album (I NEED a quality acoustic version of "Lake Song" and "Why Would I" in my life!) |-| 
|-| cnxc4z4 || 29 || Hi Colin!
 
Who is next up on “Colin Meloy Sings…?”
 
Do the novel writing and the song writing process differ much? How so?
 
I have never connected to a band like I have yours and I’ve found myself on some pretty crazy adventures and met some delightful people whilst traveling to see your shows. So thank you for all you do. 

Love the new record! |-| 
|-| cnxc5d9 || 8 || Colin,

Thank you for doing this AMA! I am such a huge fan of yours that I really can’t figure out how to tell you how much I appreciate your music and writing. It has been so fun to see you and the band progress and shift as musicians and entertainers. You all have brought such joy to me from listening to your music that I will always be truly, truly grateful.  Thank you.

How do you approach songwriting? Does the story and lyrics come first or does the melody or does it all just kind of swim around in your head? Does being a father change the way you approach the creative process?

Also, is there any news about your stage musical project?

Also, I just want to say that the new album What A Terrible World, What A Wonderful World is fantastic! Hope to see you in Texas on the tour!
 |-| 
|-| cnxc7cc || 4 || Hi Colin! Thank you so much for doing this AMA.

I’m doing a live radio show right NOW! Which Decemberists song should I play? |-| 
|-| cnxc7vb || 4 || 1. whats the hardest part putting together a music festival in NYC? 
2. hows 2016 looking?
3. i noticed quite a bit of people sneaking into the VIP area last year as well, takes away from paying what we had paid for it, is there something to fix that this year?  |-| 
|-| cnxc7xo || 3 || Colin, my wife and I have been reading the Wildwood books to our kids and they were asking, are there any talks of making the books into movies? We so enjoy them! Thanks a bunch! |-| 
|-| cnxc87j || 3 || I don't think my experience is what you're looking for but I'm bored. 

1. I worked for the county parks department and they staff a small 6 run hill. 

2. No, we learned on the spot and only had a limited menu so it wasn't an issue. There were some employees that worked the kitchen everyday so I only learned enough to cover for breaks. 

3. I also worked in the rental shop and I loved setting up little kids boards because they were always so excited. If people were nice, they got newer gear. Disrespectful jerks got whatever I was easiest to grab, usually a bit older and worn. 

4. The kitchen would occasionally float me food, I got free soda. The ticket booth guy would hook me up with passes on my off days if I waited until there wasn't anybody around. Employees used to get free passes but budget cuts ruined that. I also got my state's snowmobile license for free because we were technically public land. 

5. It was usually just me. 

Like I said, this was a small hill so I ran all the lifts, tube Hill tow, rental shop, kitchen, cleaning, snow machines, everything except the groomer.  |-| 
|-| cnxc8fz || 84 || I hope this Thursday is finding you well! I had two questions. First, the Crane Wife song cycle is one of my favorites…I was just wondering what was behind the decision to start the album with Crane Wife 3 and then come back to 1 and 2 later on the album?

And second, are there any old songs that you’re finding live versions have now breathed new life into them and you’re excited to play them again out on the road on the upcoming tour?

I’ve greatly enjoyed the Decemberists’ albums and live shows, as well as the Wildwood series, so thank you for all of that! It is all much appreciated.
 |-| 
|-| cnxc8ki || 6 || Hi Colin! 
I am a huge fan! I have probably been to every Decemberists show in Los Angeles for the past eight years (including the time you pulled audience members onto the stage to sing chorus at the Wiltern Theater and I looked on wistfully from the sick person section with my sick person girlfriend). Your music is a constant inspiration to me. Thank you for the better part of a decade of great times.  My questions are: 


1. Has your opinion of Los Angeles Changed since "Los Angeles, I'm Yours" ? 


2. What is the very best name for a pirate?  |-| 
|-| cnxc8tg || 71 || What does Stephen Colbert smell like? |-| 
|-| cnxcaaf || 5 || Have you ever considered selling cider at Govball to accommodate people like myself who have celiacs? |-| 
|-| cnxcaxu || 102 || Hi Colin, thanks for doing this AMA. My husband and I are big fans and make it to every show that you guys do in the SF Bay Area. You did a show at the Fox Theatre in oakland, CA on 2/14/2011 that definitely stands out as our favorite. That was the night that my husband proposed to me and you invited the two of us up on the stage for a wedding ceremony performed by John. I just wanted to thank you and the band for making our proposal so memorable, and also for pretty much guaranteeing that our proposal story is better than everyone else's. I do regret that we didn't hang around after the show to meet you guys, but we had the pressing issue of our car being locked in the parking garage to deal with.  

We'll see you guys at your show in Berkeley in May. Oh, I guess I was supposed to ask questions? Can you squeeze Yankee Bayonet into the setlist for Berkeley? And can we buy you guys a round of drinks or something after the show? We feel like we owe you one. 

[Up on the stage!](http://i.imgur.com/XU0Ypot.jpg)

[Yay!](http://i.imgur.com/T2mQ0Vx.jpg)

[Married!](http://i.imgur.com/k3GP5vc.jpg) |-| 
|-| cnxcc21 || 82 || Hello Colin, 

I'm wondering what you cite as your literary influences? You strike me as a well read man. I know you've read infinite jest, have any other books had a significant impact on your writing or style? |-| 
|-| cnxcc3a || 3 || Hi Colin, how often do you have to resist the urge to hug Chris Funk?    
     
Also, I love the new record &amp; would like to know which song you're most excited to start playing live? See you in Boston! |-| 
|-| cnxcch0 || 11 || Do you think you'll ever do anything like The Tain again? 

Also what is your favourite board / card game? 

What a terrible tour, what a beautiful tour. I hope you guys announce more east coast dates soon. DC is dying to have you back. 


Now that I got to sit down at my computer I just want to say thank you for your music and inspiration. The Decemberists is my absolute favourite band without a shadow of a doubt. You had to change some, but I'll always love you guys and be absolutely envious of Colin's talented writing. Do you guys plan on doing any fan meets after concerts or do you plan on doing book signings in the future? My life would be forever enriched if I could shake your hand.  |-| 
|-| cnxccqq || 21 || I just want to sincerely thank you (and the entire band) for making incredible music that has been like a warm, fuzzy, comforting security blanket for me since I started listening almost 10 years ago. So, thank you, enthusiastically!

I have a weird burning need to know if you have ever met John Darnielle? I just need to know if there has ever been any interaction between my two favorite musicians. 
 |-| 
|-| cnxcdgc || 4 || Awesome lineup you guys have this year! Our band is from NYC and we'd love to have a shot at performing at the festival one day. Are there any opportunities for undiscovered and upcoming bands to audition or submit to play at the festival?  |-| 
|-| cnxcdvq || 48 || Hey Colin! 

Recently my friend and I have been discussing the connection between Summersong and Anti-summersong and I'm so excited to get the chance to ask you about this myself! Summersong has been (and continues to be) one of my favorite Decemberists songs because of the breathtaking imagery, awesome alliteration, and themes particularly relevant to my life. So I'm wondering what inspired you to write a song that - as the title implies - is the opposite of Summersong? Is it meant to negate the message of the original song, provide another point of view, or something else?

Thank you so much for doing this; it means a lot to your fans! I can't wait to see you and the band when you roll through Atlanta in April! |-| 
|-| cnxce7s || 7 || Hi Colin!!

I am an enormously big fan of everything you and the whole gang have produced. Your work is a behind a lot of the passion I still have for music. The promotion of this new album has been especially fun to watch, and I love how much fun you guys are having getting back out there after the long hiatus. One of my favorite things about this album's promotion has been the creation and giveaway of two beautiful quilts that look like the new album cover. 

Sam Hunter, a well-known member of the professional quilting community, just posted this [Open Letter](http://huntersdesignstudio.com/2015/01/22/an-open-letter-to-the-decemberists-quilts-and-their-makers-have-value/) to you and the band about these quilts. 

* What are your thoughts on her request to name the artist behind the quilts? 

* Why is the estimated value ($388/quilt) so low when it's common knowledge that they are incredibly labor intensive and require a huge amount of skill? 

Edit to add one more bonus question: Is there ever a chance you stick around after shows to say a few hellos? I've been to several and always hoped I'd catch you or anyone from the band and have never had any luck. 

*Another edit to tweak formatting |-| 
|-| cnxce8o || 5 || I have my prom Friday night, please tell me that drake is not that day.
What day is he? |-| 
|-| cnxceo0 || 8 || Colin, what inspired you to write "June Hymn?" it's my favorite song in the entire world and I want the background story! |-| 
|-| cnxcf16 || 208 || Where did the inspiration for The Mariner's Revenge Song come from? It's so sweeping, epic, twisted, and wonderful, that when my friend first had me listen to it back in 2005, I was hooked.

Do you remember climbing a balcony, singing Culling of the Fold, days after President Obama's election in 2008, at the Electric Factory in Philadelphia? What possessed you to do that?
Because it was great. |-| 
|-| cnxcf5g || 6 || Hi, Colin! Several questions for you:

1. If you could cover absolutely any song in the world that you haven't yet covered, what would it be, and why?
2. What is your novel-writing process like? Was there anything you wanted to include in the Wildwood Chronicles that you regrettably had to cut while editing?
3. In the same vein, what is your song-writing process like? Do you decide on the story you want the song to tell first, or the tune, or something else entirely? |-| 
|-| cnxcf89 || 17 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| cnxcfj2 || 4 || I've been occasionally pestering you guys for concert videos since the 2013 festival. I saw the 2014 recap video, and it was great, but what the fans want is to see more videos from some of the bigger acts the past few years (Kanye, The Strokes, Kendrick, etc). It's sad that the only thing on your YouTube is "Ho Hey" by The Lumineers. It would help you guys draw bigger interest to the festival, and it gives fans like me a memory of the festival to look back on and get pumped for the next year. why have you not done this? |-| 
|-| cnxcflc || 8 || Hi Colin,

Do you feel like "Hazards of Love" got all of the prog out of the band's system? 

(preferred answer is "No.")

(more preferred answer is "We're actually recording an album-length cover of 'Foxtrot.'") |-| 
|-| cnxcfrm || 5 || Hi Colin! 

A friend of mine, despite his claims of being the most Portland of anyone he knows, failed to celebrate Decemberists Day despite being given advance notice. 

How best should he be punished, in your opinion? I've already threatened to revoke his beard privileges to no effect...

 |-| 
|-| cnxcgnd || 43 || Do you ever plan to do another Hazards of Love type album? |-| 
|-| cnxcgup || 24 || Hey! Two questions, feel free to answer one, or both would be nice. :-)

1) What is your favorite book/what are you reading now?

2) What's on your guitar's pedalboard?

Really appreciate you taking the time out to do this. Love the new album!  |-| 
|-| cnxcgxl || 3 || What expectations, if any, do you have from the crowd at your shows?  Do you like to see enthusiasm, singing along to all the words, etc.?  Does it annoy you to see people standing there with their arms crossed?

P.S. Please come back to Winnipeg soon! |-| 
|-| cnxcgxx || 7 || Hi Colin!

What are the chances of ever getting a live theatrical stage version of "The Hazards of Love"? It's far and away my favorite Decemberists record and I gotta admit, I've spent quite a bit of time daydreaming about sets, costumes, staging, etc. 

If this isn't something y'all would ever want to do, is there a chance that an aspiring director like myself might be able to procure the appropriate rights to make one happen on a local level?

ETA: Thanks for your work - you're majorly inspiring to me, as a logophile. I used to work in a Shakespeare theater and it's always struck me how your lyrics are similar (albeit quite different) in a level-of-complexity kind of way. |-| 
|-| cnxch0q || 14 || What was it like to be on Parks and Rec? |-| 
|-| cnxch1c || 5 || Hi, is this the Keith Urban AMA? |-| 
|-| cnxch8l || 3 || Hello Colin,

What kind of guitar are you playing on A Beginning Song, and where can I get one?

Thanks,

Colin |-| 
|-| cnxch9r || 64 || 1. The Bandit Queen cut off of the bonus record from Picareque has a quaint little skit before it.  Did you guys script that or just wing it?

2. Would you consider playing some Tarkio material on your tour for the new album?  That would be awesome.

3. Ever think about doing story-based a film of The Hazards of Love, like the one Andy Smetanka did for The Tain? |-| 
|-| cnxchby || 4 || Hi Colin!

First and foremost, I am a huge fan.  Decemberists is my favorite band and you are my favorite songwriter.


Where in the writing process does the rest of the band come in?  When you bring a song to the band, do you already have in mind how you want the music to go and dictate it to Chris, Nate, Jenny, and John, or do they pretty much write for their own instruments?

Thanks! |-| 
|-| cnxci89 || 7 || I was incredibly worried when I read you guys were writing a song on the tragedy that happened in Newtown, CT just over two years ago, but "12/17/12" turned out an absolutely beautiful song and a highlight of the record. What convinced you to tackle such a difficult subject and how difficult was the writing process considering the suject matter? |-| 
|-| cnxcijj || 11 || Hi Colin!  I've been a fan of The Decemberists for years, you guys have been inspiring me since I was a teenager.  I love learning about history and obviously you write and sing about historical subjects and time periods pretty frequently, so my question is this: **If you had to pick another time period to live in besides this one, which would it be?**

Thanks so much for doing this AmA and for all your amazing music, I honestly doubt I would be the same person I am today if I had never heard of The Decemberists.

Edit: also you should totally have a concert in South Carolina someday!  We're nice people, I promise! |-| 
|-| cnxcirf || 7 || Hi Colin!

First off, I just want to say I’m such a huge fan of yours and of your wife. I have been listening to The Decemberists and Tarkio for such a long time, The Decemberists have been my ultimate, number one, favorite band in the universe since 2003, which is when I first heard “Red Right Ankle”. Your wife, Carson Ellis, was a huge influence on me as well, and seeing her art drove me to pursue Illustration, which I’m getting my degree in now.  Seeing her art work on all of your album covers, I fell in love with the literal marriage of your music and her art, and I knew I wouldn’t be satisfied unless I strove to do the same in my life. I am ashamed to say that it has taken me this long, but I started reading Wildwood 2 days ago, and I’m 50 or so pages from the end now, and it’s as wonderful as I ever expected. You both make such beautiful things, and I have to thank you for putting them into the world. They have affected my life so significantly, and I can’t imagine I’m the only one. 

So my questions are:

1. If you could open up a strange portal to the scenes you paint into your lyrics, which one would you most want to travel to?

2. Do you have any thoughts of further exploring the Wildwood world? Music, movies, more books?

3. Why do you hate Baltimore/DC, and why are you punishing us by skipping us on the tour and making us go to Philadelphia where the only seats left are “obstructed by pillars”?  |-| 
|-| cnxcivu || 25 || Hi Colin! Bought the new album yesterday! Love it!

Will there be an EP similar to "Long Live the King" for this album? 

Thanks! |-| 
|-| cnxcj00 || 3 || Thanks for doing this AMA! The new album is amazing (and my vinyl from Newbury Comics is gorgeous). There are a couple lines that have stood out to me each time I've listened to it.

Do you have a favorite lyric or two from the album?  |-| 
|-| cnxcj73 || 3 || Hello Colin,
My family and I are raving fans of the Wildwood series. Thank you for the adventures.  Do you have any plans to write novels outside the young adult genre? |-| 
|-| cnxcjng || 8 || Hi Colin,

You have been my favorite lyricist and musician for many years now. The term "blue raincoats" has really stuck with me. What was your inspiration behind that? Thanks! |-| 
|-| cnxckp3 || 39 || Hey Colin, thanks for doing the AMA! Can't tell you how many times I've listened to the new album at this point.

My question is: You've mentioned that *We Both Go Down Together* is more or less a prequel to *Leslie Anne Levine*. Have you ever considered that the mothers in *A Cautionary Song* and *Mariner's Revenge* are one and the same as well? It always seemed to me that the link could exist! And further, with *Anti-Summersong*, do you see yourself writing more interconnected songs in the future? |-| 
|-| cnxcku5 || 232 || Hi Mr. Meloy, 

I want to start by sincerely thanking for doing this AMA. The Decemberists have been my favorite band for about 9 years now, and I really appreciate this opportunity to ask you a question. I would also like to add that I've seen you guys in concert at least 5 times, and you, hands down, give the best performance out of any band I've seen. 

My question is this: **What happened to the baby in *Hazards of Love*?** Sorry if this isn't the most exciting question, but my husband and I have spent literally hours debating and theorizing this, or if it was even ever born, and simply must know. We even have this fan theory about infinitely repeating fates. 

PS- I've really been enjoying the new album. My pre-order arrived a few days early, and I've had it playing in my car since. Thank you again! |-| 
|-| cnxckv9 || 15 || Hi Colin!

Hazards of Love is one of the most touching, inspirational tragic love stories I've ever heard.  I have two questions regarding it

1.  I developed a theory that the two lovers die with their baby, and the Queen discovers the baby and raises it, much as she does with William.  Am I full of malarky, or is this a possibility.
2.  Is there any chance that you would do a reunion tour for this album, even if in the far-off future?  I caught it at Lollapalooza in 2009, but wasn't familiar with the album and thus wasn't able to fully enjoy it, as I would now (aka singing along and crying profusely).  

Thank you!  Can't wait to hear the new album!  Trying to talk my husband into spending our Gas and Electric money on the boxed edition :) |-| 
|-| cnxckxk || 3 || Hello Colin! 
I've seen you play at Sasquatch multiple times over the years and I feel like no other band I've seen has compared to the amazing presence you all have on stage.  Your music has been able to lift me up when I've needed it so I wanted to start by saying thank you! 
My sister and I were super bummed to see no Washington tour dates! Are there other tour dates being announced later? Will they include Washington?  (Pretty please!) |-| 
|-| cnxcl71 || 3 || Hi Colin,

What are your thoughts on albums being divisible into individual songs versus being viewed as one continuous work? I ask because I've seen The Decemberists live playing a whole album as a set *(The Hazards of Love)*, and also picking and choosing songs across the discography. 
 
Do you approach albums with a continuous theme in mind from the beginning, or do you find that while something may develop over time you "let them fall where they may," artistically?  What's the hardest thing about continuing to create music after all these years? |-| 
|-| cnxcm4l || 38 || Hi Colin! 

1. Culling of the Fold is one of my favorite songs of yours. I love it's manic energy. Do you have any insight into the creation of it? It seems like many don't know about it since it was a bonus/exclusive track. Any chance we'll ever hear it live again? 

2. You're an incredible writer and I loved the Wildwood books. Have you ever considered writing an adult novel? 

Thanks!  |-| 
|-| cnxcmh2 || 5 || What would you say is a bigger influence on your music, infanticide, rape, or nautical adventure? |-| 
|-| cnxcmxk || 4 || Colin, the Decemberists are my favorite band to see live (not too shabby on record too) because of how funny you guys are together and the great on stage chemistry you have with each other.  
  
What are some of your favorite on stage memories where something funny or out of the ordinary happened?  For example, when your guitar broke at Sasquatch 2011 and Chris had to fill in by scatting and singing The Outfield songs. |-| 
|-| cnxcmzt || 3 || Howdy Mr Meloy, I'm Benjamin and I'm so glad that you are doing this. Feel free to send me a private message so we can become best friends.
 Now, I'll ask you a question. 
I dont want to ask anything too broad, but nothing too specific (like what brand of toothpaste you use or something.) I'm actually in science class right now (grade ten CST so it's not that hard.) and I'm listening to Crane Wife. I've noticed in Crane Wife 1, when it's all quiet at the beginning, theres a sound in the background that sounds like an oxygen breather machine. It sounds like somebody taking deep breaths. I was just wondering what that sound was? Oh, and what brand of toothpaste you use? Great talking to you! 
 Lots of love, Benjamin. |-| 
|-| cnxcnbe || 3 || Hi Colin, huge fan, will see you in Bristol in February.
Do you think you'll ever tour the full Hazards of Love album again? |-| 
|-| cnxcnmf || 3 || Colin -

Thanks for doing this. Long time music-lover, blogger, promoter - and much of it is thanks to you and your music.

A lot of folks view The Decemberists (along with Radiohead, Sufjan, The National, etc.) as one of the progenitors of modern indie music.

How do you feel about the music "scene" today? Do you feel it's more welcoming/supportive of unique artists and experimentation than it was when you first started writing music? 


Who are some of your favorite bands today? Is it surreal, in any way, to realize there is a stronge chance your music may have influenced one or more of these bands?


As non-traditional shows and venues continue to get a head of steam (house shows, secret shows, etc.) do you, either solo or with The Decemberists, envision yourself ever doing a unique tour taking advantage of that movement?


Thanks so much for taking the time to do this! |-| 
|-| cnxcnq8 || 3 || Hi Colin! A friend and I have long been wondering, what does the word "long" mean to you? It seems to comes up in a lot of nontraditional senses in your lyrics. 

Another question: are there any songs (or artists) that you listen to and feel in awe of the genius of it all?  |-| 
|-| cnxcp0y || 3 || Did the Mariner ever make it out of that whale? |-| 
|-| cnxcpnd || 3 || Colin! Buddy. HUGE fan, I'm digging the edgier and more electric sound on your new single. 

My question is: Have you ever considered collaborating with Ben Gibbard? Even for just one song? I firmly believe deep down in my soul that, with your powers combined, you two could write The World's Most Beautiful Story Song and then I could truly die happy. 

Saw you at U.C.C.S in 2011, and on behalf of Colorado Springs I would like to apologize for Gallogly Hall being half empty. It was really an amazing show.  |-| 
|-| cnxcqon || 42 || Colin! The Decemberists are my absolute favorite band, so it's incredibly exciting that you're doing this AMA.

1) Fan question: *Hazards of Love* is still my favorite Decemberists album, and a lot of that has to do with the contributions from Shara Worden. Do you ever plan to collaborate with her or Becky Stark again? When I saw you guys at Merriweather Pavilion for that tour, one of my favorite parts of the show was when Shara and Becky came back out in white jumpsuits and did "Crazy on You" by Heart. 

2) Craft question: You are hands-down the best lyricist I know of. In my own song-writing, one of the big things I struggle with is including concrete, specific details in my lyrics - something you are brilliant at. What tips do you have for including more visual imagery in my lyric writing? I always start with music first, btw, so I'm wondering if your approach differs.

Thank you for doing this AMA and for continuing to produce amazing music. See you at your show in Philly in April! |-| 
|-| cnxcqq3 || 4 || Hi Colin!

Thanks for doing this AmA! I'm a huge fan of your music and I love "What A Terrible World, What A Beautiful World" so far. I remember in an interview you alluded to playing D&amp;D recently--what kind of character did you play? A cavalry captain? A druid who shapeshifted into a fawn? I have to know!

Thanks! |-| 
|-| cnxcrg6 || 3 || Hi Colin,

What is your favourite video game? |-| 
|-| cnxcrze || 5 || Hi Colin, what's your son's favorite bed-time song? |-| 
|-| cnxcts4 || 3 || I was skeptical about the new album and I downloaded it illegally. I was wrong and I love it. To show my appreciation I'm going to buy it on vinyl, but to alleviate my guilt I'd like to donate $50 to a charity of your choice. Which charity should I donate to?  |-| 
|-| cnxcu1e || 7 || Hi Colin, how is Jenny doing? |-| 
|-| cnxcufi || 5 || Hi Colin,
What do you want people to know about autism? |-| 
|-| cnxcuok || 4 || Do you ever plan on doing a Hazards of Love tour or show again? That concert is seriously the best live show I have ever seen.  

If this happens please come to Philly. |-| 
|-| cnxcv5e || 6 || Colin! You're my favorite singer/songwriter in the world, and I catch your solo shows and Decemberists tours whenever I can. (I was the only female in the front row of your Women's Club show in MPLS that wasn't crying). And as an English PhD student, what draws me most to your lyrics is the clear literary influences behind the storytelling. Your songs aren't just songs, they're short stories.

So my question is: who are your favorite authors? What are your favorite books/stories? What do you love reading most? |-| 
|-| cnxcvh9 || 3 || Hi Colin,

About how long does it take you to write the lyrics for a given song? Can you crank them out in a few days, or do they take a lot of thesaurus browsing and revisions before they're the final products? 

I mostly wonder because I've needed to look up some words while listening to your albums (tain, taiga, and bower come to mind), which I don't usually have to do (get to do? I love learning new words) when I listen to music. 

Thank you!
 |-| 
|-| cnxcvq7 || 3 || How many eloquent euphemisms for *ahem* going downtown on your loved one did you come up with before settling on "Open up your linen lap" on "Philomena?" |-| 
|-| cnxcwcv || 5 || Hi Colin! My name is Chris, we had met once at your Wildwood book signing in Boston! I first wanted to let you know that you and your music have been the primary driving force behind my creativity since I was a teen! Since the day I first heard your music, I have made it a lifelong goal to, one day, make material even half as intricate and beautiful as your own. I’m now 26, and you still have yet to let me down, good sir. The new album is lovely, to say the least.

I once tried to write to you in college, as part of an assignment for a writing course, where we had to find a mentor for our work. I tried to write you, but had no clear outlet to reach out. So here we are, I have my chance, and I’m leaning on the good hearts of my fellow redditors to upvote this to a visible level, and I come to you with one simple question… 

Would you ever have an opportunity or desire to mentor an aspiring artist and longtime fan?

P.S. - Tour Name Suggestion: **The Peregrination of Cachinnation** |-| 
|-| cnxcwfm || 104 || Colin! Two questions.

1. I've been covering Make You Better ever since I saw the video a little while back. How was it working with Nick Offerman on set?

2. In the song "We Both Go Down Together", is it a story of star-crossed lovers or is the protagonist a deluded rapist/murderer? 'You wept but your soul was willing' seems a touch suspicious.

Thanks for all the great music you've pumped through my ears. I always maintain that regardless of someone's taste in music, I can dig up at least one Decemberists song they'll enjoy.  |-| 
|-| cnxcwi2 || 5 || The Decemberists are by and large my favorite band of all time. I credit that to your lyricism and songwriting style. 

Your lyrics are know for using language that is not oft-heard in passing conversation. So if you were to pick a single lyric that you have written or perhaps a single word that you are quite fond of what would they or it be? |-| 
|-| cnxcxjx || 3 || Prior to the Charli Hebdo attacks and maybe even prior to 2001, and the focus on Muslim extremism it brought, had it ever occurred to you that something you could draw could have such a significant impact on people that it could result in violence?   |-| 
|-| cnxcy6x || 43 || Hi, Colin! Big fan.

I always imagine the Hazards of Love as a play, with wonderful cut-outs of waves and smoke machines as I listen to the terrific lyrics -- I know you abandoned those plans initially, but have you ever reconsidered possibly going forward with it? |-| 
|-| cnxd0ls || 5 || What does a Decemberists rider contain for the band?  What kind of comforts can you expect at each stop on your tour?

*edit - Oh, and come by /r/decemberists some time. |-| 
|-| cnxd1d5 || 4 || What kind of production will mau5 be bringing? His typical cube setup or the new production he's making for his tour? |-| 
|-| cnxd4de || 5 || Is My Morning Jacket headlining on Friday opposite Drake?  |-| 
|-| cnxd53q || 3 || Can you have Omnibus pressed on vinyl?  |-| 
|-| cnxd9g2 || 3 || Hi Colin, quick question.

What exactly are the benefits of Axe shampoo?

Thanks! |-| 
|-| cnxdanr || 12 || Is there any intended meaning behind the italicized words in the lyrics printed in the linear notes?

This is the best I could come up with, as I am not that smart:

    We did it all for you.
    Alive, more, more bright!
    Whatever--
    
    come to me now,
    limber loping. 
    It won't leave you
    alone.
    Did you skin your knee? Indeed.
    Indeed, indeed.
    
    Jewel crib,
    ribs.
    What a world you have made here
    work!

Love your work, and love the new album.  Thanks! |-| 
|-| cnxdd8n || 9 || Hi Colin!
My 8 year old daughters favorite song is "From My Own True Love (Lost at Sea)" and sometimes I catch her listening to it over and over. Should I start saving for psychoanalysts or just buy her journals and quill pens?

See you in LA (gods willing) with aforementioned melancholy daughter in tow :) |-| 
|-| cnxdi3m || 3 || Any chance of Sir Paul coming to the Big Apple for Gov Ball in the coming years?! Would love to see him close out Sunday night. |-| 
|-| cnxdky9 || 3 || What was the creative process like behind The Mariner's Revenge Song? 

My friend put it on a playlist and I absent-mindedly listened to the song for its tune for a few weeks before really listening to the lyrics and being blown away (or rather feeling a chill). So amazing.

Have a good one!  |-| 
|-| cnxdlpd || 23 || Hello Colin,

As a huge Decemberists fan and the father of a son with autism/Asperger's, I have been heartened by what you've shared--in your music, your social media, and in interview--about your son.   I appreciate your positive perspective on neurological differences and on caring for someone on the spectrum.  "Rise to Me" is one of the most beautiful songs about parenting that I've ever heard.

What does Henry think about "Rise to Me?"  Is he a fan of your music?  Do you find that your idiosyncrasies mesh well with his own obsessions?   |-| 
|-| cnxdpqu || 3 || I guess I'm late to this, but just in case:

* If you could fight one guy you can't (someone fictional, or someone from history) who would it be? What rules and restrictions? What scenario (e.g. Roman Colosseum, medieval battlefield, etc.)?

* When you watch action movies, you see the hero fight off hordes of untrained enemies and win. Obviously this isn't possible in real life, but how many untrained regular people do you think you could take in a fight? Let's define an average person as, say, Adam Sandler. What's your Adam Sandler number? |-| 
|-| cnxdt4x || 4 || Hello Colin,
I recently joined the faculty at University of Montana, so I would love to hear about your Missoula/UM favorites.  Did you have a favorite class/professor?  And where are your three favorite places to eat (breakfast, lunch, dinner)? |-| 
|-| cnxeas3 || 27 || Hello Colin!

Huge fan, love your work, etc. etc.

But it's been really bugging me for years now: Did you ever buy Steven a new bicycle? |-|

|-| cnxg3nl || 9 || Hi Donny, thank you for the great work-out anthem: "Make a Man Out of You" from Mulan. What are your favorite work-out songs and how do you stay in shape? What exercises do you do?

 |-| 
|-| cnxg4lq || 4 || Hi Donny….love you so much!   I lived for The Donny and Marie Show in the 70s.   
I’m a little bit country, and need to know if you are still a little bit rock n roll.  Do you still have a little bit of Motown in your soul? |-| 
|-| cnxg5b6 || 3 || Hi Donny! My mum's a huge fan (and I love Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat). She met Merrill a couple of years ago in London and wouldn't stop talking about it. She would love to know if you would consider rejoining the Osmonds for a UK tour? |-| 
|-| cnxg5rs || 26 || Hi Donny, thanks for doing this AMA. Let me started by saying that we can all agree that reddit in general doesn't really fit into your typical fanbase. Most of us either haven't heard your music or just don't like it after listening to our parents play it for years.


However, I was surprised to find out that you did the vocals for [I'll Make A Man Out of You](http://youtu.be/Fqta4jyAs4k) from Mulan, which is my favorite song from a Disney movie.


Do you have any other hidden gems like this that might get a younger audience interested in your music? |-| 
|-| cnxg6h2 || 6 || Hello Donny, thanks for doing an AMA!

|-| cnxg6vo || 4 || Is it good being back in Vegas?  |-| 
|-| cnxg7sk || 3 || Would you rather:

2. Have a dragon or be a dragon?

3. Stand barefoot on an iceblock for 20 min or be tickled on your bare feet for 20 min?

And Why for each? :P |-| 
|-| cnxg8eo || 3 || Hi Donny! Welcome to Reddit! Your new CD led me to ponder the soundtrack of my own life and I found it hard to narrow down songs. How hard was it for you to narrow it down to the songs that you did record for the album? |-| 
|-| cnxga02 || 13 || Hi Donny, why do you think your "good guy" image has been viewed so negatively and what does that say about society when people like yourself are considered "unhip?" |-| 
|-| cnxgag5 || 10 || You're obviously a Disney fan. Are you looking forward to the new Star Wars by Disney and what do you think of Star Tours at Disneyland? Or if you're not a Star Wars fan, what's super geeky-cool about you that we don't know? |-| 
|-| cnxgbej || 54 || Hello Mr. Osmond,

Back in the 80's you did a concert at Stockton fairgrounds with Milli Vanilli. At that concert you grabbed my mom out of the audience and kissed and/or made out with her. I just want to personally thank you because I have not stopped hearing about this since I was born. I live in fear that someone will mention your name so that my mom will bring up that moment and tell it again in excruciating detail. I could never even enjoy Mulan as a child for fear my mom would run down the hall during "I'll Make a Man Out of You" and pause the movie to tell me the story again. I know I have to ask a question so, do you at least remember this concert, or my mother?

She says Hi by the way... |-| 
|-| cnxgdc8 || 5 || What's your biggest challenge as a musician now? Also what do you think has changed the most in your 50 years in show business? |-| 
|-| cnxgl9f || 4 || Hi Donny. A long time ago I read an interview with Dweezil Zappa about his upcoming album, and he said he had a guest singer "Donny F*cking Osmond!" I thought the quote was so funny that we renamed my little garage band DFO. How was it working with Dweezil? By the way, your vocals on the Stayin' Alive cover were insane - I did not realise just how great a singer you were.  |-| 
|-| cnxgo0l || 9 || Do you wake up every morning and piss excellence? |-|

I'm sure you remember what a hippie weirdo with a heart of gold kind of school it is, and I'm curious what kind of impact it had, if any,  on your style of stand up/career path in general?

I believe you once mentioned in a bit that you got a Creative Writing degree, and I think that comes through as you're more verbose than a lot of other comics

Also, I absolutely love Whiskey Icarus. Keep it up. |-| 
|-| cnxlv72 || 3 || Hey Kyle, big fan. Don't hold it against me but I am Canadian. I was looking forward to seeing you at Sled Island 2014 last year in Calgary until they didn't let you in to Canada.

A female friend and I have had an ongoing debate about the song "We Both Go Down Together." She believes that the narrator is abusing a slave girl (based on the lyric *she cries but her soul was willing*), and I believe the narrator and the girl have fallen in love and commit suicide to be together (escaping social mores). Which were you intending?

thoughts? |-| 
|-| cnxwhy6 || 911 || Joel, 

In 2011 I was living in Los Angeles and my girlfriend came to visit me.  We were casually strolling down hollywood blvd. when I look into a corner store and see you there purchasing cigarettes (i recognized you instantly from the tattoos).

Like a stupid groupie I waited for you to come out to tell you what a huge fan I was an that I just seen you play live for the first time about a month prior.  You were super cool about it and actually was kind enough to take a picture with me.

As i pulled my phone out for the picture, you noticed I had a game boy case on my phone.  You complimented me on it and asked if we could trade cases.  You even offered to sign yours for me.  

I happily obliged but none of us had a pen or marker to sign the case you had just given me.  "Goddam it," I thought.  "Well at least I have the picture and the case.

"But wait," you replied.  "The valet at my hotel has a marker.  Let's go take a walk."   

So holy shit, here I am, walking around Hollywood for about 15 minutes with fucking deadmau5, talking about god knows what.  Are you fucking kidding me?!?  For the life of me, I have no idea what we talked about (I think maybe your asshole neighbor from Toronto came up).

So we arrive at your hotel and as sure as shit, the valet had a sharpie.  You grabbed it, signed the case and sent me on my way.  That is by far the coolest fucking thing that's happened to me.  Easily my favorite story to tell people.  


I just wanted to thank you for going out of your way to hook up a fan. You didn't have to do any of that stuff but it meant a lot to me.  I was on fucking cloud 9.  It really goes to show how much you appreciate your fans.  Even just one. Thanks dude. 

I guess I have to submit a question along with this story or it doesn't count so I guess my question is do you plan on making your way anywhere near New Orleans anytime soon.  God I sure hope so.

|-| cnxyj2w || 8 || Good evening,

I teach at a middle school and teach math one period a day.  Part of our curriculum is giving timed tests.

Using theories of music therapy, I started implementing your music during these tests.  My students increased their test scores on average 26% simply because of your exemplary music.  Now, from 12:00 until 12:20 every day you can hear Deadmau5 blaring across my campus as multiple teachers play your music. 

Thank you for the educational impact you have made on my students; keep up the great music!

Did you ever think, going in, that you'd be mainstream enough to be played in schools? |-|

|-| cob9xo8 || 155 || Thanks for doing this AMA! I've got two questions: 

1. When do you think the LORRI pictures will come back that will turn Pluto and Charon from astronomical objects into geological objects?

2. Have you compared the expected data volume from New Horizons' Pluto encounter to other flyby missions? How does it compare to, say, Voyager 2 at Uranus or Deep Impact at Tempel 1? |-|

|-| cob9q5i || 16 || How has the discovery of additional moons affected the Mission thus far, at what distance from Pluto would you be able to detect as of yet undiscovered moons (preferably expressed in time rather than distance) and would that allow for any additional changes to the plan ? |-| 
|-| cob98hu || 29 || Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA. I've always been curious, what would it take for a spacecraft to be able to orbit Pluto? Could you give us some really rough ballpark figures with regards to the fuel/time/cost requirements for a hypothetical Pluto orbiting mission? Would it be at all feasible with today's technology, or would the weight and other constraints make it totally unfeasible? |-| 
|-| cob9wqo || 31 || 10 years ago I was back in primary school (elementary school for you americans), in Dormansland, England, that there was a man or woman who came over to talk about the mission or something, but can't actually remember much, I was 7-8 and not really interested in space and stuff. 

I do remember getting very excited because we were told that everybody's name in the school had been put onto a CD, which itself would be loaded onto the probe and one day reach Pluto.

I'd forgotten of that day until, pretty recently...

So I googled "New Horizons" and "Dormansland Primary School" and came up to [this](http://www.dormansland.surrey.sch.uk/news/detail/new-horizons/) article, which seems to have a certificate of some kind in it.

I was wondering, do you know of this CD at all, is it real or was it just some kind of marketing gimmick (I wouldn't mind don't worry :p), and if it is real can I know more about it.

Also I really wonder who came to talk about it to us, I doubt it was a NASA person, so maybe a UK Space Agency person, so do you have any relations with them regarding this mission?

Thanks for your AMA, and congrats on the success so far, I can't *wait* to see Pluto! |-| 
|-| cob9e6s || 15 || I understand that the spacecraft getting hit by (micro-)meteoroids during the encounter was a concern earlier in this mission. How big is the risk considered to be now? What countermeasures, if any, is the team taking? |-| 
|-| cob924o || 24 || 1. How much speed are you guys planning to bleed off on the approach? Has most/all of the braking already occurred?

I'll absolutely love an advice from someone who's working at NASA! Was it hard to get a job? Because I read that it's not easy, do you ever get bored? Is it difficult? Do you have enough time to spend with your family or to do your own personal things? I've been counting down the days and I'm so excited and I can't wait for July to arrive so I can imagine how you guys must be feeling right now! It must be an amazing experience right? I know I asked a lot of things that have nothing to do with pluto, sorry about that. |-| 
|-| coblk3z || 3 || First of all I love the New Horizons mission and I am so excited for the first images coming back. 

In terms of Pluto, what are you expecting to find out and how do you think it will affect planetary geology or similar fields?

Now for my silly question: Do any people on your team play Kerbal Space Program and if so, how accurate are the orbital mechanics and physics? Do you enjoy it?

It almost reads like a continuation of the old Dr. Doom style with a couple more decades of experience and a less insecure approach to difficult or potentially unpopular topics.

Thanks. |-|

|-| cobnnjj || 8 || Hey Ryan, I've been following your story since it started.  I've had an exodus from the church of my own, so your story is very relatable.

First of all, I'd just like to complement you on how mature you've handled this transition.  My transition was very frustrating, and I wish I could have handled it better in the face of such ignorant and hurtful comments I received from the countless Christians in my life.  You had the spotlight shining on you during this difficult transition time, and you handled it very well.

Second, I'd like to know what are some of the atheist/humanist reading material you've encountered since the beginning of your atheist-journey that you'd say really has opened your eyes on anything in particular?

Third, was there any atheist reading material you read while you were a Christian?  Or did you wall yourself off from those sorts of influences during your Christian life?

Thanks! |-| 
|-| cobo64i || 8 || Have you been surprised at the intensity of the vitriol displayed by some (apparent) Christians? I've seen some pretty nasty comments directed toward you online. |-|

|-| cob1sz9 || 17 || How do you plan on differentiating Underworld Ascension from the myriad First Person "RPG"s that are on the market today? I ask this because I find it a shame that games like Skyrim, while quite impressive in their own right, have in my opinion dumbed down the genre a fair bit since the days of Ultima Underworld. Will that same depth and complexity be present in Ascension? |-| 
|-| cob1gb0 || 9 || Just wanted to say thanks to you and the rest of Looking Glass for helping create some of the greatest games of my childhood. I chipped into the kickstarter mainly out of gratitude.

|-| cob1buk || 8 || You've got an Avatar in the Stygian Abyss where we see the classic runes from the Ultima games, but this isn't an Ultima game.

Can you clarify what the new IP is and how it correlates to other IP? |-| 
|-| cob1dey || 7 || You have a stretch goal for mod tools which will allow players to make their own content and share them with other players. However, has OtherSide considered allowing crowdsourced assets in the main retail game? |-| 
|-| cob1etp || 7 || Sorry if this has been asked/debated before. What was the reasoning behind using the cliche tolkenesque/D&amp;D dwarves instead of the slightly more original mountain-folk from the classic underworld and bumping the Abyss' Lizardmen from the core game to stretch goals in favor of never before seen dark elves? |-| 
|-| cob2hqp || 7 || If the game is successful can we expect some re-imagining of other former Looking Glass titles like System Shock and Thief? Say yes... please.  |-| 
|-| cob1mty || 5 || Hi, excited about the prospect of playing again a proper first person underground rpg since Arx Fatalis.

Now for the question:

|-| cob1qys || 9 || Will it be possible to play through the game with non-lethal or purely stealth means? |-| 
|-| cob1gtt || 5 || Random question, but what do you guys think of the Demon/Dark Souls seris?

Really looking forward to your game! |-| 
|-| cob1orp || 5 || If the co-op stretch goal is reached, since players represent "the Avatar"... Is there going to be an in lore explanation for a different "the Avatar" showing up in your game is it more going to be handwaved because as players we know it's a multiplayer caveat? |-| 
|-| cob2en4 || 4 || Hi guys, I'm an old Looking Glass UU/SS superfan and really interested in this under-developed genre space. I have two independent questions concerning the design choices you face in this new title.

My first question is about leveling and skill progression; what mechanics do you intend to use? Are you going to borrow a boilerplate XP-reward system, an improve-through-use system like Elder Scrolls titles, or do you intend to approach the question of improvement/levelling in a more unique and innovative way? (I will say that I think ES improve-through-(successful)-use is inherently flawed; skills are learned by failing, not by succeeding).

My second question is about darkness. Since your entire game is set underground it seems reasonable to assume that there will be large, unlit regions. What sort of gameplay challenge/feature does darkness versus light pose in Underworld Ascendant? Let's say you run out of light sources, will this entail a desperate scramble to get back into a lit region at all costs, or will it merely result in a marginal decrease in ambient light level (DS2 I'm looking at you).

Thanks in advance. I'll be sure to be watching this KS very closely! |-| 
|-| cob1v67 || 6 || The kickstarter pitch mentions directional swordplay. What kind of interactive combat system can we expect? Something intuitive yet player steered like mount and blade/chivalry MW/War of the Roses or something even simpler to control enhanced by flashy animations like god of war/devil may cry or maybe something completely different? |-| 
|-| cob1jgk || 3 || In the pitch video, I think it was Tim that said "other opportunities that were cut short when looking glass closed its doors." Were you guys talking about the canceled Deep Cover and the next generation Siege Engine that was in the works and the game was intended to be developed on?

It already says it includes all of the above digital tiers, including the all digital stretch goals rewards from the $75 tier. There are kickstarter exclusive digital rewards in the more expensive tiers below it (silver and gold trim cloaks, jade dagger) and the only other thing on the page that says addons is the Shroud of the Avatar tie in item which clearly states you need to pledge to shroud of the avatar to receive.

Do you plan a DRM-free release? |-| 
|-| cob25m6 || 3 || What I remember most fondly about Ultima Underworld 2 was getting lost. It was as if the world wasn't made FOR me, I was just stuck in it. Finding a new area after hours of searching and being all excited only to find the remains of a previous explorer who lost hope at the same dead end...

With all the internet guides and videos now available, do you plan on making the world more linear to guarantee your content will be seen, or risk making it like a maze where someone who knows where to go can clear the level in minutes?

I would love to get lost again, but I can understand why most games now put the player on rails.

|-| cob27q8 || 3 || Are we going to be facing an impending Armageddon event such as the Slasher of Veils losing his bonds more and more the longer we putter around or will be just be relying on things like hunger mechanics to create that sense of impending peril if we don't keep pressing forward? |-| 
|-| cob2943 || 3 || Just a quick engine tech query:

Will Ascendant use global illumination? |-| 
|-| cob2eqd || 3 || Hello! Things are looking good for the future.

Feel free to answer only what you are comfortable with:

1. How do you plan to innovate combat in terms of melee mechanics? 
The old simplistic ways still present to date in games such as Skyrim no longer cut it.

2. Will interaction systems be based upon the improvements made in Arx Fatalis (the most advanced Immersive Sim in terms of simulated interaction IMO)?

3. What is the final word on the magic system: UU interface rune clicking, Arx rune drawing, or something else?

4. Do you intend to take simulated interactivity to the next level with UA?

5. Is there anything from the original set of games that in retrospect you'd like to move away from? Puzzles, platforming, secret areas, NPC interactions, RPG systems, orienteering/exploration in a vast labyrinth, no handholding, simulation, I hope it all is retained, only expanded upon.  |-|

You say you ask for 40%, well the guy down the street will do it for 30%.  Does that stuff happen or is the reason there are so many is due to certain bail bondsmen have to many cases and just can't handle the load?   |-|

I have a few technical questions about the game: which technologies are used? (Java / PHP / node.js / ... ?)

Out of all the filth (awful pun, sorry)  in your work, the scene that has bothered me the most is undoubtedly the sex scene between Nicki and Sick Boy – the line ‘Then I’m kissing, licking at his eyes, his nose; tasting the salt track from nostril to top lip’ in particular.

|-| cogax75 || 140 || Good morning Mr. Welsh. 
I am a huge fan. Thank you for all of your work.

I have a question that fans have probably asked you a lot already; How come Second Prize was on so many pages of Trainspotting and then he never made it into the movie? Somehow it is just like him not to make the cut. 


My next question is about all of your characters in general. How do you come up with them? Are they based on stories that you hear from people in Scotland? Is Sick Boy a real person? |-| 
|-| cogcxj2 || 45 || Some writers questions -

|-| cogb006 || 273 || Greetings from the West of Scotland, Irvine! Here are my questions:

1. When you were writing some of the scenes in TRAINSPOTTING did you ever think they were a bit fucked up? 

2. Were you worried that your Scottish slang would be difficult for some readers to understand?

3. What are your thoughts on the film adaptations of your novels? |-|

1. Simple one first: What are your favourite films?
2. Do you think the meaning of 'choosing life' has changed from when you wrote Trainspotting to now? How do you think it has?
3. You have the ability to talk to your 21-year-old self. What do you say?

Thank you greatly for this AMA! I hope this finds yeh well! |-|

What were your inspirations for some of the characters from Trainspotting, as well as the story itself? Have you had experience before with addiction? And please suggest one of your favourite pieces that I can read haha.  
  
Sorry for the interrogation, cheers :) |-| 
|-| cogb5yi || 40 || What went into writing the character of Ray Lennox in Crime versus writing him in Filth?

Talks of a Porno movie were happening around last year with even original cast members of Trainspotting talking about willing to come back for it, any that starts to pick up more? 

Love you and your shinny head. |-|

|-| cogbc5t || 38 || Hi Irvine - massive fan here. Have loved you since reading *Trainspotting* back in 94. I once read an interview with you online, I think it was with Kevin Williamson and you were both pilled off your nut, talking about Billy The Fish playing in goal while on one, and you said how free you felt to write anything you liked. Do you remember this interview, and if so, do you know what happened to it? It was *hilarious*. |-| 
|-| cogb8xt || 20 || What books/authors have inspired and motivated you? |-| 
|-| cogbeyx || 17 || Alright Irvine. 

Filth is probably my favourite book and I've started to read Marabou Stork Nightmares, and I got a couple of questions:

- How much do you like the film adaptation of Filth? Was there anything you wished was possible with the picture that was missed from the book? (McAvoy was amazing in it)

- Ever since the Bergkamp mention in Filth I thought you had a soft spot for the Arsenal, but from Twitter I gathered you're more of a Hammers fan, what's the reasoning behind this?

Cheers from East London |-|

|-| cogk0c2 || 14 || Ok, I got suuuuuper excited because I thought you had taken a break from your normal novels, which I do love, to do a research piece on the actual sex lives of Siamese twins.  I am a little disappointed, though the book does look very interesting, and am hoping you might have some answers I would very much like to know.

(I do realize everyone is different and I'm sure the answers run the gambit, but if you know if there is generally accepted practice among conjoined twins or have your own thoughts on the subject I'd love to hear them.) 

1. When a twin is getting busy, does the second one join in?
        -If yes,is it just like an awkward handy or are we going full Mormon polygamy here?
        -If no, does the non participating party wear head phones and construct a pillow fort?

2. Is there any evidence of Siamese twins that have slept with each other's partners? (eg. Sally waits until Lisa is asleep and then has sex with Greg without Sally even knowing (and to that end man, Greg is really digging himself into a hole))

3. If one is aroused does the second become aroused as well or just say something like, "Oh come on Lisa, he's not even cute..." |-| 
|-| cogbbpb || 9 || Hi Mr. Welsh
What was it like working with Jon Baird?

|-| cogbeb1 || 11 || Hi!
First at all, I just want to say that I'm a huge fan of your work. 
I read a couple of interviews so I know a little bit about how much do you put about yourself and about your life in your books. My question is, after the book of "The Sex Lives of Siamese Twins" are you planning to "come back" to Scotland or are you thinking in something different, more in the line of this last book???

A lot of love from a spanish fan! (and Sláinte!)  |-| 
|-| cogc4x4 || 11 || Hello Irvene! You are my favourite author. I have just binged six of your books.
 It is a bit dark, but I always wondered what happened in the woods in Marabou stork nightmares, right before the uncle gets blown up near the jeep? You seem to have an excellent knack for writing about absolute bastards, sickboy has been my favourite so far. Have you had a lot of experience with absolute bastards?

|-| cogdcez || 11 || I never asked you at the time as it was a bit awkward, but you dribbled urine on my shoes at the Murrayfield Hotel before a derby game and I kinda wanted a apology.  Can I get one?  Also I know you are a fan of The Brian Jonestown Massacre.  You ever met Anton Newcome? |-|

My mate Kenny says he went to Electric Picnic with you and some guy called John a few years ago. Is this true or is he at it?

&amp;gt;Yes, it's true. It would John Graham from Musselburgh. Give Kenny my best. Top lad. 

---

What was your inspiration for Filth?

&amp;gt;I worked in Edinburgh Council and there was a crazy guy who hated the world. He hated his bosses, and his subordinates. I thought: make him a cop, then he can do some real damage. There is always a lot of stuff in the papers about dodgy coppers, because its far damaging than dodgy council workers.

Greetings from the West of Scotland, Irvine! Here are my questions:

1. When you were writing some of the scenes in TRAINSPOTTING did you ever think they were a bit fucked up?
2. Were you worried that your Scottish slang would be difficult for some readers to understand?
3. What are your thoughts on the film adaptations of your novels?

&amp;gt;1. Not at the time. But you look back and think, what will people think of you, family, close friends etc. Now I won't write anything unless I get that uncomfortable feeling.
2. Yes. It looked a mess on the page. Couldn't understand it myself at first.
3. Win-win. Crap movie - they fucked up my lovely book. Great movie - they had the material to work with. 

---

what do you think of the gentrification of London?

&amp;gt;It's shit and it's driving people out of the communities they've lived in for years. Much of it is driven by megarich overseas buyers getting big second homes they live in for two weeks a year. Of course, UKIP seek to blame Polish cleaners.

Good morning Mr. Welsh. I am a huge fan. Thank you for all of your work.

My next question is about all of your characters in general. How do you come up with them? Are they based on stories that you hear from people in Scotland? Is Sick Boy a real person?

&amp;gt;You always have to make tough choices when you adapt a book. If everything in the book was in the movie, it would play for about 12 hours. 

&amp;gt;Sick Boy is probably an amalgamation of about 2-3 people. I think all characters are also a little bit a part of the author, or a younger version. 

---

Do you still do drugs?

&amp;gt;I can't really handle them now. You spend so much of your life fucked up that being sober feels quite trippy. If something new and mind-blowing came on the market though...

---

Do most conjoined twins share the same sexuaility/ any cases where they did not share the same sexuailty?

&amp;gt;I don't think they would necessarily share the same sexuality, any more than they would necessarily share the same tastes in music or drinks. 

---

How much Chocolate was used while filming Trainspotting's "worst toilet in scotland" scene?

&amp;gt;There was quite a few Yorkie bars melting in the Glasgow heat that summer.

I read Trainspotting when I was a teenager growing up on a shitty, run-down council estate in Manchester in pretty bleak personal circumstances - it really opened my eyes because I'd never read a book about the kind of world I recognised, I didn't think people wrote books about the underclass. So I became a fan and hoovered up all of your books and any articles I could find by you. You showed me that people from my world could have a voice, and could be taken seriously. 

Years later, I managed to sort my shit out and get a job in journalism in London. My office was in Islington and one day after work I went for a pint in the Old Red Lion. I was killing time waiting for my mates to turn up and I spotted you at the table next to me, enjoying a quiet pint. 

That was a real moment for me - not so long ago I lived a miserable life in a crumbling northern estate without any real hope for making something of myself, but on that day I was in London with a good life, drinking a pint in the same pub as Irvine Fucking Welsh. 

I didn't say hello, because you didn't look like you wanted to be bothered, and I didn't have a clue what I'd say to you anyway. But it meant the world for me to see you there.  |-|

* As someone who profited off the shady 1996 privatizations in Russia, don't you think you should have a bit more introspection before advising that country again on domestic policy? Are you even on record at the time complaining about the bogus auctions? I'd love to see that. That would make you at least consistent on the issue of Russian corruption. 

* Who killed Litvinenko? For a while I assumed it was Putin, but then I looked into the 2004 killing of journalist Paul Klebnikov. Klebnikov had exposed the corrupt Boris Berezovsky, famed oligarch, and I assume an ally of yours during the privatizations. Berezovsky seems to have been allied with Chechen gangsters and possibly [blew up the apartment blocks in 1999](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_apartment_bombings#More_Recent_Explanations). What reason could Berezovsky have had to kill Litvinenko?

As that group has grown, keeping them placated has become more and more difficult. Do you think we're near a breaking point in the kleptocracy — if there is one?

2) Is there hope for a unified european parties. Taking into account the close ties between Syriza and Podemos and some Italian leftists (and some famous French academics such as Piketty)?

|-| cog8pr2 || 4 || Good afternoon, David.

Having been a subscriber of FP for over a year I've enjoyed the analysis you guys bring to the table. One question I'd like to ask:

Do you feel that the recent positive interactions the U.S. has enjoyed with Narendra Modi are merely part of a honeymoon phase, or do you feel that it indicates substantial cooperation with India for the long haul?

Thanks. |-| 
|-| cog8u8l || 4 || Thanks for doing this AMA, I came across FP while in Puerto Rico and as a IR student, I've been hooked on the website since. 

1. What advice can you give to those who aspire to be Foreign Policy analysts or Foreign Affairs journalists?

2. Is there a possibility of seeing FP in UK stores in the near future? |-|

|-| cog8vfr || 3 || Hey David, thanks for doing this! 

Regarding openness in the mainstream media here in the United States, what do you think about what many say is the need for journalists (who hope for successful careers) to provide positively-spun coverage of sacrosanct topics like Israel, the U.S. military, U.S. hegemony, etc.? 

Do you think corporate media owners want reporters who they trust will cover foreign policy issues from a pro-government angle/pro-establishment view of maintaining U.S. extra-regional hegemony?  

Are reporters who seek to provide serious analysis of the motives of the war planners in the White House and the Pentagon generally shunned? 

Thanks!

|-| cog8yim || 3 || Hi David,

I love FP and read it daily. 

Comment: I love your 'Think Again' series. Taking positions opposite to popular opinion and supporting it with facts is always a fascinating read and has widened my worldview.

Question: I know FP is US based. How much consideration is given to a 'global worldview' in your coverage and articles? That is, how do you consider non-American perspectives when writing or choosing articles? |-|

|-| coga2qj || 3 || Mr. Rothkopf, 

I was intrigued by a recent article on the use of [Crowdfunding in the war in Ukraine](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/04/crowdfunding-the-war-in-ukraine-from-manhattan/).  Do you think social media like Reddit could be used for these causes?  Reddit users expressed enormous outrage against ISIS after each beheading, and they have donated millions to more impulsive Kickstarter campaigns like funding a potato salad or a video game.  It's plausible that the two phenomena might coincide in the future.  

What would be the legal repercussions if Reddit crowdfunded a military group like the Peshmerga?   |-| 
|-| coga3dk || 3 || Hi Mr. Rothkopf,

Thanks to you and your publication for being around for all my undergrad years as a great complement to my IR education!

I still want a policy relevant career (and work entry level in international development now). I'm eventually looking to enter the foreign service or a similar channel after going to a good IR grad school. From what you've seen, what are the best ways to prepare oneself for that kind of career after undergrad, keeping in mind grad school might not be possible soon?

To put it more simply, how can I sharpen my position in this field besides piling on another degree?

Many thanks for your answer! |-|

Thanks for doing this. Got a couple of tough ones for you that have stumped this hockey addict. 

A) What do you see different in the Avalanches game this year? It's unlikely that Stastny was THAT much of an impact player. We know everything went right for the Aves last year, but this year...what went wrong?

B) Do you think Stamkos as a perennial 45+ goal scorer has been strongly impacted  by Marty St.louis? This year he seems to be on the downswing with Ty Johnson line picking up some slack, looks like he's working on becoming more of a complete player with Callahan. Do you think Stamkos' scoring numbers trend downwards in the coming years? Do you see him going from being an "elite player" to just a "great" one? |-|
