Australia batted first and smashed the record for most runs scored in a one day match. they scored 434 runs which is absolutely monstrous, the previous record was 398 by Sri Lanka against Kenya in 1996.
 
In South Africa's innings they broke the record again and scored 438.  

This record had stood for a decade and was thought to be an anomaly because good teams like Sri Lanka don't get to play bad teams like Kenya very often. Nobody expected it to happen with 2 teams as good as the Aussies and the Saffers were at the time. |-| 
|-| cnukzjx || 7 || The Wests Tigers vs Sydney Roosters in the 2010 finals series of the NRL.
 
The Tigers were 15-2 ahead and conceded 12 points in the second half until it was 15-14 in the final minutes. With 30 seconds left, the tigers force an (controversial) error and get a scrum feed. Rugby League (the rugby code most popular in Australia) is different to Rugby Union (the code popular internationally) and one of the key differences is the lack of contested scrums. Scrums can still legally be contested but they have been designed to essentially go straight to the feeding team 100% of the time. The only way to really lose a scrum is if you fuck up somehow and the other team clutches at straws and contests the scrum.
 
Needless to say the Tigers fucked up. The Roosters kicked a field goal to level the scores and then won in extra time.
 
As a Tigers fan, it was the worst thing I've seen happen to them. They tried their hardest to lose that game, and somehow they did it.

|-| cnulr1y || 11 || The 1993 AFC wildcard match between the Buffalo Bills and the Houston Oilers. Buffalo was down 28-3 at halftime. Any hope of a momentum shift after halftime was lost when the Bills threw an interception on the opening drive of the second half that was run all the way back for a touchdown making it 35-3 early in the third quarter.  At this point millions of American turned off their t.v.'s and thousands of "fans" left the stadium... The Bills scored 5 touchdowns and a field goal in 20 minutes of play and held the oilers to only a single field goal, tying the game and sending it to overtime, which Buffalo won with an interception and a field goal.  

Quick edit: The Bills accomplished this with their back-up quarterback (Frank Reich). And their star running back (Thurman Thomas) was out of the game with an injury before the comeback started.

tl;dr: Greatest comeback in NFL history, and the reason I never leave a stadium while the players are still on the field. |-|

Team NZ vs Oracle 2013

Just a note on the Rugby, play isn't over until the ball is dead. In rugby, when you're tackled you fight for possession of the ball, and the team already carrying the ball wins it back most of the time. So it ends with some long phases (downs) of the team trying to finally score to equalize. If they fumble it forward, or the other team gets possession, it's pretty much over.

They came from so far behind with the best Ireland performance ever and still won. |-|

|-| cnvs6xw || 4 || If the NFL still enforces a face mask penalty even if it didn't directly impact the outcome of a play, they MUST punish the Patriots for a violation of league rules.

|-| cnvsh4p || 14 || Just curious, when were the balls tested? What about the Colts balls, were they tested? Results?

No refs or Colts players other than Jackson said anything about the balls? |-| 
|-| cnvspzi || 13 || Just because the balls were under-inflated does not mean the Pats had anything to do with it.

It actually speaks more to the refs incompetence than it does subversion by the pats. The balls are submitted to the refs and tested 2 hours before game time from both teams. Then the refs give them to the sideline ball boys who distribute them to the refs as needed. For someone to mess with 12 balls on the sideline during an EXTREMELY televised game and not be noticed is an insane notion.

Also, the refs touched these balls as much or as more (collectively) than any single player and they noticed nothing and took no action. 

 |-|

I am disagree that this is nothing and wouldn't matter if it were another sport or team. Brad Johnson admitted to paying someone to distress ALL the balls in their Super Bowl, not the same thing. The Spurs A/C even if it was orchestrated (which I doubt), went out and BOTH teams had to play in the southern heat. 

I don't think this was the worst thing ever to happen to football, its no where close to the domestic abuse, crime, suicides that have happened because of inactivity at the head office. I do think it does deserve to be talked about and people found breaking the rules should be held liable for their actions. |-|

|-| cnxqfza || -9 || I really don't understand how it could even be remotely considered a scandal.

Almost no one noticed.  Every single ball was deflated roughly the same amount, something COLD WEATHER does.  It also means both quarterbacks had the same balls unless somehow the patriots pumped them up and deflated them over and over.  Where's the competitive advantage?

The only possible advantage would be that balls that are deflated are harder to catch/throw (are they?  I don't know.  It has never said in any article.) and the patriots purposefully practiced with deflated balls so that the other team would have a hard time.

Lastly, it's the refs job to see if the balls are inflated.  Unless you can prove it was done intentionally (unlikely) and prove it somehow only gave the patriots the advantage (I don't see how), then the only people that have any blame here are the refs. |-|

|-| cnxrvub || 3 || I've already responded to many on this thread about this issue: was Anna Kournikova a failure? So there's a few issues to address:

1) What did she achieve?  
2) What is the definition of success?  
3) Is getting more attention than someone who has more success than you "unfair"?  

Answers:  
1) [She was that at one point that is ranked 8th in singles, 1st in doubles in the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Kournikova#1998.E2.80.932000:_Success_and_stardom) and won a few tournments in doubles, reached a some finals (losing to Hinggins &amp; V. Williams). She battled injuries, which eventually forced her to retire.  

2) Although Anna will never go down as tennis great. She clearly had a lot of success in tennis. She was more successful than most girls will ever be. So if your definition of "success" is being #1 at something. She achieved it. If it's being #1 for a lengthy period of time and dominating your sport. Then she failed.  

But by the second measure of success, it means very very few tennis players could ever be a "success". So you have to pick your standard and then apply that to everyone.  

3) It seemed to me that the main issue of contention was that her looks gave her more attention than she would have otherwise. And certainly more than those who were as good or better than her. Of this, there is little debate. Is this fair?  

I don't know, but I like to think of this definition of "fair"^1:     

        'Fair is a place where they judge pigs

|-| cnxs3to || -3 || Just because there are much worse things doesn't mean this was okay, and that we shouldn't be talking about it. The Patriots are in the Super Bowl and they may have broken the rules to gain a competitive advantage. All we will hear the next 3 weeks is stuff about the Super Bowl, and "deflategate" is relevant. If the Ravens made the Super Bowl, or the Vikings, maybe we'd hear about Peterson or Rice, but it's the Patriots. This isn't exactly rocket science.  |-| 
|-| cnxsbgm || 3 || I'm gonna assume, for this post, that the balls were correctly checked before the game. Not a guarantee that it happened, but the only evidence we have that it didn't is the word of a former Bears ball boy.

So the balls were checked in pre-game, were deflated by halftime, but Brady and Belichick had no idea about it? A rogue ball boy deflated the balls Brady chose without anybody's consent?

I really wish this would be over with, as it's so trivial and didn't affect anything. They're just being so sketchy about it (especially Brady in his presser today), it's making them look worse. |-|

It would be like reading about make-up tips from Sports Illustrated. |-| 
|-| cnxvlh1 || 13 || I appreciate this article pointing out the absurdity that something like ball deflation would receive equal or greater air time compared to a grievous infraction like spousal abuse.  I'd go further, and say it's absurd to even compare it to bounty-gate, where people were put in specific physical peril by an illegal incentive system.  

HOWEVER --

Implicit in this article is the notion that there is some kind of conspiracy where "Football" is using deflate-gate to cover up other larger issues.  But the author seems to conflate the separate entities of the NFL &amp; the sports media to support this hypothesis.  They are separate.

NFL first: 
From an institutional standpoint, I guarantee you the last motherfucking thing on earth the NFL wants this year is MORE scandal (no matter how laughable, no matter how harmless) to round out its season.  They just had the goddamned FBI poking through their shit: if you think they want anything but to wrap 2015 up without having to testify in front of a grand jury, you are sorely mistaken.  Even from a product standpoint it makes no sense: the character of their product has already been called into question, why would they add product legitimacy concerns to that?  Per the rules, regulations, and officiating put forth by the NFL so far this season, the Patriots are supposed to be one of the two best teams.  No one at the NFL is “happy” the legitimacy of that fact is being called into question two weeks before the biggest media event of the year.  No one – and certainly not NFL sponsors. 

Sports Media:
This one’s simple: the media is giving this story equal time to graver issues, because it covers EVERYTHING with a full court press.  Here’s a few similarly juxtaposed sports news stories from my recent memory: Jerry Sandusky sexually abuses children in Penn State showers / Tim Tebow takes his shirt off at practice in the rain / Aaron Hernandez pending trial for MURDER / The Superbowl will probably be cold in New Jersey.  Hit the Guide button on your remote and check how many sports channels you have.  Now check how many are on a 24 hour cycle.  There aren’t enough games, there isn’t enough news.  I do some sports writing, and here’s a dirty little secret for you: sports do not lend themselves to entertainment beyond the spectating of the actual games.  The character at your local bar might be entertaining to listen to, but that’s because he’s a shameless homer with an axe to grind and no censor.  To report “sports news” on a national level is a narrow lane: go too in depth, you lose the interest of the casual viewer.  Go too light, you lose the actual fans.  Take a strong viewpoint, say someone “sucks” and you just alienated entire fan bases.  The only way to win is to constantly present new topics and angles.  It’s like the weather: you’ll watch the weather report with RAPT interest: once.  After that, how do you keep people tuning in?  The answer is not in-depth analysis of how Doppler radar works.  Two teams played, one won, there’s not a lot of ways to cover exactly WHY without getting boring for a lot of people.  So does the media love deflate-gate?  YES! They love it because it has a rhyming name, and because it happened.  Because usually NOTHING happens, and they have to pump boring pathetic non-storylines like “Is there still bad blood because Pete Carrol coached the Patriots 18 fucking years ago?”  That fact, however, does not mean there’s some kind of memetic conspiracy afoot.

TLDR: NFL is not happy with any scandal.  Media is happy with any scandal.  Article author is way out on a limb. |-| 
|-| cnxw4o0 || 3 || Who wants to win a game that you didn't win because you are better.  What a great sport |-| 
|-| cnxw53r || 3 || Cool I didn't realise Tennis had the common sense and flexibility to allow this. I don't see the NBA allowing their players to do anything similar. |-| 
|-| cnxwgj2 || 3 || It's the perfect scandal because it's a relief from all the other bullshit, like corked bats in the era of steroids. |-| 
|-| cnxwh4l || 5 || I'm about 110% sure the pats still would have won that game.  |-| 
|-| cnxxqp3 || 3 || I'm sure that in the off-season the NFL will sponsor prime-time commercials featuring celebrities and players getting all choked up about deflating balls below the league minimum. |-| 
|-| cnxxxsf || 3 || Weren't there hundreds of comments in the previous cricket catch threads from Americans going on about how easy the catches were? |-|

|-| cny0ci2 || 4 || League was brutal before the shoulder charge was banned. blah blah blah learn to wrap up...

Shoulder charging someone running straight at you was the best feeling ;) |-| 
|-| cny1n25 || 41 || Here's the deal. As a football fan, I don't look to the NFL for moral leadership. Before Adrian Peterson and before Ray Rice and before Ray Lewis and before Dante Stallworth, I never said "look at those NFL players, they're probably all upstanding members of society". 
I watch football because some of the best athletes on the planet run full speed at each other with violent intent. It's great. 
So while it's awful seeing what some players have done recently, in my mind the NFL has no responsibility and I have no expectations of them. That's the law's job. If they prosecute, great. If they don't, they probably didn't have enough evidence. 
But when teams start cheating (don't care if it was a blowout, breaking league rules to gain an advantage is cheating no matter how you spin it), it ruins the game. And the GAME is the only reason I care about the NFL. So you can try to downplay this because of the comparison to more awful things, and I won't argue. As a human being what Adrian Peterson did is infinitely worse than whatever it was a patriot did. But I still care more about the balls - in the scope of the NFL - than about any other scandals.  |-| 
|-| cny36gh || 3 || Fuck the pats |-| 
|-| cny48o9 || 4 || I'm not into sports anymore, but I used to be into baseball until the steroid scandal blew wide open.

There is a reason why sports are fun, its called 'sportsmanship'. You know, where you put aside your personal pride to accept and embrace the fact that your opponent is putting just as much effort into the game as you are, and that whatever the outcome, you can hold your head up and say 'not only did I try, I did'.

On the one hand, you have the apparent fact that the Patriots were so insecure in their ability to pull this game through that someone was doctoring the balls. On the other hand, you have the Colts, who not only lost, but are now robbed even of their honor with the #1 remark being made in defense of them is 'well the Colts would have lost either way'. There are turnovers that may or may not have happened.

The unspoken rule in sports is this: as a fan, you're allowed to daydream about 'what could have been' all you want. But actual uncertainty about whether you could have turned things around if the other team hadn't cheated? That's worse than losing, because without the certainties of victory, defeat, or tying, you're not playing a game, you're attempting to take advantage of it. |-| 
|-| cny4iww || 3 || God damn. I couldn't read half of that due to the condescending attitude to the whole article.  |-| 
|-| cny5cfb || 4 || It's just so benign and arbitrary. I don't think I have ever seen the media blowing anything out of proportion quite like they are with this. Do I think my favorite team did it? Absolutely. People are calling for us to forfeit the game, suspend Brady for the SB, and fire Belichick. Pump the fuckin' brakes, people! Three weeks ago Suh (already a repeat offender), [stomped on Aaron Rodgers' leg intentionally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smjo0iLDB_I) , intentionally tried to cause physical harm to another player (who happens to be one of the faces of the game), and wasn't suspended. 

People are saying we are known cheaters. How is this for a career cheater? Pete Carroll. He [burned USC's football powerhouse to the ground](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California_athletics_scandal) , and walked out on them, Scot free, as the penalties were being handed out. The NCAA revoked a national fucking title, and the Heisman Trophy! He now coaches the #1 team in PED suspensions in the NFL. Shit, one of our guys, Brandon Browner, missed the first four games this year for a failed drug test in Seattle. Why hasn't anyone said that their Super Bowl win is tainted? 

Why hasn't the NFL launched an investigation into Aaron Rodgers' inflationgate? Why isn't anyone calling for his 2011 MVP to be revoked? Jim Nantz and Phil Simms announced on the Sunday night game that Aaron Rodgers was breaking the rule, and nobody thought twice about it. Nantz reported that Rodgers told him, ['I like to push the limit to how much air we can put in the football, even go over what they allow you to do and see if the officials take air out of it.']( http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/new-england-patriots/post/_/id/4776728/jim-nantz-phil-simms-discussion-adds-context-to-deflated-football-talk). Rodgers has continued to openly confess that he does this, and the refs catch it, and deflate the balls, seemingly regularly. Seems like the NFL could build a solid case against him. 

If the NFL gave a shit about tampering with the footballs, then they would already have a protocol in place, similar to MLB, where the balls are in the possession of the league/umpires until the umpire puts the ball into play. In a league that micromanages the game to death, they don't give a fuck what happens to those balls after kickoff. If they did Aaron Rodgers head would be on a spit in Goodell's office box in NY. One exception... Tom Brady, apparently. 

Punishment. The crime is synonymous with stick'um on a WR's gloves, or a MLB pitcher throwing a spitter. Issue a warning, threaten ejection, and take corrective action. The moment the league measured the balls, a 15 yard penalty should have been issued for unsportsmanlike conduct, and that should have been the end of it. The officials dropped the ball on that, and now all of the blowhards on ESPN and CNN are treating this like they caught Tom Brady beheading reporters in Iraq. 

Go Pats!  |-|
