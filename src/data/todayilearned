- It has about 1/3rd of Earth's surface gravity  
- It's only about 70% as dense as earth

|-| cntv94z || 66 || Although the equator is the best place to launch from to get into orbit it isn't the best place to launch from to go to the moon. The moon doesn't orbit along the Earth's equator but is actually inclined by about 5 degrees. 

Earth is tilted over by 23 degrees which means the moon has a 28 degree inclination from the equator. Cape Canaveral is 28 degrees from the equator which means a rocket launching from there is already on the correct inclination to go to the moon.

The Russians used to launch from Baikonur which is 45 degrees from the equator which meant that their moon missions had to change inclination once in orbit which meant less weight for a payload(because of the extra fuel of the inclination change). In the end none of this mattered because they couldn't get their N1 moon rocket to work but if they could they would have always been at a disadvantage against the US just because of geography. |-|

It's a tiny rock sitting in an unimaginably vast void, far greater than humans can really comprehend. To paraphrase Carl Sagan, it's like a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. Think of the most barren, inhospitable place you can on Earth. The South Pole perhaps, or Death Valley. Reaching and surviving in that place for a year would still be 1,000,000* times easier than reaching and surviving a single day on Mars.

|-| cntxzxt || 7 || On Gilbert Gottfried's podcast, which I just listened to today (Carl Jung would have called this "synchronicity"), the great Billy West (former Howard Stern show cast member, the voice of Fry, Professor Farnsworth, and Zoidberg on "Futurama", the voice of Ren &amp; Stimpy, and a million other voices) told a story about how he used to live on the same street as one of the Munchkins.

He always wanted to introduce himself, but he never knew how.  Occasionally he would drive by the Munchkin's house and wave to him when he was outside, but the Munchkin would just scowl back at him.  

I think now we know why.

Billy said the Munchkin had a jet-black dyed mustache and always wore a black cowboy hat.  He said he looked like some sort of tiny villain.

So one day, Billy's driving by Mr. Munchkin's house, and he sees the Munchkin on his tiptoes, reaching into his mailbox.  As Billy drives by he puts on a deep, ominous voice and says "PUT THAT BACK!".

Billy telling the story is much funnier.  It starts @6:48...

To the posters who say shit like

It is totally different. They did NOT get paid because something shitty happened to them. They got paid to settle claims against the airlines INSTEAD of being allowed to sue.

If you have a car accident you can sue the other driver and get paid.

The government decided that instead of allowing many thousands of lawsuits against the airlines and all their associated court costs it would be better to just make payments under a specific law.

Remember the lawsuits would have destroyed the airline industry AND their insurance companies which could have destroyed the economy. So it could be reasonably argued that the approach made sense for the good of the country. |-|

Short track speed skating is all about strategy and agility, and rarely about pure physical speed. 'Can I cut in here', 'do I have the edge to make it around there', etc.  Steven Bradbury wasn't 'lucky', he just used a conservative strategy that emphasized low risk taking.  One can argue that it was the best strategy for a skater who didn't have the physical skills of the top skaters, but it was a strategy, nevertheless.

It's like an American football team deciding not to pass during a rainy game, or a football team that plays hard for an early lead then keeps everyone behind the ball all game, etc.  If it works, the response shouldn't be 'lucky', the response should be 'well played'.

Well played, Steven Bradbury.   |-|

Contact with oils in mango leaves, stems, sap, and skin can cause dermatitis and anaphylaxis in susceptible individuals.[50] Mango oil contains mangiferin and a resinol called mangiferol.[citation needed] Those with a history of contact dermatitis induced by urushiol (an allergen found in poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac) may be most at risk for mango contact dermatitis.[51] Cross-reactions may occur between mango allergens and urushiol which is present in mango leaves and stems.[52] During the primary ripening season of mangoes, urushiol is the most common cause of plant dermatitis in Hawaii.[53] |-|

|-| cnudqmi || 10 || Just to play devil's advocate for a sec: they were not paid entirely with vouchers—they were compensated "in part" by them. 

Given the peso's instability over the past 20 years, it wouldn't surprise me if the voucher program was implemented in some sort of well-intentioned but poorly thought out plan to offer employees a degree of financial protection in the event that their wages could not pay for the basic commodities that Walmart sells due to rapid inflation even though they could a week or a month ago or whatever. This is assuming of course that the employee vouchers' values weren't fixed to the peso. 

Still a terrible plan, but I have a feeling the whole case was more complicated than Walmart executives just being plain evil. 

If anyone has more details about the case I would be interested to read more. I can't find many English news articles about the case and the ones out there are pretty light on the details.

|-| cnuedqc || 5 || I feel like this could use a little context.  
  
In Mexico during the 19th century, payment to laborers with scrip vouchers was a widespread practice ("Tiendas de Raya"). After the 1910 Revolution Movement, getting rid of this practice was one of the most important points of the 1917 Mexican Constitution (Art. 123).  
  
It's common among Mexican employers to provide a bonus to their employees ("Vales de despensa") which can only be redeemed by purchasing groceries, medication, etc. (kinda like US food stamps).  
  
Walmart took a new approach to this. By coercing their employees to exchange a small chunk of their salary into these vouchers, masquerading them as "vales de despensa", with the twist that they were only to be redeemed at Walmart stores, also they were not bonuses at all. Hiding it on the small print of their employees' contracts.  
  
It wasn't until 2008 that an employee (Raúl Ávila Andujo) realized he was being scammed out of a good part of his salary (5%) by Walmart and took it to Court. The contract was then declared invalid (unconstitutional by art. 123) and Walmart was forced to stop this practice.   |-|

|-| cnug4a5 || 9 || &gt;The CIDA strategy report states that "as of 2000, 70 percent of the worlds poor live in rural and remote areas, where access to information and communications technologies, even to a telephone, is often scarce—over one-third of the world population has never made a telephone call."

This report is 15 years old, from before cell phones were affordable or ubiquitous even in developed nations.  The beginning of this millennium has seen wide proliferation of cheap pay-as-you go phones in developing countries, with greater access to information available to the vast majority of the world. You even see mobile carriers in developing nations offer free access to resources like Wikipedia. A 2013 Pew Global study explains this change, the one-third of humanity who had never made a telephone call lived beyond the reach of landline infrastructure. Now these people and their families have access to cell phones. 
&gt;More than half of the population in each of the nations surveyed say they own a cell phone. Roughly nine-in-ten or more own mobile phones in Jordan (95%), China (95%), Russia (94%), Chile (91%) and South Africa (91%).

&gt;Cell phone ownership rates have skyrocketed in the last decade in most of the nations where data on trends is available. The pervasiveness of cell phone ownership in these nations is in part due to a lack of landline connections. Across the 24 countries, a median of only 23% say they have a working landline telephone in their house, including as few as 1% in Ghana and Kenya. Instead, many emerging and developing nations have skipped landlines and moved straight to mobile technology.

|-| cnuglp0 || 11 || In 1969, Jackson and several other students held members of the Morehouse College board of trustees (including a nearby Martin Luther King, Sr.) hostage on the campus, demanding reform in the school's curriculum and governance.[14] The college eventually agreed to change its policy, but Jackson was charged with and eventually convicted of unlawful confinement, a second-degree felony.[15] Jackson was then suspended for two years for his criminal record and his actions. He would later return to the college to earn his Bachelor of Arts in Drama in 1972.[16]

While he was suspended, Jackson was employed as a social worker in Los Angeles.[17] Jackson decided to return to Atlanta, where he met with Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap Brown, and others active in the Black Power movement.[13] Jackson revealed in the same Parade interview that he began to feel empowered with his involvement in the movement, especially when the group began buying guns.[13] However, before Jackson could become involved with any significant armed confrontation, his mother sent him to Los Angeles after the FBI told her that he would die within a year if he remained with the Black Power movement.[13] |-|

If gold is $1,250/oz, and counting the 50% loan out at the pawn shop, that works out to 3.5 pounds of 24K gold.

Fuck that. No. The American way is to sell a solid product that you are proud of handing over for good hard won cash. When you sell a product that is doomed to failure, and in the process of said, you are *swindling* your client. Business can be rough, but nobody should disrespect people handing them money, especially 3 fucking billion USD, enough to sell them a sham. 

Now, the only possible reason anyone has to bother doing business with him is the massive stacks of cash that they hope to swindle from *him* before they get high enough on his radar to be swindled themselves. A motherfucker like that has to sleep with a blade under his pillow. Thieving begets thievery. You want honest and honorable labor that will look out for your and your company's best interest? Be honest and honorable. Otherwise, you're dealing with a den of jackals.

Then the insurance company can raise the insurance rate for the cop. When you have a shit cop, he will no longer be able to be insured or be able to afford the insurance that covers his ass. Problem solved.

Also, good cops who do nothing to stop a bad cop? Accomplices. Charge them with a crime. Make it extremely harsh. They should be policing themselves as well as the population and they should hold each other to a very high standard. Only then will we ever have good cops. |-|

By the time you have been brought up to a judge and received an amount set for bail all your items on your person are not available.  You can have a third party like a lawyer, family, friend, etc.  bring in bail but you cannot ask for items you had to give to someone to pawn or sell...

When you get booked, the first thing they do is strip search you ("Lift up your junk...") and all your clothes, watch, jewelry, cash, wallet are inventoried and put in a big Ziplock bag. Then you get your phone call. You cannot ask "Yo can I get that Rolex out of my bag?" During my bid I was in 8 separate jails and prisons and not once was the procedure any different.

Cash is counted in front of the suspect and at least 2 COs. It is then sealed and put in the Ziplock. Unless you flip your chain to your boy as they are dragging you away from the crime scene, you can't use personal possessions to get bail. Jewelry not confiscated? rofl, send a guy with a gold chain into a detention bullpen and watch what happens.

When I got my Ziplock back five years later, my Bell &amp; Ross watch was gone, my 1 ct gold stud was gone, but the cash was there. Unless it's a bunch of crooked cops, you can't do anything with your jewelry except throw it in the bag. |-|

&gt; *Erskine was killed on the night of July 18, 1975, near the Packwood Home in Sandys; Neville died on July 30, 1974, on the nearby stretch of Middle Road known as Hog Bay Level*.

* So it was **not** exactly a year later
* It was **not** at the same intersection.   It wasn't even on the same road.  It was just nearby.


Was it the same passenger?  To quote *"According to their father, John Henry Ebbin of Woodlawn Road, Sandys, even the passenger in the taxi was the same in both instances"*

So a grieving father believed it was the same passenger .. which may be true (or not).

So perhaps we could phrase it as:

* The same taxi driver was involved in two fatal accidents about a year apart.
* As it was a small-ish town, both accidents involved people from the same family.
* One surviving family member believes it was the same passenger in the taxi.

Is that an incredible coincidence?

&gt;PS: I tried to do a bit of research.  There was a John Henry Ebbin (92 years old) in Bermuda at the time, which makes it less likely to be the right John Henry Ebbin, given a 17 year old son!)

While many people believed this was another example of celebrity going to their heads, the provision was actually included to test whether the promoters had actually read the contract. According to David Lee Roth:

&gt; The contract rider read like a version of the Chinese Yellow Pages because there was so much equipment, and so many human beings to make it function. So just as a little test, in the technical aspect of the rider, it would say "Article 148: There will be fifteen amperage voltage sockets at twenty-foot spaces, evenly, providing nineteen amperes ..." This kind of thing. And article number 126, in the middle of nowhere, was: "There will be no brown M&amp;M's in the backstage area, upon pain of forfeiture of the show, with full compensation."

&gt; So, when I would walk backstage, if I saw a brown M&amp;M in that bowl ... well, line-check the entire production. Guaranteed you're going to arrive at a technical error. They didn't read the contract. Guaranteed you'd run into a problem. Sometimes it would threaten to just destroy the whole show. Something like, literally, life-threatening.

By 2020, the two chocolate-makers warn that that number could swell to 1 million metric tons, a more than 14-fold increase; by 2030, they think the deficit could reach 2 million metric tons. |-|

He wrote the screen play for the real "I Robot", a more realistic science fiction movie actually based on Asimov's stories.  he recounts that during the presentation / approval meeting some unknown studio bigshot makes some comments that showed he ahd not read the script. Harlan then asked him what he thought about scene X and scene Y, neither of which were in the script - and the studio exec said he loved them too. 

Harlan the proceeded to tell the guy in front a full meeting of his studio - "Seriously, your job is to commit 20 million dollars of the studio's money to this project and you have not even bothered to read the script?! What kind of moron are you?!"

Needless to say, he gone the "you'll never work in this town again" speech, which appears to have been true, and his script was never made into a movie - but he then published it as a book.  |-|

|-| cnv5xt7 || 4 || Another, applied, example is the duck technique in corporate programming: a programmer expects their corporate office to insist on a change to something (anything at all) on every presentation to show that they're participating, so a programmer adds an element they expect corporate to remove on purpose. Quoted from Jeff Atwood's blog, Coding Horror:[8]

*This started as a piece of corporate lore at Interplay Entertainment. It was well known that producers (a game industry position roughly equivalent to project manager) had to make a change to everything that was done. The assumption was that subconsciously they felt that if they didn't, they weren't adding value.*

*The artist working on the queen animations for Battle Chess was aware of this tendency, and came up with an innovative solution. He did the animations for the queen the way that he felt would be best, with one addition: he gave the queen a pet duck. He animated this duck through all of the queen's animations, had it flapping around the corners. He also took great care to make sure that it never overlapped the "actual" animation.*

*Eventually, it came time for the producer to review the animation set for the queen. The producer sat down and watched all of the animations. When they were done, he turned to the artist and said, "That looks great. Just one thing: get rid of the duck."*

|-| cnv7g4z || 41 || It took nearly six months but the General Medical Council (GMC) in the U.K. has pulled Dr. Andrew Wakefield’s license to practice medicine in the United Kingdom.

Wakefield is the researcher who nearly single-handedly fueled parental concerns about the link between vaccines and autism. In 1998, he published a paper in the medical journal Lancet describing eight children who showed signs of autism within days of being inoculated for measles, mumps and rubella. A gastroenterologist by training, Wakefield went on in further studies to suggest that the virus from the vaccine was leading to inflammation in the youngsters’ guts that then impeded normal brain development.

Further investigations by other researchers in the decades since have failed to confirm his claims, and in January, the GMC ruled that Wakefield had acted “dishonestly and irresponsibly” in conducting the experiments that led to the publication of the paper. According to the BBC, among his alleged acts of misconduct were conducting those studies without ethical approval of the hospital at which he practiced, and paying children at his son’s birthday party for blood samples. He also served as a paid consultant to attorneys of parents who believed their children had been harmed by vaccines. |-|

The former (the harmless one) was used as a material to preserve vaccines, making one vial enough to vaccinate many people, but anti vaxers used fear mongering to get people to freak out over how there was a variety of mercury in vaccines, forcing the CDC to remove it from them even after a study showed that it was harmless. Now it takes a lot more material to vaccinate a person and vaccines are way more expensive.  |-|

|-| cnvh06k || 69 || This is a topic of a lot of debate. In the medical world (I'm a doc - and have read everything from how smoking prevents Parkinsons to how vaccines cause autism (all peer reviewed) you can find anything peer reviewed. It all depends how much money you invest into your scientist. I have published a study on neurological mechanics and the process is time consuming and grueling. 

We had to study Andrew W. MD as part of our study and in all of his many errors - he was in-fact paid off by multiple companies to find a consensus that he would financially benefit from, he was a great research doctor. 
Look at todays Big Pharma companies, they pay to have specific research hidden and will find "ideal" population groups at random with decreased risk factor and side effects to retest until they have a positive result. This is no different.

The real story of Andrew W. MD is he never said vaccines cause autism (read this in Paul Offit MD - Autism's false prophets). He said multiple strain vaccines have a link to autism, and it would be safer to vaccinate with single strain vaccines.

ie: Instead of Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) all in one, to use each separately from his company. 
Wrong, Yes, Possibly. But in medical research this is a daily event. He is highlighted because his story is easy for people to digest.

Andrew Wakefield = Anti Vaccine = Many People Sick

Here is your everyday story, Birth control causes clots at 3%, find new population group, restest 2.8%, change formula (minor) - Retest 2.9%, Add in another 1.5 million dollars, screen for females ages 18-26 caucasian - no family history of clots, all active, all under normal BMI, restest, new statistic at .4% - study states, no significant risk of blood clots.

Just my 2 cents. What Wakefield did was super wrong and I think that every child deserves and has a right to vaccination. I think that unbeknownst to the public is that medical publications can be very jaded depending on the funding, and that to really understand and make a statement it is helpful to look at multiple A level studies from MESH.  |-|

|-| cnvick6 || 45 || When our pediatrician, and his team of specialists, told us our 2-year old son had autism, we were crushed.  This was in 1997, and--aside from a Dustin Hoffman character--we didn't know thing one about the condition.  Our son had not yet learned to speak, had some unusual mannerisms and odd rituals, and Doc told us we might never know our son in the traditional sense.

Like most parents, we got proactive after rivately grieving over the fact we might never speak, or be spoken to, by our beautiful little angel, and composing ourselves for the battles ahead.  We got into the books, and devoured everything we could.

In 1997 there wasn't much.  Handful of pop, "how-to" guides about the typical autistic child, by Dr.s Child, Oishi, and others.  A couple very technical books; difficult for non-medical types like us.  An anonymously-published personal tale of an apparently well-to-do mother, her two autistic daughters, and the specialists they hired privately... who (the author claimed) *cured* both girls.  Some literature by a man named Stanley Greenspan (this was, in retrospect, the most useful material).

We did as much as we could, sifted through the different advice, sought out the handful of support groups in our area.  There wasn't much to the internet at the time -- we'd never been online.

I went to watch Temple Grandin speak in New Mexico.  We sought out the snake oils too.... vitamin *this,* supplement *that.*  Started doing deep compressions, actually looked into getting a hyperbaric chamber, and even discussed allowing our son to take place in a study at our hospital, wherein experimental injections of (I can't recall--some BS that didn't work) was occurring.  

And then we came to our senses.  Realized we'd done what most anyone would do at that point.  Reaching for straws.  We did none of the vitamin/supplement stuff.  None of the special diets.  No fancy compression/hyperbaric equipment.  And certainly nothing experimental. 

We *did* get our son into Occupational Therapy.  And Speech Therapy.  We *did* fight tooth and nail with our insurance company to help defray the costs.  

We mainstreamed him in school, got very familiar with his teachers, counselors, and program administrators.  We pushed him, gave him the happiest childhood we could, and by the time he entered high school, he was -- from any outsider's perspective -- a quiet and solitary, but intensely intelligent, "normal" student who took classes along with every other "normal" student.

Today he's a Sophomore in college, has a 3.9 GPA, enjoys writing, walking, music, and drawing.  He's a walking encyclopedia of trivia.  He's the sweetest guy you'll ever meet, and we couldn't be prouder.

But instead of dawing this to some rightfully cathartic end, I want to touch upon my cousin.

She also has an autistic child, just a couple years younger than our son.  But she is a **huge** proponent of the anti-vaccine, pseudoscience quackery.  When she and her husband received their news, we lived halfway around the world (I was military).  By the time my cousin and I saw one another again, she was beyond looking for advice from her cousin.  She'd figured it all out, and you'd think Jenny McCarthy was the second coming.  I simply cannot talk any sense into her.  She and her husband have invested thousands in diets, the hyperbaric chamber, taking their child to various quacks around the nation, you name it.  

Yet their child, though doing well, hasn't made the kind of progress our son has.  Granted, every child is different.  You'd be hard-pressed to locate two autistic children with exactly the same level of severity, or identical idiosyncrasies.  

But I know my cousin has taken the wrong course, and it's a goddamn shame. 

EDIT: mended a couple instances of genuine cerebral flatulence.  Hyperbolic? LOL, yes that was a classic. And forgive me any fans of Jenna Jameson, for confusing her with McCarthy.  |-|

I realize this study is completely bogus but I feel that there is some misperceptions in that a small N on its own is inherently bad.  I know we learned in intro stats that small Ns are not good, but this focuses on one type of validity - statistical validity, but theres more to having a valid study than just that.  In fact, single case experimental designs have been around for a long time.  Single case designs just have different threats to validity (internal external etc) that the researcher needs to control for (perhaps using the ABA or ABAB method) but they are still experimental and still valid as long as they are designed and carried out properly.  This guys type of experimental design is one where small N is bad, but don't look at all studies with small Ns as invalid without a truly good understanding of the experimental design they are using. |-|

When there's an improvement in worker's productivity, what basically happens is :

2-Boss becomes aware of that, so he gives more work to the worker, then he gets more money (if he's clever he can anticipate step 1)  
3-Due to competition, prices drop, so now the customer saves money  
4-People are richer, so money value drop, and everything is back to normal

As Feynman noted,

&gt;I think the educational and psychological studies I mentioned are examples of what I would like to call cargo cult science. In the South Seas there is a cargo cult of people. During the war they saw airplanes with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now. So they've arranged to make things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head to headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas--he's the controller--and they wait for the airplanes to land. They're doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn't work. No airplanes land. So I call these things cargo cult science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they're missing something essential, because the planes don't land.

Basically housing and health care inflation has taken all of our rising producing power, leaving us poorer than we should be.

|-| cnvszw5 || 32 || You know after the discovery/invention of agriculture, people had a lot more free time because they didn't have to waste it all on getting food, and that's how we broke the rat race with nature and started building civilization.  It would have been completely insane had we let the benefits of agriculture only accrue to a few people and force everyone else to keep hunting and gathering.

But now, the Internet and other technologies have basically made our species waaaay more capable and productive (cat pictures and pornography jokes aside), but we still haven't accepted that not everyone has to keep working 40 hours per week in order for everyone to have more than enough to live well, because the 40 hour workweek is built into all of our institutions and in our economy and society.

By telling everyone they have to work 40 hours a week in the rat race when there isn't even that much work that needs to be done, society is fucking stupid and should be ignored.

Technology has advanced to a point that not everyone has to be "working" so much in an insane rat race just to live and survive, and it's insane and counterproductive to pretend otherwise.

It's time we take down the plutocracy and start taking care of people instead of letting our feudal overlords bully everyone else and steal more and more for themselves.

We are responsible for living our lives according to what's right and reasonable, but we have zero responsibility to live according to the bullshit rules/norms set by our plutocrats.  If anything, our responsibility is to challenge and change that corrupt system.

As reddit user sumthingcool put it,

[On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs](https://libcom.org/library/phenomenon-bullshit-jobs-david-graeber)

[In Praise of Idleness](http://www.zpub.com/notes/idle.html)

[Humans Need Not Apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU)

The thing is, rights and resources are distributed on the basis of leverage, not productivity and not on what's sane or moral or reasonable.  Slaves were extremely productive, but they didn't earn any money because they had no leverage.  Industrial era workers were extremely productive, but they were shit all over because they had no leverage.  

And that's why we needed collective bargaining and a labor movement in order to get the 40 hour workweek, workplace safety laws, and basic worker protections in the first place.  

And human nature has not changed - capitalists didn't voluntarily give workers fair wages and rights, workers had to fight them tooth and nail.

And the same dynamic is happening now - plutocrats like the status quo where they don't have to give up any of the resources because they have the institutional power to get away with taking it all for themselves.

If we want a nation of shared prosperity and not one where all of the benefits of technological and social advancement accrue to just a few people with the power to bully everyone else, then we have to challenge their power.  

Step by step, drop by drop, de-brainwashing one person at a time if need be, but it is now our turn to challenge unjust, illegitimate power and fight for a better future for our nation and ultimately the species. |-|

Just a few things from someone with first hand experience.

I spent about ten years in far north Queensland whilst I was in the Australian Army (1st Battalion RAR), much of which was spent slogging through the rain forests of the Atherton tablelands, training.
I personally encountered Gympie twice in that time and saw its effects on many others and I wish I hadn't.

First up a little thing about Gympie. It may be known scientifically as gympie gympie tree but colloquially it is just gympie and I may not be a botonist but whenever I've seen it, it's looked more like a bush than a "tree" to me. We always knew it as gympie bush. 

The broad heart shaped leaves are covered in small hair like "needles" composed of silica. These hollow hairs contain the toxin which produces the burning pain associated with contact. Brush against the leaves and they snap off and lodge in the skin releasing the toxin directly to the nerves. The immediate reaction is to scratch/brush away/rub the affected part. Not good. It just lodges these silica "syringes" further into the skin. Therein lies the problem.

The toxin is painfull but you get over it. Any pressure on the affected area is painfull but only for a week or so. The silica hairs however stay in your skin for much much longer, the capillary action of the hairs delivering whatever you put on your skin straight to the nerve endings.
 
I was stung on the hands and for about nine months after that I had the "electric shock" sensation spoken of in the article whenever I tried to wash my hands, whenever I spilt a liquid on my hands, heck, whenever it got overly humid (we were living in the tropics :/ ). This is distinct from the the initial burning pain of being stung which is a hoot in itself. These are not plants you mess with.

|-| cnvvhy6 || 7 || In the Mage: The Awakening RPG (Dresden Files + Theosophy + The Matrix + Indiana Jones) there's a book called *Summoners* about strange things that modern day Mages can summon, accidentally or intentionally.

The chapter "On Stranger Shores" lists stuff that isn't part of the traditional cosmology of the setting, with creatures and entities that come from places Mages don't even understand. One of them is the *atakai*. Strange plane shaped entities summoned by the cargo cults clearing runways and performing rituals. They might be missing a wing or flap their wings, or just generally not look the way that a plane should. They sometimes airdrop powerful magic items and food and supplies to the people of the islands.

That section of the book was *fucking terrifying*. One of the ways of summoning the atakai is building a wooden Cessna and then lighting it on fire while someone is trapped inside. If you go into one of the planes after it lands, you'll be taken to the "Prime Material" where your body will start to calcify and turn into an object. No one knows where they come from.

The chapter also had Men in Black that hunted down people who'd witnessed magic, strange quincunx patterns that made people insane, ghosts operating Numbers Stations trying to raise up the Underworld, and also a nasty poisonous dragon that sometimes appeared as a wyvern and was slain thousands of times over by Mages who wanted her venom. |-| 
|-| cnvvhzh || -3 || alright, truth time. I learned this tale in anthropology class but I don't have sources beyond that lecture.

so, you've got all these tiny islands the Japanese decided to colonize in their whole pan-pacific empire idea, and the japanese are racist dickheads to the locals.

but heck, can't let communism take hold on our little buddies! we just got done setting them free! 

oh, but you can't get in and out of there without a lighted airstrip and that looks pretty suspicious, they might be kinda fucked, but despite being small they don't want to be somebody's colony again, and they want to be on our side THE SIDE OF FREEDOM. 

what do you do? 

well the natives decide to exploit a long standing stereotype of being credulous and stupid. yes obviously we're maintaining this airstrip because it will bring heap big cargo from the magic white man with his great metal birds. mayhap one of those white-bird sailing ships with the iron nails will come back too, who knows?

yes this radio is made out of coconuts and is completely nonfunctional, nothing to see here, just us with our religious observations keeping the airstrip lit, you know, just in case some magic cargo were to drop down from the sky.

they get patted on the head, the CIA comes and goes with noone the wiser because if you say you saw a plane at the obviously-religious-airfield you sound like one of those native loonies.

|-| cnvvrb3 || 8 || That's the gist of it, yeah. I'm actually part aztec, so I took a liking to studying the culture when I was young. My grandmother actually told me a few stories of our ancestors and what we came to be.

The Azteca were a group native to the lands of Aztlan, an unknown land believed to have been in Northern Mexico. Sometime during pre-columbian history, the Azteca packed up and moved South - legend says it was at the behest of their war god, Huitzilopochtli (Hweet-tsi-loh-POCH-tlee). The stories say Huitzilopochtli commanded the Azteca to trek South toward a lake, and settle where the eagle landed upon the cactus rock to devour the snake. They reportedly saw such a scene on a chain of islands at Lake Texcoco,  what is now the valley of Mexico City. This became so popular, it made it's way onto the national Mexican flag, and the Azteca major city was named Tenochtitlan - *cactus rock*.

Aztecs were known for some relatively strange and often macabre religious practices. For one, when the Azteca encountered other Nahua (of which the Azteca were an offshoot) peoples along the way, they added whatever god that local group worshipped into their pantheon. It was a way of ensuring they didn't piss off any god by ignoring them. By the time they reached the Lake, they had dozens of deities - Tlaloc, god of the rain; Xipe Totec, god of the spring; Quetzalcoatl (my favorite, literally meaning *the feathered serpent*), god of knowledge - to name a few. But what was macabre about the Nahua was that *all* of them practiced different forms of religious sacrifice. You've probably heard of the practice of slitting the sacrifices throat and performing a very unnecessary cardiectomy - That was a sacrifice specific to the war god, Huitzilopochtli. You see, the Nahua believed the gods gave their life essence to create the world, the sun, and all life. They believed humanity owed them a debt that must be repayed. Blood must be shed everyday for the sun to continue to rise. These sacrifices were usually prisoners of war, a custom I will get to in a second. At the height of the Mexica sacrifices, seasonal festivals would be held where thousands would be sacrificed in mere weeks. Let me give you an example of how horrifying Aztec sacrifice could be. By the time they first arrived at Lake Texcoco (no longer exists; what is now the valley of mexico city), there were already several nahua tribes living in the area. The most powerful were the Culhuacan, living on the southern side of the lake and the Azcapotzalco on the west shore, who kicked the aztecs out of their territory. The aztecs were well recieved by the Culhuacan and were granted land nearby.

During a feast the aztec priests offered the ruler of the Culhuacan to make his daughter into a goddess. Unbeknownst to the ruler, the ritual to deify her involved skinning her alive. When the chief aztec priest proudly emerged during the feast, wearing his daughter like cloak, the king was horrified and banished the Aztecs.



 Aztec cultured was also deeply connected to war. Boys and men measured their honor by skill in battle. It was so intrinsic to their society that it was connected to their religion. The Aztecs must always be at war to ensure POWs could be sacrificed - do not fret, as I said before these captured Nahua also believed in sacrifice and considered it to be an honor. Even during peacetime, the Aztecs would arrange large battles with their allies so each side could take prisoners.

Aztec weaponry followed the pattern of it's wielders and was truly bitchin'. You might have heard of the Macuahuitl, an obsidian tipped wooden club designed to cut with devastating effect. Yes, it was tipped with obsidian. The volcanic rock could be found often due to the capital city's close proximity to a still active volcano. I'm not entirely sure, but I assume this is because of an absence of metal ores in the region.

The Macuahuitl was often NOT obsidian tipped, however, due to its deadly nature. A battlefield kill meant nothing to a warrior; Aztec religion stressed the need for sacrifices, so soldiers put their efforts into the *capture* of enemy soldiers. Not to say the obsidian didn't see action. It was oft' seen in combat and sacrifice. We liked to flay our victims sometimes and you can't exactly please Xipe Totec using a piece of wood.

Soldiers prided themselves on the number of warriors they could capture. In japanese culture, the topknot was a symbol of a true warrior; but in Aztec culture, it marked a rookie who had not yet captured three men. Once a warrior achieved this, he could remove his dreaded topknot.

Aztec soldiers were infamous in the Nahua culture and the Jaguar warrior was a deadly sight to see, but the macuahuitl was ineffective against metals. The macuahuitl obsidian shattered against the Spaniards' steel. |-|

|-| cnvxebf || 11 || Some background information -
Before WWI Germany had occupied the northern part of Eastern new Guinea while the southern part (Papua) was a British possession.  After WWI they were combined into Papua New Guinea and given (by the League of Nations) to Australia as an external territory with the aim of guiding it to independence (granted in 1975).  While Australia did set PNG up as a functioning independent nation it also exploited it (gold, copra, coffee etc).  The administration was run on a shoestring with little money being spent.  Come WWII Australia and the USA poured enormous resources into PNG to fight the Japanese who had occupied the country. The indigenous people began to get the idea that they had been exploited, so to get their share of the "cargo" they saw being delivered to the army, by parachute, they began to build ceremonial "airfields".  Often they set up a shrine to "John Frumm"a pilot.
After WWII, these cargo cults continued but often as a form of protest against the Australian administration's ungenerous policies, rather than as a form of magic.  Australian reaction was dismissive or patronising and even today politicians regularly criticise an opponents policies as a "cargo cult" if they appear to be unfunded promises.

&gt;The 1st United States Congress voted to pay Washington a salary of $25,000 a year—a large sum in 1789. Washington, despite facing financial troubles at the time, declined the salary, since he valued his image as a selfless public servant. At the urging of Congress, however, he ultimately accepted the payment, to avoid setting a precedent whereby the presidency would be perceived as limited only to independently wealthy individuals who could serve without any salary. The president, aware that everything he did set a precedent, attended carefully to the pomp and ceremony of office, making sure that the titles and trappings were suitably republican and never emulated European royal courts. To that end, he preferred the title "Mr. President" to the more majestic names proposed by the Senate. |-|

* Footnote: Orson Welles, Sigmund Freud, Charlie Chaplin, Mark Twain and a host of very literate people doubted Shakespeare's authorship of the plays. Orson Welles pointed out how the plays lined up with Edward de Vere's life. De Vere's family crest has a lion shaking spears, and in parliament he was called "Spear-Shaker". The boat that was lost in the play "The Tempest?" It was owned by Edward de Vere. While the guy from Stratford-on-Avon never left England, de Vere traveled extensively and lived in several of the cities the plays were set in. Hamlet quotes passages from a book that was not previously available in English, and was only recently translated by de Vere's father-in-law. De Vere was a writer, and known for his poems and plays. In fact, before the appearance of "Shake-spear's" plays [because that's how the name was originally written] de Vere was mentioned in a book as one of England's greatest poet/dramatists. Orson Welles comments, "If Edward de Vere didn't write the plays, you have to explain away a lot of funny coincidences." In other words, de Vere's life lines up far more convincingly with the content of the plays than the guy from Stratford-on-Avon.

&gt;916748676920039158098660927585380162483106680144308622407126516427934657040867096593279205767480806790022783016354924852380335745316935111903596577547340075681688305620821016129132845564805780158806771

As an experiment, start a timer and see how long it takes you to say this number aloud, let alone find the 23rd frigging root of it!! 

It's so incomprehensible to me that someone could process it so fast!

|-| cnx7ftv || 1969 || Wow. Clicking through the Wiki sources and found [this article](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mathematical-genius-shakuntala-devi-no-more/article4640134.ece?homepage=true), published a few days after her passing. 

&gt; “It is sad that her techniques to simplify math were not used by educational institutions,” said D.C. Shivdev, a trustee of the Shakuntala Devi Educational Foundation Public Trust. “She strove to simplify math for students and help them get over their math phobia. It is a pity that her techniques died with her.”

:( |-| 
|-| cnx7h02 || 41 || While her achievement seems superhuman, she has actually mastered a method of calculation which is thousands of years old called Vedic Math, which comes from the Upanishads. It is a method of organizing numbers in your mind and doing complex calculations which would otherwise be impossible. The reason she was able to calculate such a complex number is that she was able to split the problem into dozens or even hundreds of separate smaller simpler problems. An amazing skill.

Here is a small example

She picked random kids out, asked them to tell her their birth date and would proceed to tell them what day of the week they were born on, in like a couple of seconds. She even taught us some some simple maths shortcuts. I'll be damned if i remember any of them. I think I still have one of her books lying around. Absolute legend.

(1) Of the plays in the First Folio of 1623, all of which are universally conceded to be by the same man (although some may be inaccurate in places and may even occasionally show the work of another hand), fifteen were published as separate works in one or more editions during Shakespeare's lifetime; fourteen of these bear Shakespeare's name on the title page. The First Folio is entitled "Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies." No one else's name is associated with the quartos or folios, although Shakespeare's name was used by some unscrupulous publishers on the title pages of other plays which he did not write. In short, at the time of the publication of the First Folio, the plays were commonly believed to have been written by someone named William Shakespeare, whoever he might be.

(2) The company that produced Shakespeare's plays numbered among its members John Heminge (or Heminges), Henry Condell, Richard Burbage, and William Shakespeare. It was quite common in those times for men to bequeath sums of money to their friends for the purchase of "memorial rings." The William Shakespeare who died at Stratford-on-Avon in 1616 and was buried there in the Church of the Holy Trinity left in his will money for the purchase of memorial rings to Heminge, Condell, and Burbage. Common sense tells us that the Stratford Shakespeare was the partner of the other three in the theatre.

(3) During his lifetime Shakespeare was referred to specifically by name as a well-known writer at least twenty-three times, not counting the appearance of his name on title pages. The references range in time from 1595 (W. Covell's "All praise worthy Lucretia Sweet Shakespeare") to 1614 (when Sir Thomas Freeman praises the poet in a sonnet entitled "To Master William Shakespeare"). Among those who acknowledged Shakespeare as a poet or playwright during his lifetime were Richard Barnfield, Gabriel Harvey, William Drummond of Hawthornden, Sir John Davies, Edmund Howes (John Stow's successor as editor of the Annals) and, perhaps most significant of all, William Camden, the great teacher and antiquarian. After Shakespeare's death his greatest rival, Ben Jonson, not only commented on his poetry (including a specific reference to Julius Caesar) but also acknowledged that Shakespeare was a friend whom he admired "this side idolatry."

(4) In the most remarkable listing of Elizabethan works recorded by a contemporary, Francis Meres, a young clergyman who came up to London in the mid-1590's, in his Palladis Tamia (1598) mentions Shakespeare by name no less than nine times and as the author of twelve plays, two poems, and some sonnets.

(5) In 1623 appeared the First Folio, the title page of which has already been given. In addition to that, two facts are of interest to us: (i) that in a commendatory poem Ben Jonson referred to the author as "Sweet Swan of Avon"; (ii) that the volume was edited and published by John Heminge and Henry Condell, who tell us in a preface that they undertook the labor "only to keep the memory of so worthy a friend and fellow alive as was our Shakespeare." Common sense would suggest that the Shakespeare of whom they wrote was the one who left them money to buy memorial rings. Again, all the known evidence points to the Stratford Shakespeare as the writer of Hamlet, Macbeth, Henry V, and the other plays and poems that have kept the world at the author's knees for almost four hundred years.

(6) Equally important, in view of the foregoing five arguments, is the fact that none of the plays or poems is attributed to anyone but Shakespeare not only during his lifetime but for a century and a half after his death. No document of the period has been found which connects any other person directly with the plays or poems. All such claims have been thoroughly exploded, but in a brief paper of this kind it is not possible to consider them in detail. This will infuriate those anti-Stratfordians who feel that their own arguments have not been heeded. I must fall back on the same explanation given by H. N. Gibson in his valuable book, The Shakespeare Claimants: "It is hardly necessary to state that I cannot include in my survey every individual argument put forward by every individual theorist. Their very number makes any such idea absolutely impossible. Hundreds of books and pamphlets have been produced in the course of the controversy, and the literature of the Baconians alone would stock a fair-sized library. It is true that there is much repetition and overlapping in these works, but even so it would require several bulky volumes to review them all adequately."

He knew tables of logarithms and he could interpolate with unerring accuracy. Feynman's own mastery of calculating had taken a different path. He knew how to compute series and derive trigonometric functions, and how to visualize the relationships between them. He had mastered mental tricks covering the deeper landscape of algebraic analysis-differentiating and integrating equations of the kind that lurk dragonlike in the last chapters of calculus texts. He was continually put to the test. The theoretical division sometimes seemed like the information desk at a slightly exotic library."

|-| cnxduss || 3 || I'm seeing a lot of misconceptions about intelligence in this thread. 

1) We don't know for sure that she is a savant.  The term "savant" typically denotes someone who has a high degree of talent in one specific area,  with lower areas of aptitude in others. Although many Mental Calculators are savants, plenty of them are not savants and have average or above average intelligence. 

2) We really can't know for certain if she's necessarily *smarter*  than "insert genius/scientist/mathematician here" .  Intelligence is multifaceted and the so-called "IQs" of prodigies vary widely. As Scott Barry Kaufman noted, [Some prodigies have overall high global intelligence, while some of them have rather average cognitive skills](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/2014/02/10/the-mind-of-the-prodigy/). Some of them have such varied levels of skills that their IQ are somewhat misleading. 

3) The concept of intelligence itself is still not completely understood. What separates high intellect from high creativity? How is it possible for some "geniuses", that is,  people who function on a high academic and intellectual level,  to score below the higher thresholds (as was supposedly the case with Richard Feynman) ? How is it possible for the reverse to happen?

|-| cnxe5bf || 4 || &gt;In 1977, she wrote The World of Homosexuals, the first study of homosexuality in India. In the documentary For Straights Only, she says that her interest in the topic came out of her marriage to a homosexual man and subsequent desire to look at homosexuality more closely to understand it.

&gt;The book, considered "pioneering", features interviews with two young Indian homosexual men, a male couple in Canada seeking legal marriage, a temple priest who explains his views on homosexuality, and a review of the existing literature on homosexuality. It ends with a call for decriminalising homosexuality, and "full and complete acceptance—not tolerance and not sympathy". The book, however, went mostly unnoticed at the time.

She was really ahead of her time. |-|

|-| cnxeapa || 5 || Had an advanced math class when I was in middle school, and in said class, there was an autistic kid named Justin. He was pretty obviously autistic, but was actually a really cool kid. He wad in the class mainly due to the fact that he was faster than any calculator we could use anyways. Everyone thought that he just studied a lot,but I remember one day we were waiting to get let out from class when someone asked Justin what 69x69 was,kinda as a joke. Immediately, he answered 4,761. We checked the math and we're pretty impressed. over the next 15 mins, we learned just how UNGODLY GOOD Justin was at math. We were asking square roots of decimal numbers, ridiculous questions such as 6.396 cubed, and he would fire answers out like it was nothing. It absolutely blew our minds, especially being the 12/13 year Olds we were that he could do more than times tables above 12, let alone to the EXACT decimal place. Saw him a few years later, he got jacked and went to state for wrestling before he got kicked out for being pressured by a coach to use steroids :( |-|

The reason he died, was that for a month or so after, doctors were constantly probing his wound in an attempt to find and remove the bullet, and because of this (and the unsterile practices of the time) he succumbed to infection and died of sepsis  |-| 
|-| cnxf40u || 3 || if anyone is interested in how to do it, this is how: (going to take you way longer than 50 tho, I'm sure of it)
First you start  by setting your limits:
10^200 &lt;= x^23 &lt; 10^201 (Here the  equation states the x^23 should have 201 digits in the integers realm)

which gives you:
496194761&lt;=x&lt;=548441657
(which is a gap  of 52246896 numbers)
Now that you have both limits you need to interpolate starting for the first digit.
if it is a 1 then the number  is most likely close to 496194761 and if it is a 9 then it is most likely close to 548441657

The number it was given to her was: 
916748676920039158098660927585380162483106680144308622407126516427934657040867096593279205767480806

To keep it simple we can make it a linear guess  and start interpolating from there.
since the gap is 52246896 we should multiply it *0.916 (which is  the proximity of the 201 digit number to our limit) and then sum our lower limit 496194761

this gives us around: 544052918 (which is not the answer yet, but we are close)
now we check 544052918 ^ 23 is actually: 8312xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (a 201 number that starts with 8312)

then we take the average in between  our number and our upper limit and we get 546247288
we check 546247288 ^23 and we get : 9119xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (a 201 number that starts with 9119)

and we are getting even closer.

now we repeat with the  new average being 547344473
we  check it and we get:  9549xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (a 201 number that starts with 9549)

since we shot too far now we take the previous one and average it (546247288 + 547344473)/2
and we get 546795881

we check it again and we get: 9332xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (a 201 number that starts with 9332)

since we are still shooting too far  we now average with this one (546247288 + 546795881)/2
and we get 546521585

and we check again and now we are at 9225xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (a 201 number that starts with 9225)

we are awfully close by now, and the process is just to repeat this until we arrive to the solution which is: 546372891 

To do that many calculations so quickly it truly amazing. It took me around 10 minutes to write all this and did the calculations with the aid of a calculator (of course there are faster ways to solve this with the aid of a computer, but I broke it down to the thought process in basic operations)

The camps include supporters of the My Name is Earl of Oxford, Sir France Is Bacon, and Phillip Marlowe. 

Marlowe is recognized as in the very least as having been a huge influence on the works of Shakespeare if he weren't unfortunately dead when they were published.  He was the only candidate among the four that had a proven track record of writings in the same style. 

However if you like to believe that Marlowe was a secret agent of the Queen, faked his own death, and lived the rest of his life continuing the work he started in college, that image holds some romance to it. 

It's also curious to note that Marlowe had several of his plays "Published" posthumously on the same day as or very near to days that some of Shakespeare's works were published.

What the link doesn't mention is that the speech patterns that Shakespeare uses in his plays, far from impugning his authorship, are in fact among the strongest evidence for it. He uses many puns, botanical and animal references and general slang from Warwickshire, where he was born and raised, and continued to use them even after his success in the London stage. There's nothing inherently noble or learned about Shakespeare's language, and the details of law and foreign courts that he includes are often fanciful and sometimes simply invented. His is the work of an educated commoner, with an uncanny knack for observation, imitation and coaxing out the joyful euphony of English.  |-|

I myself prefer Woody Allen's [take](http://theoncominghope.blogspot.hu/2011/10/woody-allen-solves-shakespeare-mystery.html) on the subject:

"The most recent of these theories is to be found in a book I have just read that attempts to prove conclusively that the real author of Shakespeare's works was Christopher Marlowe. The book makes a very convincing case, and when I got through reading it I was not sure if Shakespeare was Marlowe or Marlowe was Shakespeare or what. I know this, I would not have cashed checks for either of them - and I like their work.

Now, in trying to keep the above mentioned theory in perspective, my first question is: if Marlowe wrote Shakespeare's works, who wrote Marlowe's? The answer to this lies in the fact that Shakespeare was married to a woman named Anne Hathaway. This we know to be factual. However, under the new theory, it is actually Marlowe who was married to Anne Hathaway, a match which caused Shakespeare no end of grief, as they would not let him in the house.

One fateful day, in a jealous rage over who held the lower number in a bakery, Marlowe was slain - slain or whisked away in disguise to avoid charges of heresy, a most serious crime punishable by slaying or whisking away or both.

It was at this point that Marlowe's young wife took up the pen and continued to write the plays and sonnets we all know and avoid today. " |-|

Television, with its giant wall screens, was the most dangerous thing in the book -- not the flames. The bad guys aren't the government censors, they are the people watching television. The fireman are just doing their jobs.

Its like the song "Video Killed the Radio Star" except this book could have been called "Video Killed the Books". |-| 
|-| cnxno4b || 18 || Then here's another neat car/jet fact you might never have heard of either. The US Airforce has a spy jet called the U2. It is very hard to see out of and difficult to land. So they use really fast cars to assist it. Last time I read an article about it was a ways back but they were using alot of Chevrolet stuff like G8's, GTO's and Camaro's that could keep up with the jet while it was landing.  |-|

Been using that name for first person shooters for nearly 15 years after some highschool buddies and I decided to make a CS clan named Lone Gunmen and named ourselves after presidential assassins. 

I remember everybody else wanted to be Oswald and I pounced on Guiteau for two reasons. Garfield died a slow, brutal, death due to complications from the wound and poorly practiced medicine. And the name just sounded cool. It also helped that the man was a kook.  |-|

We are spending millions upon millions of dollars tracking, monitoring when we should really only be worrying about probably 5% of that number. Even John Walsh admits that the registry is not being used as it was intended.  If we could re-direct the millions and put it towards mental health treatment and other perhaps addressing homelessness, we would be better off as a society.  Less than 5% of all sex offenses against kids are by a complete stranger.

from [NCIC's page on missing persons](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ncic/ncic-missing-person-and-unidentified-person-statistics-for-2013):

&gt;The Missing Person Circumstances (MPC) field is optional and has been available since July 1999 when the NCIC 2000 upgrade became operational.  Of the 627,911 records entered in 2013, the MPC field was utilized in 306,538 (48.8 %).  When the MPC field was utilized in 2013 entries, 293,684 (95.8 %) were coded as Runaway, 2,310 (0.8 %) as Abducted by Non-custodial Parent, 335 (0.1 %) as Abducted by Stranger, and 10,209 (3.3 %) as Adult – Federally required entry.  In 2012, the MPC field was utilized in 322,936 (48.8 %) of the 661,593 records.

|-| cnxrubo || 24 || As referenced on my favorite comedy podcast of late, [The Dollop](http://thedollop.libsyn.com/48-live-w-wil-anderson-charle-guiteau).

Garfield's assassin was certifiably insane -- he once gave a speech in front of a few dozen black people in Illinois and thought that he deserved the Ambassadorship to France for that action. He moved to Washington where he followed Garfield around and pestered anyone and everyone about securing his place in the administration (although he had backed the other faction in the primary).  When he wasn't awarded anything, he decided Garfield was an ineffectual president and to dispatch with him. 

Anyway, check out the podcast or the subreddit: /r/thedollop, it's honestly the funniest thing I've heard in a long time.

Excerpts from Bill Bryson's "One Summer",

"His ignorance was a frequent source of wonder. He believed that the Earth could not support the weight placed on it by skyscrapers and that eventually cities would collapse on themselves, as in some time of biblical apocalypse. He seldom let facts or logic challenge the certainty of his instincts" pg 230

and 

"Ford, it transpired, did not know much about anything. He could not say when the American Revolution was fought ("In 1812, I think ; I'm not quite sure") or quite what the issues were that provoked it. Questioned about politics, he conceded that he didnt follow matters closely and had voted only once in his life [for James Garfield]. It was quickly pointed out that Garfield was assinated three years before Ford reached voting age." pg 321

"Ford life and career [John Kenneth Galbraith] maintained, were "marked by obtuseness, stupidity, and in consequence, by a congeries of terrible errors"" pg 232

He was so racist Hitler praised him in Mein Kampf. who kept a framed photo of Ford on his wall and awarded him the Grand Cross of the German Eagle, Nazi Germany's highest civilian honor.

And he poured millions of dollars into "Fordlandia" a Christian society of workers the size of Connecticut, mining rubber trees in Brazil which was a spectacular failure.

|-| cnxz5sz || 8 || This makes a situation I had happen to me as a kid even weirder.

I was like, 10. I was out in my driveway shooting some basketball, and a typical kidnapper van (old as fuck, lacking plates, no windows) pulls into my driveway. Now, I had never seen this van and I lived towards the end of a dead end street. Some total creep opened the passenger door and told me that "he had to deliver some money down the street, but he couldn't do it personally. If I rode with him and dropped it off, he'd give me some". 

This is where all the "stranger danger" stuff they taught us as kids kicked in cause there was alarms going off in my head screaming "fuuuuuuuck no". I told him that I needed to ask my parents first, so that he wouldn't get spooked and try to grab me. He then asked if there was any other kids in the neighborhood who would do it, so I sprinted into the house and went straight to my dad. The guy peeled out of my driveway. We filed a police report, but I don't think he was ever arrested for questioning (at least not in my small town).

The kicker was, a few months earlier, my mom had set me up for a staged fake kidnapping so that I could be filmed as part of a PSA (my mom worked in PR for the PD of the larger city we lived outside of). It was meant to be realistic, but I kind of knew as it was happening but I played a long anyway. I thought the other incident with the van was a more realistic simulation, because all of the uneasiness and tension and fear was rule. 

My mother was beside herself when she learned about the guy in the van, and the police involvement was very much real. I think, though, that the simulation is what kept me safe the second time though, as it was enough of a refresher to make those alarms go off in my head. Looking back I have no doubt about what would have happened if I had gotten in that van, and I'm glad for all the stranger danger training I got in school.

Tl;Dr: stranger danger can be very real. I was once a part of both a simulated kidnapping and a very real attempted kidnapping from right outside my house as a kid. |-|

During the shift report we suddenly realized that we had put two men in the same room who both thought they were Jesus (it's pretty much the most popular delusion, so it wasn't unusual to have a couple of Messiahs around). 

We went pale. Competing delusions can turn very ugly. A couple of us raced to the room and peeked in. The two men were deep in conversation with a Bible open, but they were smiling and didn't seem too tense. We tiptoed away and decided to just keep an eye on things.

About a half hour later, they emerged to announce that they had discussed the matter, prayed a bit, re-read some parts of the New Testament, and had come to the conclusion that Jesus B was the True Messiah, and Jesus A was actually John the Baptist.

Didn't have a single problem with them, and the two actually remained fast friends as they got back on their meds and recovered. |-|

|-| co96r4v || 319 || Author of the article here. I bring trivia! 

1) More than any other article I've written I struggled while deciding on the title for this one. I was torn between:

* We Three Kings of Kings
* To Undo Others (I ended up using this in the main graphic, but it's only visible in certain window sizes)
* The Unholy Trinity
* Three Thrown Over the Cuckoo's Nest (I finally settled on this one)

2) The building in the background of the [stained glass image](http://cdn.damninteresting.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/stained-large-3.jpg) is modeled after the actual [Ypsilanti State Hospital](http://i.imgur.com/rVyXNmJ.jpg) building.

3) There are actually four Jesuses in the stained glass image...the right-most Jesus is leaning on a portion of the [botched Ecce Homo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecce_Homo_%28El%C3%ADas_Garc%C3%ADa_Mart%C3%ADnez%29).

4) Our server is weeping openly as I type this, you monsters.

I hope that was as much fun for you to read as it was for me to type.

Leon explained away the others' assertions as lies from attention-seeking imposters, or the result of technical-sounding nonsense terms such as "duping", "interferences", or "electronic imposition". As for Joseph, he sagely observed that the other Christ claimants were, in fact, patients in a mental hospital, which proved that they were quite insane. |-|

|-| co972t1 || 5 || I once worked in a psychiatric hospital in Independence, Missouri.  We had a guy there who was in four point restraint crying for us to free him as he was Jesus.  His history was one of barfights, so he wasn't too believable in his role.  But, we did get a guy in who had just arrived the day before from California.  He told me he had found a line in the Bible that convinced him that he was Jesus Christ returned.  He went around on the street there proclaiming this.  A mormon struck up a conversation with him and pointed out that he could not be the Return, as it is promised in the Mormon faith that Christ will return first in Independence, Missouri, the sacred home of Mormons  (This was actually a Mormon psychiatric hospital located in that community which occasionally performed Mormon exorcisms when psychiatric medicine did not work, but that is another story).  Anyway, this guy comes in on a bus, having sold all his possessions for the trip from L.A.  He stays overnight in a hotel so he can announce his Return the next morning at the Mormon temple.   Which he does dressed only in the red bedspread of the motel bed.  He makes his appearance only to be told that he is at the wrong temple, Mormons it seems have a schizm so that there are now two competing temples waiting for the return.  So, he makes his way, close by, to the other temple.  They, apparently not as snarky as the guys across the street, called the police.  Which is how he came to be in the intake chair across from me.  Well, you can imagine he was a pissed Jesus.  On that very afternoon we had had three min-itornadoes spinning around the area, no major damage, but he claimed the tornadoes were a maninfestation of his anger.  Did I mention that he was in his mid-twenties and about six feet seven inches tall with an athelete's body.   I thought it best to walk gingerly around his apparent delusion, far be it from me to tell him he is not Jesus.  Instead, I told him we had a patient there who also thought he was Jesus and that I was confused.  Who was the real Jesus?  He became excited and wanted to see the other patient right then.  So, I led him over to the room where the guy lay in his restraints, late twenties, average looking, even if a bit banged up from his bar fights, and said, Jesus, this is Jesus.  It grew very quiet in the room, but the energy was palpable.  I didn't know whether to expect absolute bedlam and carnage (as two Jesus's can't exist in the same time and same place and they would rush to annihalate each other, and if so, my money was on the Jesus not in restraints) or a miracle cure where they would both say, "hey, what was I thinking?"  Instead, out of this quiet vibe filled environment, they both smiled and looked at each other, embraced and proclaimed that they were both Jesus.  They were beaming and ecstatic.  I  felt bad not being a Jesus, like somehow everything had flipped and I was the crazy person for not embracing my own "inner Jesus". 
 
Anyway, the guy in the restraints escaped that night.  He smeared his feces on his wrist and ankles to slide out of the restraints and then out a wired closed window (as in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's' Nest).  The other Jesus was convinced that this was evidence of his miraculous nature.  

In time, he and I talked about the as-if quality of being filled with Jesus as opposed to actually claiming to be the one.  After all, he had already met another.  It must be some kind of shared thing...and if it was shared by all, then maybe he wasn't so special after all.  
It was this thinking that got him out of the hospital and back on his way to California and his family.  The Jesus escape artist was never heard from again.  |-|

I remember seeing a show years ago where Julia Roberts was talking about her.  She said they were filming some movie together (Steel Magnolia's, I think) and it was really hot and they had been filming all day so everyone was complaining about being hot and tired, except Dolly.  When she asked Dolly if she was hot and tired and why she was the only one not complaining, Dolly said that growing up all she wanted was to sing and be in movies and now that she does, she doesn't complain because she's been in worse situations.

Humble, talented, and filthy rich because she is an excellent business woman. |-| 
|-| co9ikyv || 107 || I love Dolly. She's one of my personal heroes. She has a beautiful voice, *serious* songwriting chops, a top-notch sense of humor, and truly cares about her fellow humans. Everyone should be more like Dolly Parton. |-| 
|-| co9j39h || 100 || My dad does a ton of work for this charity in Florida, as well as volunteering for reading programs for kids from toddlers to middle school.

He was a Public Defender for close to 40 years, and in a relatively small county like I grew up in, he'd sometimes have three generations of the same family as clients for things like larceny or possession. Sometimes he'd have the 4th or 5th generation of felons in his office, whose family had been represented by his predecessors in the 1960s or '70s.

What he noticed, though, was the families that didn't find themselves in that cycle had a common factor: The parents, after their sentence was up, made an effort to get involved in the education of their kids. Maybe they couldn't control what schools their kids went to and maybe they weren't even educated enough to help with homework, but they would make an effort to encourage their children to be better.

The most effective way to help the kids was reading. The kids who learned to read had better vocabularies, which meant they were better at communicating with peers and adults. They had an expanded worldview from the stories they read, even simple kids' books, and knew how to empathize. 

What surprised him was that *it didn't matter what the kids were reading*. Books, comics, blogs, magazines... as long as they were reading *with their parents* they had a phenomenally lower recidivism rate.

Imagination Library is his favorite national charity because it puts books directly into the hands of kids of all ages and incomes. In his eyes it's the #1 resource to putting State/District Attorneys and Public Defenders out of a job, which would be an awesome thing to achieve. |-| 
|-| co9gpqi || 275 || I just wanna say Dolly Parton is awesome. Country musicians tend to get a bad rap, but I really wanna say she's super far from the stereotype.

Super friendly, super caring, even a big backer of gay rights. Also she once did a movie that was basically My Fair Lady, only instead of an upper class englishman she was a country star, and Stallone was... ...Stallone. And she made a bet that she could turn him into a proper country star. I'm not joking, this exists. Rhinestone. It's hilarious. |-|

|-| co9kgym || 3 || She came from such humble beginnings. Go to her theme park called Dollywood in Tennessee and you can learn all about her life, she is such an inspiration. I don't care what some other people may think, I love Dolly Parton!  |-| 
|-| co9kh18 || 3 || My kids look forward to this every month. I love it! Books are a huge part of our children's lives, but they can get pretty expensive, quick! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PROGRAM!!! |-| 
|-| co9kmhz || 3 || Both of my kids are in this program, and it's a highlight of the their month. |-| 
|-| co9kn0m || 3 || That's gotta' be a rough fifth birthday.

"Dolly's cuttin' you off, Timmy." |-| 
|-| co9kpky || 3 || I'm not a country fan at all, but she honestly seems like one of the down-to-earth people you could happen to meet.  I think one her most famous quotes is "It takes a lot of money to look this cheap". |-| 
|-| co9kshu || 3 || And she has an incredible amusement park too! |-| 
|-| co9ku80 || 3 || I think that this is awesome. My Lil guy is apart of the program and it is awesome. |-| 
|-| co9l7s0 || 3 || Listening to the local tribal radio station the other day, I got to hear about a Preschool teacher say that one of her students, a 4-5 year old kid told her, "I wish my parents would read to me but they're just always on their phones." Sad times indeed. |-| 
|-| co9lexd || 3 || Her guitarist actually owns a studio right down the road from my house, were she cut her last album and a couple others. My roommate happens to work there full time. Based on everything I've been told by my roommate, *she is a very charitable women with humble begginings*. I'm honestly not suprised. The country music community is amazing.  |-| 
|-| co9lkvh || 3 || She is an AMAZING woman! She grew up dirt poor and so now she likes to share her wealth with everyone to help them out. There is a college in Knoxville, TN that she bought and she pays full scholarship for everyone who goes there. There are many other stories of great things she has done. |-| 
|-| co9ln1p || 3 || They are good quality books and my kid's would get excited cause they thought Dolly Parton was personally sending them something in the mail. |-| 
|-| co9lxob || 4 || My son has been a benefactor of the program. They give you a firm to sign up for it at the hospital after birth. We did and it has been awesome. 

The books are also legit books. Nothing random. I remember after we moved within the state, after changing our address on the site for the free books, we were picking up our back log of books that we had missed due to the move and the lady handing us the book noticed one of them was her favorite from childhood. They're quality hard back ones too at times. 

I'm a Dolliever? Is that a thing. It's a thing now.   |-| 
|-| co9lylz || 3 || I donated a really young aged star wars book to this, so who is the real hero? |-| 
|-| co9m43o || 3 || I always associate Dolly with math. When I was in elementary learning about fractions, my teacher would call them a Dolly Parton when the numerator was bigger than the denominator. 

We had substitute teacher one day and we were going over fractions and I raised my hand and said that it was a Dolly Parton. I got kicked out of class but then had to explain to her that is what our teacher calls them. |-| 
|-| co9m4wp || 3 || Well that changed my opinion of her completely |-| 
|-| co9m5sg || 3 || Yup. My kid gets one every month. You can sign up for it in the hospital right after they're born.  |-| 
|-| co9mt07 || 3 || She's amazing. She is one of the most fantastic entertainers I've ever seen - she's plays like 8 instruments on stage. She's an incredible human in my opinion.  |-| 
|-| co9n6la || 3 || This will be buried deep in the comments now, but the previous owners of my house apparently subscribed to this program for their kid. Now I get children's books mailed to me every month and just donate them. After reading them, of course, haha.  |-| 
|-| co9no9h || 3 || TIL Dolly Parton is pretty alright by me.  |-| 
|-| co9nv43 || 3 || Among the littlest known secrets ever: there exist amazing human beings like Dolly Parton who consistently just make the world a little better because they can. Let's keep recognizing and celebrating those people. |-| 
|-| co9nyeb || 3 || What is age appropriate for a 1 month old |-| 
|-| co9pn3o || 4 || Dolly Parton is a badass. If I remember right, her original manager exploited her talents for years before she went off on her own and made millions. Instead of reveling in her managers ongoing failure after her departure she bought him out helping him in the process. She was never bitter or angry about it which is almost unheard of in the music industry. This lady definitely has a front row seat on my apocalypse spaceship, not that I have one, just a metaphor that she represents the best of humanity.  |-| 
|-| co9qbf2 || 4 || ITT: childless permavirgins.

Kids under 5 love being read to for a number of reasons. They don't have to be able to read to enjoy a book. |-| 
|-| co9qbti || 4 || Pretty cool experiences with Dolly Parton and her interactions with the public.  I would always ask my dad,who was a Captain at American Airlines, if he met anyone famous and what were they like. 
His best story was always about Dolly Parton and how she would interact with the crew and passengers. 
Just before the food and drink service would start, Dolly would ask the flight attendants, if they had an extra apron to use and if it would be OK if she helped with the drink service for the passengers. 
Pretty cool to always keep your foundations and pass joy onto others!

|-| co9j6eb || 5 || They should call her lil darling Parton cause she's so precious. She's a dwarfy lady with a squeaky voice and huge tracks of boobs, but she has a heart of gold.

|-| co9pdnw || 3 || I've done this for both my children and it's a wonderful program  |-| 
|-| co9plhk || 3 || Damn, wish I had known this before my daughter turned 5. I would have been all over that. |-| 
|-| co9q5sg || 3 || My daughter was in this when she was younger. Got mailed books for free. My daughter finished up her 5th grade year reading at a 12th grade level. Cant say this was solely responsible but it didn't hurt. Thats why I had no qualms when my wife wanted us to go to Dollywood. I figure putting a bit of money back in this ladies pocket is not a bad thing.  |-| 
|-| co9q74i || 3 || growing up in east tennessee with a season pass to dolly wood, later in life working on her home, meeting her and her husband.  She's a wonderful person with a heart of gold. |-|

|-| co9jm29 || 6 || I love this woman. Not a fan of country music,Dollywood, or the south in general but I cannot find a single fault with this woman. Very positive, very giving, very loving. She is a wonderful human being.  |-| 
|-| co9ipvl || 3 || My son gets these books!!! I really love it he is about to turn two and the book we got this month is called the mineosaur. It's so fitting since he has been acting like a little terror lately. |-| 
|-| co9iyrb || 4 || Dolly's imagination library is awesome. We have been receiving books from her for a while.

Also, the 8" record of her recording of Jolene played at 33rpm is awesome.

|-| co8tqhs || 84 || Anyone who was in a band in high school knows the answer to this.

See, every band practice requires that you load your equipment, drive to your drummer's house (because his mother is the only one who won't complain about the noise), *unload* your equipment, set everything up, and then play about eight minutes' worth of music. More often than not, you'd end up stopping in the middle of a song - usually around the time that the lead guitarist got carried away - and then having a well-deserved snack whilst watching whatever episode of "The Kids in the Hall" the bassist had downloaded the night before.

Once all the food had been eaten and the episode was over, you'd play for *another* eight minutes or so, usually resuming practice right where you'd left off so that the lead guitarist could finish showing you the solo he'd "written." |-|

|-| co95sqm || 34 || This isn't entirely clear to me. Because both plastic and glass will be at the same temp, right? But is it that glass has a higher specific heat, so once it's at the "drying temp" it has enough energy to evaporate all the water on its surface? While at the same temp, because it has a lower specific heat, plastic doesn't have enough energy? So some water evaporates, but that sucks so much heat out of the plastic, that its temp drops below the threshold for further evaporation?


If that's the case, than doesn't it just mean that my dishwasher doesn't stay warm long enough to dry plastic? I mean, if there was a hairdryer in there, it would dry off the plastic eventually, right? |-|

|-| co9kp6p || 3 || &gt; And because the plastic dish is cooler, water is more likely to condense on its surface than on the hotter surface of the ceramic or glass dish.

This, though, isn't quite right.

They were doing very well with separating "heat" from "temperature" up until then, and then they failed.

The plastic will, of course, have the same temperature as anything else in the dishwasher, at the moment the rinse cycle stops.

Then the plastic will cool down at the same rate as the ambient temperature of the dishwasher in general + general cooling from evaporating water.

It won't cool down enough that water starts condensing on it, though - that would require them to leach heat to the outside of the dishwasher. |-|

Anyway, he thought initially that Challenger exploded and they all died right away. But then they discovered that it wasn't an explosion. Unbalanced drag had torn the stack apart and the "smoke" was actually just cryogenic fuel released into the atmosphere.

A pilot had pulled a spring loaded switch out of position. The switch couldn't have moved as a result of the crash because it had to be pulled out before it could be moved. The switch was to switch to backup power so he surmised that the pilot was trying to fly the Shuttle even after what he knew was a catastrophic event.

Furthermore, the astronauts each wore a personal air supply. However, it had to be manually activated from the back. Three astronauts had theirs activated. One astronaut could not have turned his on himself given where he sat and where the valve was. Either Resnick or McNair Hasbro have leaned over to turn on his air supply. 

Mullane thought that he only wished that he could be so disciplined in a tragedy. Even when you knew it was a lost cause, an astronaut falling to his or her death still had the presence of mind to turn on another guys air supply just to give him a better chance to live.  |-| 
|-| co91424 || 67 || "At T+72.284 the shuttle had a sudden acceleration.  Immediately afterwards came the last communication from the shuttle, when Pilot Michael J. Smith said “Uh-oh.”  Seconds later, the shuttle disintegrated."

I know this is slightly poor taste and was a terrible tragedy.  But I laughed a little bit at the thought that the last transmission was "uh-oh."

Pretty significant understatement. |-|

|-| co8wvf2 || -56 || True story but my Art teacher in High School may have inadvertently caused this disaster. 30 years ago he was a very successful artist and worked for Marvel comics for a time as well as various different corporations. He actually designed the Staples logo which they still use today. Anyways so NASA started taking applications for an art teacher to be part of the crew and he submitted his application not thinking much of it. Turns out about a month later he was contacted by a NASA representative and informed he had been selected.
He agreed to take part in the mission and he was almost at the training phase of the mission when he ultimately decided to pass because his wife was pregnant and her due date was slightly before the shuttle was to launch. So NASA had to spend extra time trying to find another willing astronaut teacher to launch into space.
This is where it gets interesting. According to him this factored in to the launch being delayed a month or two and finally being rescheduled into mid-january. According to him the cooler temperatures at launch caused parts of the fuel tank to become brittle and break up and tragically kill all of the astronauts. He blames himself for it to this day.
TL;DR my high school art teacher blames himself for the challenger disaster |-|

|-| co8ya2z || 10 || Almost all of the anecdotes about Nero are believed to be apocryphal by historians. |-| 
|-| co93kw3 || 9 || Almost all the history we have of Nero comes to us second hand or through his political opponents.  Accusations of wildly improper behavior, homosexuality, cowardice, and insanity were pretty common character smears in those times as now.  The idea of purely impartial academic history was not really valued the same way that it is today.  If all we knew about Caesar came from a few of his contemporaries, we'd think he spent most of his early  career getting buggered by Greek King Nicomedes.  Suetonius despised Nero, and that's probably why we think of him as we do.  He most likely did not rape vestal virgins, his own mother, and all his slaves.  Suetonius' account of Nero basically reads like a list of "things that would most offend contemporary roman culture".  He was a client of Hadrian, a member a different dynasty with a vested interest in legitimizing Nero.
 
We know almost nothing for sure about what Nero's reign was actually like.  The few contemporary sources do not mention any craziness and seem to view him fairly positively. |-|

|-| co9ljg7 || 6 || The entire diamond engagement ring thing is a marketing ploy by De Beers. It has only been a thing for about 75 years or so. Diamonds are practically worthless if it weren't for the De Beer monopoly on them. They buy nearly the entire world supply of mined diamonds and then sequester them in warehouses and only release a small portion on to the market. If all the diamonds mined every year were sold openly, diamonds would be worth pennies on the dollar. Buying and wearing diamonds demonstrates that you are just a sucker for a clever marketing campaign.  |-|

&amp;gt;So back when I was just a young adult (early 80s) I got my first job as a pizza delivery man. I get an order for a large pizza and a few bottles of coke. The drive seemed like forever since it was in upstate and my heat didn't work in that winter night. I finally make it and hope the pizza isn't cold by then since I really needed the tip money.

&amp;gt;I knocked on the door. No answer. I was freezing, yet determined to deliver the pizza. I knock again and finally an answer. It was an older guy and I could tell that he probably just got done with a doobie. The smell was obvious, but I smoked at the time too so I didn't think too much of it.

&amp;gt;The man had forgotten his cash and told me to come in and warm up while he found his check book. He left away to another room while I warmed in the front hallway. That's when it hit me. I knew this guy. He was famous for something and I saw him on TV all of the time. I'm trying to remember what show I've seen him from and can't even think of it by the time he gets back. His face looked less happy than when I first came and he said, "I'm so sorry that I cannot find my checkbook at the moment. I know you've driven a long way and I want to pay you. How about you sit down for a bit, have some pizza and I can pay you with something more valuable than any amount of money. I can give you knowledge."

&amp;gt;That's when I figured it out. That man was Carl Sagan from that PBS show The Cosmos.

per mod sticky |-| 
|-| co9ialt || 5 || Federal jobs are often in Big Cities (most notably DC) where working class whites have fled to ex-burbs.  They were priced out of decent white neighborhoods full of professionals, and fled when middle class blacks started moving into cheaper suburbs.  Instead of moving to where property was affordable in black or immigrant neighborhoods, they moved further and further out.  So the low level federal jobs, i.e. clerical, secretarial, etc. that are mostly in the center of the city are almost all black, while management is mostly still white.  No one is going to commute 4 hours round trip for a $30K clerical job.

TL; DR: More fed black employees because working class white folks don't want to live in black neighborhoods.     |-| 
|-| co9pydw || 3 || You shouldn't jam two statistics like that together. 

http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk

&gt;2744931 total fed jobs for civies 

So 17.8% is 488597.7. 

http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/pdf/cb13-ff02_black_history.pdf

&gt;43.9 million black people 

So 488597.7 out of 43.9 million is 1.1%. So 1.1% of civilian blacks hold a federal government job. 

The stats put together make it sound like there's a ton of black people with federal jobs. But that's not really the case. And it's 10.1% of the *private* sector. Obviously if they made up 10.1% of the total work force, they couldn't represent a higher percentage in *part* of the total work force. Just like 1/3 of a cake can't make up 2/3 of the same cake. 

10.1% of 43.9 million minus the 488597.7 is 4384551.6. So there's more blacks in the private labor force than federal labor force according to the numbers presented by the article and census.

Bassist Jeff Ament said, "I know it was a great song all along, and I felt that it was the best song that we got the worst take of on the first record. There were a hundred takes on that song, and we just never nailed it."[2] Drummer Dave Krusen said, "I was pretty green back then and 'Even Flow' suffered from too much fluctuation." He added that "it was really tough for me. I don't know why. Not sure why we didn't use that one from the demo as well, but I know it felt better."[3] Guitarist Mike McCready stated, "We did 'Even Flow' about 50, 70 times. I swear to God it was a nightmare.

TL;DR: "D0g....................." is stronger than "PrXyc.N(n4k77#L!eVdAfp9" because they are of similar complexity, even though D0g..................... has less entropy in the traditional sense.

What's important is that both use at least one capital letter, lowercase letter, and symbol.  While it's true that "correct horse battery staple" will eventually be found by a dictionary attack, (it's still stronger than almost any short string, but that's beside the point) if it was "c0rrect hOrse b@ttery s+aple" it would be nearly impossible to crack, even with a dictionary. |-|

|-| cob4ma7 || 1347 || I actually talked to someone working on a project researching dolphin communication. 

From what they said, Dolphins do have unique names, and their syntactical structure starts with something like, [my name] [your name] [message]. So not only do they know who they're talking to, but they should know that they're the ones being talked to.

Edit: I've gotten a number of questions, and I wish I could answer your curiousity, but truth be, I'm not really familiar with the project's methodology or all of it's findings. This was just a tidbit I remember from a brief conversation with a guy that worked with the them. I remember thinking how cool it was that Dolphins had their own syntax, but I'm not certain I even remembered that correctly as, as some have pointed out, it would make more sense if the sender and recipient signals were inverted in the syntax.

What I can tell you though, is that it's called The Wild Dolphin Project, it's headed by a woman named Denise Herzing, and she has a TedX talk that might illumine you further. |-| 
|-| cob32vc || 283 || I read somewhere that Dolphins have individual names, so they can introduce themselves or even reference a third dolphin who isn't present.

Blue-Collar Man: Dominick Bambino's.

Dante: Based on personal politics.

Blue-Collar Man: Right. And that week, the Foresci family put a hit on Babyface's house. My friend was shot and killed. He wasn't even finished shingling.

Randal: No way!

Blue-Collar Man: (paying for coffee) I'm alive because I knew there were risks involved taking on that particular client. My friend wasn't so lucky.

DANTE: There's more?

RANDAL: So they build another Death Star, right?

DANTE: Yeah.

RANDAL: Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.

DANTE: Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.				

RANDAL: And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.

DANTE: Compliments of Lando Calrissian.

RANDAL: Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.

DANTE: And you figured it out?

RANDAL: Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries - the only people on board were	Imperials.

DANTE: Basically.

RANDAL: So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.

DANTE: And the second time around...?

RANDAL: The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.

DANTE: So?

RANDAL: A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were 	independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.

DANTE: Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.

RANDAL: Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do	you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main? All they know is killing and white uniforms.

DANTE: All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?

RANDAL: All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed-
casualties of a war they had	nothing to do with. All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government		contract, which means all sorts of	benefits. All of a sudden these
left-wing militants blast you with 	lasers and wipe out everyone within
a three-mile radius. You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living.

The next week, an iceberg put a hit on Andrews' boat. My friend was drowned and killed. Didn't even finish playing the song. I'm alive because I knew the risk involved in that particular client.

Workers' Comp. favors the Employer, just as much as the Employee (Claimant).

(with less money and litigation costs) than risk a full scale trial in a tort action (with pain and suffering damages and more involve trial).

i thought tortoises are the tortoises of the animal kingdom? |-| 
|-| cobmx4w || 1645 || &gt; “We can run in conditions that no other animal can run in,” Lieberman said.

&gt;While animals get rid of excess heat by panting, **they can’t pant when they gallop**, Lieberman said. That means that to run a prey animal into the ground, ancient humans didn’t have to run further than the animal could trot and didn’t have to run faster than the animal could gallop. All they had to do is to run faster, for longer periods of time, than the slowest speed at which the animal started to gallop.

I actually never knew this, it is quite surprising.  |-| 
|-| cobo3yf || 582 || Early ([and some current](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826HMLoiE_o)) humans hunted by outrunning their prey over vast distances. This is called persistence hunting. Bipedal travel offers greater energy efficiency over long distance, as opposed to Quadripedal travel. Quadripedal travel offers greater speed and acceleration, this is the reason most animals chase their prey - they are faster.   

For example, a dog at full sprint can match or exceed the speed of most humans at full sprint - and they can run like this for up to around 15 minutes, before having to return to a trot averaging 3.8meters a second. A run-of-the-mill human jogger can average between 3.2-4.2m/s, where elite runners can average ~6.5m/s. This means you can most likely out run a dog over a distance of around 2kms.

Humans have the ability to carry water with them, so where an animal (such as an antelope) may overheat and dehydrate a human can carry on running. Humans can then catch up to their exhausted prey and kill it without much effort (if it's not already dead from exhaustion). 

It can be logically deduced that this is a factor why humans have evolved greater cognitive function as a beneficial trait - an antelope can out run a human and be lost from sight, but a smart human can follow the signs of where the antelope went. This progressed to smart humans developing traps and therefore increasing the probability of survival - and so on. 

In areas where this is still a fairly recent, or current, technique our greatest long distance runners hail. |-|

It expands on the points made and really convinces you that this is what our bodies were meant to do. |-|

|-| cobtmqt || 51 || The title that the poster posted on this article is inaccurate. At no point in the article does it say that, because it isn't true. Humans are built for endurance running. However, they can not outrun animals like Horses and Dogs in endurance contests. 

&gt;While animals get rid of excess heat by panting, they can’t pant when they gallop, Lieberman said. That means that to run a prey animal into the ground, ancient humans didn’t have to run further than the animal could trot and didn’t have to run faster than the animal could gallop. All they had to do is to run faster, for longer periods of time, than the slowest speed at which the animal started to gallop

However, dogs also have physiological advantages in running. From wikipedia. 

"Dogs possess a rete mirabile, a complex system of intermingled small arteries and veins, in the carotid sinus at the base of their neck.[25] This acts to thermally isolate the head, which contains the brain, the most temperature-sensitive organ, from the body, which contains the muscles, where most of the heat is generated. The result is that dogs can sustain intense physical exertion over a prolonged time in a hot environment, compared to animals which lack this apparatus; thus, a dog chasing a jackrabbit through the desert may not be able to outrun the rabbit, but it can continue the chase until the rabbit slows due to overheating.
Dogs and other canids also possess a very well-developed set of nasal turbinates, an elaborate set of bones and associated soft-tissue structures (including arteries and veins) in the nasal cavities.[26] These turbinates allow for heat exchange between small arteries and veins on their maxilloturbinate surfaces (the surfaces of turbinates positioned on maxilla bone) in a counter-current heat-exchange system.[26"

So my country could become a nuclear power if the UK gets knocked out? |-| 
|-| cobsp9x || 17 || Submarine communication is actually quite interesting, because it's limited by the laws of physics and electromagnetic skin depth of sea water. The upshot is that you can't just call them up when they're submerged, and you're limited to really low transfer speeds. If they surface to communicate, they're vulnerable. So you still have odd ways of communicating. Audio communications with a submerged sub that doesn't want to reveal its location isn't possible.  |-|

|-| cobvldh || 8 || Soviet attempts to fake Radio 4 broadcasts failed when they were unable to understand the rules to "I'm sorry I haven't a clue" |-| 
|-| cobvee4 || 7 || To be more exact than Wikipedia the test was to see if "The Today Programme" was broadcasting and it had to be down for three consecutive days (to allow for strikes, power cuts, technical problems etc.).  After that the submarine Captain would then look for other evidence of the world being destroyed eg. The American "happy signal" and British "Numbers Stations" being turned off, not being able to contact the land.  

After that he would then open his safe and open the letter from the Prime Minister telling him what to do.  Eash letter was written when the PM took office and could be updated during their time in office, they were sealed and destroyed when replaced.  So nobody knows what was in them but they were probably one of the following:

1) Strike Russia independently then proceed to Canada or Australia.

2) Attempt to contact US Navy and take instructions from them, if that fails strike Russia.

3) Do nothing head for Australia or Canada.

|-| cob7lol || 120 || Loyola University of New Orleans checking in. The Louisiana Civil code also borrows from many other civil code systems. The Spanish code is also very relevant because Spain ruled Louisiana for a short while. Some code articles are also a direct copy of the Justinian Code. However, Louisiana is what is known as a mixed jurisdiction because we use elements of both common and civil law. I am a civil law student myself, and history is a huge part of our curriculum because understanding judicial intent and the history of the code gives greater insight into what the drafters intended. This is why there is an argument that we do not even have a code technically, but a digest because the notations in the code itself play a large role in what the articles mean. If you want to learn more about this you can read The Death of a Code -- The Birth of a Digest by Vernon Palmer. |-| 
|-| cob73md || 31 || Our Civil Law system is actually more complicated than this. It was crafted from scratch by the legal scholars of the time when Louisiana was made an official State. It was heavily inspired by French, Spanish, and Roman law. The French and Spanish inspirations are well known, but almost no one outside of Louisiana talks about the Roman sources from which we take. Today though, many of our current laws are nearly identical to our common law neighbors. We do still have many legal philosophies and special terms that heavily influenced by the Civil Codes from which we draw inspiration. I believe we are the only state with forced heirship, which I believe is a Napoleonic-era idea (I might be wrong about the era from which it comes) that is our way of fighting against primogeniture traditions. Our marriage laws are Spanish though, in La married couples split the community property 50/50, although each member may have separate property as well that is left relatively untouched. An interesting note though, because of our state culture, we're pretty much the only state where lawyers and judges pronounce the latin and french legal terms correctly on the regular.

|-| cobav8d || 73 || My family is Polish and I have a number of relatives who died at the hands of Germans during the second world war. My mother was a teen at the time. In her memoirs she tells of Germans soldiers who saved her and her family members from the Gestapo. My understanding is that there was a vast difference between the German soldiers - who had a soldiers's code of honor - and the Gestapo and SS who were essentially thugs. She also talks of Jewish nazi collaborators at a time when she was almost sent to a death camp from Krakow.  It was much more complex than it's been portrayed. |-| 
|-| cobe2s8 || 7 || My great grandparents emigrated to the US from outside Krakow in 1904.  They came from families of Catholic farmers. They kept contact with their families back in Poland.  My grandparents were born in the 1920s, and also kept some contact with family back jn poland.  After WWII started, all contacts were lost.  Looking at records in the 1990s,  my father found that two somewhat distant family members (like one  second cousin of my grandfather and one second cousin of my grandmother) survived.  Everyone that my Grandparents knew of was gone,  like they never existed. |-| 
|-| cobmgcu || 6 || It's very easy to forget that Hitler's stated goals included the eradication of all Slavs as well. When he invaded the USSR, his plan was to exterminate the entire urban population of Eastern Europe in order to make room for the German Elite. The initial plans were to enslave the rural Slavs and have them grow all the food that the Third Reich would eventually need once it conquered Europe and half of Asia. Then as mechanization replaced them, he could kill them off too.

Basically Hitler intended to kill every Slav in existence. Some pretty grim stuff. |-| 
|-| cobfwmt || 12 || Also, did the nazis kill the non jewish poles for the same reason they killed the jews?  Or maybe the question should be did the nazis kill the jews for the same reason they killed the poles? |-|

|-| cobv5yp || 8 || I very much disprove of your title. It should say Nazi's, not Germans |-| 
|-| cob2taj || 11 || Before they rounded up the Jews, the Nazis made sure that any dissent was quashed by imprisoning anyone who criticized them. The first concentration camps were built for this purpose. Read Anna Segher's *The Seventh Cross* for an excellent picture of pre-war German fascism. |-| 
|-| cobmyvp || 3 || My wife and I are history buff's and learned that of the 10-11 million people the Nazi's and Germans slaughtered in death camps, many were not Jews. When they couldn't find enough Jews, they took Gypsies, Jehovah Witnesses, handicapped people, mentally retarded individuals, any "inferior" people that "watered down" the race. |-| 
|-| cob2h0f || 8 || Yes, the lessons of concentration camps should never have been to create a new 'special' group but to say 'no special groups EVER AGAIN."

|-| cobk18g || 5 || Oh no, they only killed 6 million Jews...the other people were 'collateral damage'

just ask anybody..."how many people died in the concentration camps?" - and they will most likely answer "6 million Jews", because *unfortunately, that seems to be all they want you to care about...* |-| 
|-| cob3zo7 || 4 || So when everyone quotes "6 million" are they including these people, or just Jews? |-| 
|-| cobigmr || 3 || No, the NAZIs did that... Not the "Germans".

I won't pretend that German citizens are guilt free, but your post implies all Germans approved the genocides.

The German people elected the NAZI party under the promise of restoring an economy damaged by WWI reparations. The party rapidly ran away from the people and it's promises, and assumed total control of the government. 

At that point, your average citizen was just as helpless as those being persecuted. If you attempted to help a Jewish neighbor you would be put into the concentration camp with them.

I am first generation German American and I can tell you for a fact, this weighs heavily on my relatives who were around during the Reich. My great aunt has wept openly over childhood friends who were taken away. The " Germans " didn't do that... The NAZIs did. |-|

1. 110 pounds is right on the border of normal and underweight for a 5'5" woman, which is about average height. So 110 is perfectly acceptable for a large percentage of women.

2. "Permanently set"? What were they supposed to do, make a tiny functioning scale? Of course they just put a sticker with a number on it.

The city in Ohio is actually named for the Society of the Cincinnati (the governor of the northwest territory at the time was also the president of the society and he changed the name for his society).

Bringing this up is lame as fuck because the Society of the Cincinnati was a group that sought to emulate  the virtues of Cincinnatus.

Same thing with hearing. You get accustomed to loud noises and "tune" them out. Like when you're driving your car on a rainy day and you have the stereo up...when you get in it the next morning HOLY SHIT THIS IS LOUD!

All of our senses are that way, including sight. If you "adapted" to a very still image, it would disappear. Hence, your eyes are always imperceptibly moving to prevent this from happening.

|-| cobfvbv || 6 || In Psych 101 the professor told us about this in a lab we had.  Something interesting is that if your eyes aren't moving your eye basically stops working (I think it has to do with the optic nerve not receiving any feedback or something like that).

To test this we had ping pong balls that were cut in half with a small red dot painted on the inside concave section.  If you covered your eye with the ball (and shut your other eye), focused on the red dot your eye would stop moving around, and you would essentially go blind (the world would just fade to black).

An easier way to physically stop your eyeball from moving.  Press on your eyeball through your eyelids (or in the outer section where your eyelids meet).  Within seconds your eye will stop working and fade to black.  When you let go it will quickly come back.

It's kind of freaky. |-|

&gt;On February 21 in 2001, Kutcher had received a call from his new love interest Ellerin.

&gt;The student, aspiring model and part-time stripper had tried to make a date with the then 23-year-old actor - but Kutcher had fatefully turned down the offer.

&gt;He said he would later come to visit her at her Hollywood bungalow - just behind the famous Grauman's Chinese Theatre.

&gt;Kutcher told police that he later tried to call Ellerin twice during the evening but she had not picked up her phone.

&gt;Kutcher drove to her apartment at 10.45pm in the hope of smoothing over what he thought was a looming argument, and found that the lights were on in her apartment and her car was parked outside.

&gt;After knocking on the door and calling out to her with no answer, Kutcher said he looked through a window into the apartment and saw what he thought was red wine pooled on the floor.

&gt;He thought she was angry at him for not making the earlier date and left.

|-| cob400x || 80 || &gt; At least three reasons may account for the racial and ethnic differences in obesity. First, racial and ethnic groups differ in behaviors that contribute to weight gain; second explanation may be differences in individual attitudes and cultural norms related to body weight. A third explanation may be differences in access to affordable, healthful foods and safe locations to be physically active; this limited access may negatively impact diet and physical activity levels.

Get your minds out of the gutter, people. West Hollywood is full of beautiful young guys. The photog probably realized this was a straight guy who needed headshots and he did him a favor just because he was cool. Headshot photographers NEVER give you the negatives so the fact that he just gave him the undeveloped film out of the camera speaks volumes about what a favor this guy did for Chris Pratt. And now all gay men stand a little taller due to him. Let’s all be like that guy. Most of us are anyway.

Broccoli in a hair salon in 1966, in London, had given Lazenby his first shot at getting the role. Broccoli had made a mental note to remember Lazenby as a possible candidate at the time when he thought Lazenby looked like a Bond."*

|-| cog9ua6 || 90 || Yep, the Sith were around for thousands of years.  But out of the Sith lore, I still think Bane was one of the better ones.   In that he started the rule of two, because he thought the Sith we becoming more like politicians, and less like rightful leaders that he thought they should be.  So he essentially tricked the Sith into using a "thought bomb" that they thought would wipe out the Jedi, but it backfired and killed all the Sith and several Jedi.  And then established his rule of two so that they could preserve the legacy of the Sith until the right moment to finish off the Jedi at the right moment to control the galaxy.

 |-| 
|-| cogkgbx || 4 || I'd call this bullshit by default but it happened to me, in Florence, long before I first heard about Stendhal syndrome (by the way, this is the first time I hear it attributed to a particular place). This was about 15 years ago.

I was there with my high school class (we traveled to Italy for a week as a sort of farewell trip). We were about 16 years old. At that time I was much more interested in graffiti than in Renaissance's art, and we had heard the rumor that in Italy they sold an ink to fill our graffiti markers that could not be erased from any surface (Nero D'Inferno, if you want to check). A couple of friends and I had spent all our free time going from shoe-store to shoe-store looking for it, and not paying attention to the city at all.

Suddenly we took a turn at a random street and there was the Duomo in front of us, really close. It was so big, so indescribably beautiful in so many ways my brain overloaded and I had to literally sit down so I wouldn't fall. I spent the next hour there, sitting and completely awed. My friends didn't feel the same way and just kept looking for the ink. I couldn't care less.

I've thought about it a lot and I believe my reaction was due to a mix of the unexpectedness, that the Duomo is really huge and that it's beautiful as a whole, but also in every little aspect of it. Probably my brain tried to focus on so many things at the same time and collapsed. It was fucking awesome.

I've seen a few amazing places in my life, I'm easily impressed by beauty and might even overreact to it, but none have ever felt the same. Maybe a few mountain landscapes have made me feel a bit dizzy. I didn't care much about cathedrals at the time nor I do now . But every time I go to Florence I have to go there again, find the street I took the turn at and try to repeat it. Obviously it doesn't happen, but the experience left a big impression on me.

As a skeptic I can't help but to think that the Stendhal syndrome is a far fetched claim, probably abused and overstated. But I also like to think other people have felt the same thing I did that day. I wish I could live that again. |-| 
|-| cofy2at || 6 || I read that as, "Florence's fantastic fart" like, 5 times. |-| 
|-| cogdr6q || 48 || &gt; But the wound was actually a mast cell tumor that had already been treated by several veterinarians in the city, said Tarangelo, who shared medical paperwork with DNAinfo showing Spot's treatments.

&gt;"This approximately 15-year-old dog was suffering from a number of serious medical conditions," the spokeswoman said in the email.

This isn't like PETA stealing a dog off someone's porch and killing it in the van (fuck those guys, seriously). A 15-yr old dog with a huge tumor and purportedly other problems as well? As much as I hate to admit it putting him down was probably the best recourse.

That said they should have made a better attempt to communicate with the owner...who on the other hand is homeless and may not have been easy to reach. On the other other hand he claims he called them every day, but never says what, if anything, they told him. |-| 
|-| cogfbs5 || 20 || I'm wondering how many people who are commenting here looked through the slideshow beyond the young healthy dog that the guy is posing with in the first photo to see [what the dog that was euthanized looked like when it was seized](http://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/photo/2014/08/sad-dog-1408561042.jpg/extralarge.jpg). |-| 
|-| cog6bjo || 58 || &gt;Skeptical of pharmaceutical drugs, Tarangelo also researched homeopathic treatments for Spot. A friend helped him write a letter to a holistic veterinarian, Dr. Stacey Hershman, who had given him advice over the phone about his other dog, Cinnamon, back in 2009. 

&gt;Cinnamon has since died — she was euthanized five years ago with Tarangelo's permission at Fifth Avenue Veterinary Specialists after a vet there told him Cinnamon was in too much pain. |-|

At that rate, the particle could have traveled for the entire duration of the universe's existence while experiencing less than sixteen days subjective time. |-|

|-| cogd7qc || -21 || As a rational logical atheist-scientist, I am outraged that these "scientists", who are obviously religious funDIE infiltrators, are pushing their religion on us real (atheist) scientists by putting "God" in the name of anything related to science.

|-| cog7426 || 26 || When my father was a boy in Germany, he got in trouble for trading potatoes from his fathers farm for chocolate from American POWs. |-| 
|-| cogg2rl || 8 || I wonder what was the mortality rate of Chinese POW's. |-| 
|-| cogljte || 7 || Just for comparison, this [site](http://www.historynet.com/german-pows-and-the-art-of-survival.htm) says axis prisoners held in American hands also had about a 1% mortality rate, though it does not distinguish between German, Japanese or other prisoner nationalities. |-| 
|-| cogjoc8 || 4 || I worked with a woman whose late husband was a POW in Japan. He never ever trusted anything Japanese after the war and when Japanese cars came to American, he had a very hard time dealing with people forgetting what the vets went through.

 |-| 
|-| cogphp3 || 3 || My dad was taken prisoner on Corregidor.  He wouldn't talk much about what happened to him except that when Japan surrendered he and some other American POW's broke out of their camp in Tokyo when they heard American occupation forces were landing, and hijacked a locomotive. |-| 
|-| cogitfq || 8 || Germans took pride in being civilized nation and treating people humanely during the WW2. The catch is, Jews and Slavs weren't people, plus almost no one knew about the situation in concentration camps |-|

|-| cogaxnf || -14 || The americans bombed the shit out japanese prison ships full of americans to weaken their fleet. Something like 20,000 americans were killed this way. |-| 
|-| cogaozh || 124 || Clearly he was wrong, but he couldn't possibly have anticipated the World Wars, and the resulting desire of German-Americans to no longer identify as Germans. |-| 
|-| cogkmrn || 13 || Only after WW2. My family on my father's side has been in the US since the late 1600s. My father born in WW2 was the first child NOT to use German as the 1st language in the home. That's 250+ years out of the homeland before the home culture lost out... |-|

|-| cogbmp8 || 15 || Would I be considered German-American even though my ancestors came over in the 1600s?  This TIL is a little dumb in that most who  immigrated here prior to the last two generations probably only speak english and/or only took high school spanish.  This TIL can probably be applied to a ton of European Americans AKA white people. |-| 
|-| cogledc || 8 || German American communities spoke in German and published newspapers in German until WW1 some didn't stop until WW2.

 |-| 
|-| cogm0h2 || 3 || So, what you're really saying is that it took  the Germans 264 years to assimilate.

Right?
 |-| 
|-| cogbj6q || 10 || Of course he did. Isn't hating immigrants a requirement of being old here in the US? |-| 
|-| cogq9rs || 3 || WWII happened in there and speaking German became something you shouldn't do which would be a big influence on this statistic. |-|

|-| cog3om6 || 6 || I've always known about the "satisfaction brought it back" part because that's what my smart ass would respond with when somebody gave me the curiosity line.

I always took it to mean that satisfying the cat's curiousity brought it back to life, hence, my response. |-| 
|-| cog0o87 || 3 || That's why I'm all about that satisfaction baby. |-|
