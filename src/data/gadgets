We need to accept the fact that as we reach a plateau in terms of phone dimensions, there's going to be phones that look the same.

Also, one needs to realize that there are scores of people in developing countries that want a good looking smartphone that provides decent specs but can't afford the exorbitantly priced big flagship phones. Therefore, a legit company selling similarly designed phones is better than the majority of iphone/galaxy knock-offs being sold in the black market (which are mostly terrible to use and come with no customer support).  |-|

Not to be cynical but this is a device without an actual target market. Tablets, laptops and phones all easily do what this device does and if you need precision on your control that a touchpad can give you then maybe you should just use a real mouse with your PC/Laptop/Tablet.

Keyboards don't move much once they're put into place so having the computer housed inside the keyboard in much the same way the Commodore 64 did it would be a much better option.
