Takes me maybe 5 minutes to warm up for bench - 45x10, 95x5, 135x5, 185x3 then work sets. Today was 220x5x5, took me maybe 30 minutes start to finish including warm ups.

Also, do you really need such long rests between sets? I limit myself to 5 mins max, and that's only if I was really struggling after a set with 2-3 mins.

Do your run. If you want, do something like Agile 8 or 11 or whatever his recent one is. Then your warm up for each lift is just the reps, nothing else is really required, and you certainly shouldn't need rest beyond the time it takes to load the bar. Warm ups should not affect your work sets, otherwise they would be called work sets. |-| 
|-| cntw5xn || 3 || Your warmups are way too long. Don't rest in between warm-up sets, just rest once after all warm-ups before your first work set, and in between work sets. If I can immediately get squat rack/benches the actual lifting only takes me an hour (my squat and bench are lower than yours though). That aside, I agree with you. I usually do 3x5 these days as well, and I don't notice much difference in progression. I do 5x5 when I have time, and don't hassle myself about it when I don't. |-|

|-| cntwkyy || 150 || &gt; I am never tired enough to actually fall asleep at a time that would equate to 8 hours of sleep.

This possibly boils down to your "pre-sleep ritual". What do you do before you sleep? Do you browse reddit on your laptop? Scroll away on Instagram on your phone? Do you leave the lights on for long periods after you lie in bed? All these habits affect your body's ability to fall asleep.


I used to do these things after I went to bed (mostly browse away on reddit on my phone). Now I just switch off all the lights and gadgets at home about half an hour before I plan to sleep. Your body releases [melatonin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin) (the sleep hormone) as a reaction to dark-light periods. I sleep better overall.

TL;DR: switch off the lights and your gadgets before you go to sleep. |-|

Black beans. Dirt cheap too, $0.50/can. Tastes amazing. And more fiber than you've ever eaten in your life. Get ready for amazing shits. You'll feel full for hours because of the complex carbs, high fiber, &amp; (surprisingly) high protein. Just gotta remember it's an incomplete protein, so make sure you don't solely rely on beans as your protein source. |-| 
|-| cntx5e7 || 7 || First of all, good on you for making the effort to bounce back. Cancer is a bitch, and the recovery afterwards can in many ways be just as tough.

In terms of building up general strength, the sidebar has a lot of great example programs for someone just getting started. The basic idea is to focus on few compound movements to build strength and start building muscle, do these consistently and lift more weight every time you work out. The popular programs that people start with are Stronglifts and Starting Strength. But you could even do something like Greyskull LP and be fine. 
Note, if you have any sort of musculoskeletal injuries from cancer, treatment or surgeries, I would recommend talking to a physical therapist who's experienced in these sorts of things. Get a couple opinions. 

For diet, there are lots of foods that aren't dry or require a lot of chewing that will offer you a lot of nutrients and calories. Peanut butter and bananas are great. I'd also recommend things like oatmeal (make it with whole milk), sweet potatoes, cottage cheese, greek yogurt, pureed beans, dunk your bread into liquid to make it easier to eat. You can also puree some meat soups to make them easier to swallow.

Hopefully that provides some guidance. As a cancer survivor myself, I know how difficult it can be to get back on track. But starting is the most important step. Best of luck! |-|

|-| cntxaw1 || 10 || First of all, congratulations on surviving! That's seriously amazing and you're clearly a strong person so fitness will probably come natural to you. 

Second, stop being so hard on yourself, particularly with your appearance.

Third, I'd definitely talk to your doctor before you start doing anything serious. I'm not a doctor, and neither is anyone here. But, if you want to gain weight, the first thing you're going to do is eat at a caloric surplus. Splurge: eat lots of different yummy stuff, but make sure you're getting the right amount of macros. 

Popular and very effective beginner programs are [starting strength](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ:Introduction), [strong lifts 5x5](http://stronglifts.com/) and, if you like bodyweightfitness, the /r/bodyweightfitness [beginning routine](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/training_guide#wiki_beginner_routine). 

You can learn much, much more about this stuff by reading the [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/index). Definitely talk to your doctor about it, particularly what you can do with your bad arm, and good luck! Remember- you beat cancer, so that barbell shouldn't stand a chance. |-|

|-| cntxfmj || 73 || Hi, cancer researcher who happens to lift here wanting to give a quick bit of input.  I've mentioned it before but while most cancer patients are perfectly fine to lift weights after therapy, if you had chemotherapy with a drug called "doxorubicin", "daunorubicin", or any other in a class of drugs called anthracyclines then you need to be very very careful lifting weights.

These drugs cause significant cardio toxicity both short and long-term (you would be followed up for the rest of your life with echocardiograms to determine something called your ejection fraction, or how much blood your left ventricle pumps out).

Other drugs with known (but less significant) cardiotoxicity include but are not limited to: cytoxan, ifosfamide, cisplatin, and busulfan.

I know carboplatin (related drug to cisplatin) is a typical chemo agent for head and neck cancer so you definitely want to consult your oncologist regarding any potential cardiotoxicity and potentially getting an echo before he clears you for heavy weight.

If you do have minor cardiotoxicity from these drugs, what we often recommend based on Children's Oncology Group guidelines (kids get doxorubicin and have lifelong heart issues but want to workout eventually) is to not do rep ranges lower than ~10.  Anything where you have to do what's called a "valsalva" maneuver where you have to grind out a rep is BAD if you have heart issues.  Low reps are highly touted here but contraindicated in that population - you can still make great progress in higher rep ranges.

If you only got surgery then hit the wiki, pick a plan, and have fun!

Cable flies, dumbbell bench, dips, dumbbell flies, pick 1 and do 5x10 or 5x15. If you really want a muscle to grow (I mean in appearance) you need volume overload. 

You say you've changed routines - guaranteed way to be inconsistent and inefficiently train your muscles.

It wasn't until I really started focusing on grip changes with both dumbbell press and dumbbell flies that I saw a huge burst in chest mass. I would also recommend doing isolated chest machines to burn out and do negatives at the end of your chest workouts. Something you can do without a spotter. Remember to focus your mind to your muscle, make sure your chest is the only muscle firing and control the weight. I like doing extra slow on the negative phase and fast press on the positive phase, this will allow you to work both muscle fiber types allowing for most amount of growth! It's more about volume as a whole vs just heavy weight. Good luck!!   |-| 
|-| cntz2cq || 7 || Just in terms of the muscles, sleep is necessary to reach a state of total enervation throughout the body. No matter how hard you might try, it is impossible to fully relax all of your deep, postural support muscles while awake. Even if all you're doing is lying motionless, your brain will maintain tone in those muscles it considers necessary for some readiness to move. |-| 
|-| cntz485 || 4 || Chest dips have worked wonders for me. Especially since I started weighting them. |-| 
|-| cntz7eg || 5 || My brother has your problem, so I'm inclined to think that maybe I've overcome similar genetics. It's also possible I just have a responsive chest and the only advice I could legitimately give is "be lucky like me". Such is the problem with anecdotal evidence. 

When I started lifting (junior year in high school) I saw tremendous gains. Noticeably in my legs, but holy shit noticeably in my chest. I remember noticing that as I was looking straight ahead, I could see something blue at the bottom of my field of vision. I looked down. It was my shirt I was seeing. My chest was now just always in my field of view. I vividly remember that shirt because of that moment. There was also a time (similar timeframe) when I was walking past a mirror and tried to flatten out my bunched shirt. Nope. That bunch was just my pecs. So, that's what you have to look forward to if this all pans out.

Secret of success #1:  I had me some chub for chest day. (It's tough to say whether that's why I succeeded or whether I was so stoked because of all the success. Either way, the one leads to the other which leads back to the first one again.)  I remember sitting at lunch telling everybody, "It's chest day!" They didn't give two shits and told me as much. Which makes sense, it wasn't OUR chest day. Just mine. I have no idea why I thought they might want to be stoked for me. 

Secret of Success #2: Pyramid sets. These numbers are way old news, but I guess my high school chub for chest day has burned them into my mind.

1: 12 reps of 95.

2: 10 reps of 115.

3: 8 reps of 135.

4: 6 reps of 155.

5: 4 reps of 185.  (a 25 instead of 2 10's) 

6: 2 reps of 205. 

7: 4 reps of 185.

And so on, back up to 12 reps of 95. As this set got easier and easier I started going for burnout on the final two sets. Trying for 20 of the final 95. 

After a while my chest got to the point where it was too big. Too big relative to the rest of me and too big with regard to my ability to play sports. Also too big in terms of women's opinions, actually. Now I just chill and do 3 x 5 x 275 to maintain. It's over much quicker and I have zero interest in getting my chest any bigger.

I hope it pans out for you! |-|

One of the things I noticed was that, while I was in very good shape pre-cancer, it wasn't like how I was pre cancer (for obvious reasons). I found it better to take it easy and do what my body will allow me to do. Between chemo and sleeping so much, I experienced a little bit of atrophy... albeit I'm young, so it wasn't as bad. But bad enough to set me back about 6 months!

I work for a research group that specifically works to figure out exercise therapies for people undergoing cancer treatment and people who have survived it. For chemo patients (I think that's what you underwent- correct me if I'm wrong), we generally recommend using resistance bands and light dumbbells before jumping into more intense work such as bench press or deadlift, especially if you were on anthracyclines. Yoga also appears to have yielded fantastic results for cancer survivors, but our data is not complete on that just yet. 

Good luck getting that strength back! |-|

BB Bench 5x5 205, 225, 245, 265, 285
Cable Flyes 12-10-8 80,90,100 
BB Incline 10-8-6 215,225,235
DB Incline Flyes 12-10-8 60,65,70
Weighted Dips 3x8 25,30,35

Slow on the way down, explode up on pressing. Make sure you squeeze the fuck outta your pecs when you do flyes. 

Keep in mind squats, deads, rows, and OHP will help your bench indirectly, everything is connected. 

I'm also 5'11" 225lbs a little over 20% bf.

|-| cnu4vjk || 5 || Save some cash and don't take ZMA |-| 
|-| cnu4w7a || 3 || I switched to 3x5 after a few months because it took me too long to complete 5x5.

I also only ever allow myself a 90 second rest  even if it means that I fail. 

I think that your warm-up is too long. 

This is me:

Treadmill: 2 minute walk. 3 minute sprint.
Groin stretches: 45s - 1m

Squat:

Warm-up: 10 reps empty bar. No rest. 20kg 3 reps. No rest. 40kg 3 reps. No rest. 60kg 3 reps. No rest. 70kg 2 reps. 90s rest. 

Working set. 90s rest between sets.

Bench:

Warm-up: 10 reps empty bar. No rest. 20kg 3 reps. 35kg 3 reps. 90s rest. 

Working set. 90s rest between sets. 

I also have time for pull-ups when it is deadlift day. 

As you can see... That goes on throughout the workout.

|-| cnu5dpc || 5 || Fat is satiating. As long as you add fat to whatever you're eating, a little will fill you up quickly. 

Obviously, we're talking about healthy fats: butter from grass fed cows, olive oil, avocados, fat from quality meats, full fat dairy, etc.  
 |-| 
|-| cnu5iyj || 3 || You don't "need" to rest 7 minutes. You will always be able to lift more by taking longer rests, that's irrelevant. Your rest time is part of your program. 

Personally I take about 1 minute between warmup sets and exactly 2 minutes between work sets (I use a timer). If I know I'm likely to fail and I really don't want to deload I might rest longer on the last set, but normally I just stick to the scheduled rest time and deload as required. My lifts are comparable to yours. |-|

A 1.5 mile run at a 10 min/mi pace is not going to burn enough glucose to impact a program like SL 5x5 unless you train fasted and have 4% body fat.

|-| cnu7o2z || 3 || Just be careful man.  Idk her or you, but I've never had success working out with significant others.  Ever.  It leads to arguments and potentially turning them off the gym.

Let her do what she wants.  If she doesn't want to do an exercise don't make her.  Don't use the same motivational techniques as with your buddies.  Saying ONE MORE three times doesn't work the same way in my experience.

I think j could work out with a girlfriend now.. But it's taken a lot of learning.  If she's not the type to already be into it, just be aware and think about how you show her things, motivate her, etc.  it's also going to be super annoying splitting equipment with her but you probably know that. |-| 
|-| cnu7uf0 || 7 || I'm 5'4 and 125 lb as well. I do the same lifts as my boyfriend but keep in mind women often need to start SUPER light. Give her the 10 lb weights first for arms, and squats with only the bar, and see where you can go from there. If her feelings are hurt by the light weight (I know it made me feel really pathetic) just encourage her that she needs really good form. Even a year later, my maximum weight in each hand is 35 lb. The noob gains are good but I hit a wall.  And I still don't look muscular, I'm just really firm now as opposed to skinny-fat.  |-|

|-| cnu9fv4 || 4 || Hurling. PULL HARD!!! |-| 
|-| cnua22t || 3 || Okay, so years lurker and this is the post that I feel things need to be said that are not being said.

My background with working out with females:  Long time obese child (till the ripe ol’ age of 17, surpassed my father in pant size by the age of 12) and at some point I began to get myself into shape.  My sisters wanted to do the same (I have 3) and I learned a lot about the difference between working out when it comes to genders.  I am by no means an expert, so take what I say with a grain of salt.

First thing ASK WHAT SHE WANTS TO IMPROVE.  Males and females have different ideas about needs to be improved.  When a guy says he wants to work on his arms, he usually means bigger biceps (in general), when a female says she wants to work on her arms she usually means to tone the back of the arm flab away.  So take the time to really identify what she wants to improve and focus on it.

Second, she wants to get tone, not big so her regiment should be more reps less weight.  My physical therapist (Had one for a few months of losing weight to ensure I was not losing it at an unhealthy rate) was/is a big person on 3 sets of 15 reps for toning.  I cannot say no to the logic because this is his field of study and well respected in it.

She will probably not benefit very much from doing your routine (even with appropriate weights and reps) because you are after different objectives.  I suggest changing your routine slightly to be able to work with her in it until she really gets the hang of it.  (Classes are a great idea for this!)  Your goal is to help her achieve her goals in a comfortable environment.  While working with her for the first few weeks (this applies to training with anyone new) ALWAYS ask how they feel as they do exercises.  Does something hurt?  Or is it sore?  Does it feel like your goals are being achieved?  Help her understand the difference between soreness and pain.  Pain means stop, soreness means what you are doing is working.  Teach her good form so that she can remain healthy, remember: her objective to get healthy/tone not big.

TLDR: Ask what she wants to work on, high reps low weight, be there for her.

|-| cnuaj9t || 4 || looks good. can't see your feet so not sure if your toes are straight. good to see you are breaking 90. maybe try to drive with your heels a bit more - looks like you kind of lean forward a bit at a time in the lift. hard to tell with your sweater but just always remember to keep your upper body tight.  keep adding weight. this doesn't mean toss on another plate, just add a couple 5's maybe 10's and see how that feels.  you should be able to tell if you are not capable of lifting any more weight |-|

|-| cnuc4os || 4 || I joined a small gym/training center (not Crossfit) last summer when I finally decided to get serious about lifting. There was a group of 4-5 guys (and sometimes girls) who would work out at 6am. We bonded quickly and supported each other as we made improvements. The ability level in the group ranged from elite athlete to 50-something normal dude trying to get in shape. It didn't matter though. The chemistry was just right and the trainers killed us (in a good way).

Unfortunately, at the end of 2014, the owner decided to close it down. Now I feel lost. I'm still looking for a new place that gives me at least some of what I had before.

Regardless..

Ending Squat weight: 5x195lbs

Dead: Not sure..my form was really bad so I had to deload and fix it recently, but around mid 200lbs

Bench: 5x150lbs

OHP: 90lbsx5

BW: 137 (back then, at 140-142 now)

Height: 5'6


I switched to Madcow. I wouldn't recommend switching as early as I did. I did it because the squats had gotten too tough and I didn't inform myself about SL enough to learn that I could drop to 3x5 and 3x3. Also fixing my form made squats easier.

I ran madcow for about 2 months

My stats now are

Bench: 2x175lbs, 1RM is 190

Squat: 5x215, 1RM is 245

DL: 5x235, 1RM is 275

OHP is 5x95 and 1RM is 110.

|-| cnugaz2 || 4 || Assuming you're talking about lifting, there's no reason a woman should be lifting any differently than a man, especially when it comes to beginner programs. My boyfriend and I both began with Starting Strength in university and it was great- the only difference was the actual weights we were each using, of course! 


Your girlfriend is super lucky to have someone so supportive, experienced, and full of resources. Both of you should discuss the specific goals she has in mind (e.g. fat loss, 'I want to do a pull up', building a booty, etc) and work from there. Just continue to encourage her (it can be intimidating for a woman to enter the weight room for the first time) and help her with stuff like nutrition and proper form. Also please encourage her- and any other girl who is interested in lifting- to aim for the heavy stuff. Like most of my female friends, it took me a while to figure out things like scale vs. measurements, what 'toning' really is, what the hell a 'bulk' and 'cut' was, and how you can actually look better at a higher weight (shocking, right?!) if you build the muscle to create that fit, athletic look that many of us desire. 


Lastly, women with zero experience with weights may need to start really light. Like I had to start practicing squat and bench form with those 20lb bars, and curling 5lbs was tough. Upper body strength was completely nonexistent. I can't thank my boyfriend enough for being so patient with all the times I was so frustrated at being so weak, when in reality I was getting stronger every day even though my progress was slow. 


Final note- if you're also concerned about other aspects of working out together, or things that ladies in particular may have to deal with (e.g. exercising while on your period, finding cute gym apparel, dealing with sexual harassment at the gym, learning how to deal with the 'but women shouldn't lift so heavy, you'll get bulky!!' comments), I highly recommend you direct her to r/xxfitness. We're a much smaller community but it's full of super awesome people :) Hope you two have a great time together!  |-|

Ah, here we are. You can choose any routine from the wiki and gain size as long as you eat, eat, eat. Gotta be at a caloric surplus if you want bigger muscles. You only need one movement for each muscle group, so long as you are progressing linearly. If you haven't been progressing, eat more and watch your strength and hypertrophy skyrocket.

Foam rolling is not more painful than DOMS.

Buy the barbell set. It's safe as long as you start light.

|-| cnupihm || 18 || My main focus for lifting isn't to be fit. Right now, lifting is the only thing holding back my depression during this rut I'm having. Looking good is just a side effect to making it easier getting out of my bed every morning. |-| 
|-| cnupk80 || 10 || Because the first time i held my (at the time) two month old god-daughter my arms were burning after ten minutes.  That was my reality check.

|-| cnupkt9 || 3 || I see people in my life, friends, coworkers, family, who are overweight and out of shape. I still love them but seeing them like that scares me. I don't want to be that and it's extremely easy to become that. I've always been thin but the last few years of school and a new desk job I've stated gaining weight. I guess now I'm skinny fat. And as much as it's about appearance I hate that I'm not as capable as I used to be. I'm young and I'm already looking back to when I was in better shape. These things scare me. I feel like I'm at a cross roads. If I don't change things and form better habits I'll become the same obese mid thirties guy who has diabetes and back problems. I miss the feeling of being light on my feet and being able to run seemingly forever.  |-| 
|-| cnupl8n || 10 || My PT told me that most cases can be fixed by sliding your head back from the forward head posture to the correct and aligned posture.

I used to think the dress made the woman, now I believe the woman makes the dress. 

Working out makes me feel powerful and confident. In sports, if the opponent is bigger than me, I can still be stronger and more aggressive, regardless of disadvantages I can't change. 

I also work out because I like knowing I am physically able to do whatever I want: sports, moving heavy boxes, walking/running long distances, etc. |-|

|-| cnuqpf7 || 545 || There are lots of good reasons, but one defining moment that did it for me.

I was on a plane headed to Vancouver for the 2010 Olympics. It just so happened the Swedish Skiercross team was on the same flight. Once seated in my aisle seat, I looked across the gap to see the most striking juxtaposition of my life.

In one aisle seat was an obese/overweight/orb-waisted guy - barely out of his late 20's, ponytail greased by his own "hard to walk a while" sweat, acne lubricated by the same, and breathing heavily in an effort to sit down for a while. Probably thought a "deadlift" was what necromancers did.

Directly behind him was literally the peak of human existence, all brought to us exclusively by the glorious benefits of exercise. It wasn't the blonde hair or chiseled jaw that made him so striking; it was his confident posture, his broad shoulders, the complete ease with which he sat in comfortable existence. This guy was at best the same age (probably a good sight older) and had spent his life putting his body through the brutality of rigorous training to become one of the best in the world at what he did - and (Br)Olympus shined upon him.

Sure, it helped that it was icky neckbeard vs. Hitler's dreamseed, but it was more than that; those aspects they couldn't fully control. What they both had power over was their activities, their breathing, their choice of life. And because of their own decisions and dedications, one looked like he had difficulty simply existing while the other breezed along confidently with admiration in his wake.

I'll never be on his level, but seeing the difference between Sloth and Glory just four short feet from each other was a complete eye-opener, and lifelong lesson. |-|

Some lifts will lag and others will just blow up. That's just the nature of lifting. Maybe on an off day, incorporate some accessory lifts: incline, dumbbell presses, dumbbell flies, seated shoulder barbell/dumbbell press, and more importantly, tricep work. A good majority of Your power/work used for Bench press believe it or not comes from triceps.  |-|

Long hard road ahead but I'm sure it will be worth it. |-| 
|-| cnuri40 || 23 || when you're lifting regularly, the soreness in your muscles is noticeable, but it doesn't prevent you from doing anything, or weaken you, or tire you. For example, among my friends who play rugby (IMO at least as grueling as a big strength workout) and wait tables the next day, they definitely notice all the soreness much more than they would sitting on the couch, but far prefer being up and around from a recovery perspective. 

One thing you will have to deal with is the first week of extreme soreness you'll get when you start a strength routine. It can make you very stiff to the point of not wanting to move around much. You can limit this by starting your strength routine with slightly lighter weight or fewer reps than you otherwise would...but you'll probably still get a fair amount of soreness for the first couple weeks. I don't think you can eliminate the severe soreness when you start, but you might be able to spread it out over an extra week or two to make it more manageable.  |-| 
|-| cnurksw || -4 || You are 14, you really need to be careful about what you are doing. Your body is still growing, doing dead lifts and squats can hamper bone growth. The target part of your body affected from too much will be your spine. However, You definitely are doing a very substantial amount of weight and you've got some crazy maxes. that's a lot of dedication.

I suggest doing something to help build bicep muscle. Make a plan to have a workout or part of a workout that targets this muscle. When you bench your target muscles are the pecs and the biceps.

To stimulate more muscle growth in your chest you can try doing dips. Some other machines you can try are the seated dip, inclined chest press, and declined chest press.   |-|

Sounds like you need to work on your core strength. Good thing is you do not need a lot of time or equipment to do core strength programs.

Search youtube for core strength, here's one I liked: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxkroQcuY64

If you want to add instability, get a TRX suspension band or a knockoff on ebay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gagl23KZs0U

I got one of these for travel, and there's nothing you can't do with it. Put your feet or hands in there, and a simple push-up will become the most intense exercise ever. There are enough videos on youtube to make buying a DVD training program unnecessary.

|-| cnut9nr || 3 || A number of reasons really. It's just something to do, I block out the rest of the world and I improve myself. I was always the slowest runner, the most unfit, the weakest, and to top it all off, I was skinnyfat my whole life (still am, which is why I'm working on it). I was an easy target, always got picked on, and could never stand up for myself, if I tried, I'd get my ass whupped. And I felt like shit, I want to have stamina, strength, endurance, speed, flexibility, you name it. I also want to look badass and the kind of guy no one will fuck with. The opposite of what I was growing up really.

I understand that most women prefer more toned and not overly defined/bulky kind of men, but to be honest, I'd feel more comfortable with my top off if I was 185 lbs, 5'10 and 10-12% bodyfat than to be a skinnyfat 155 lbs, 5'10 and 20% bodyfat. I would just work to 160 lbs beach body kind which women like, but I want strength, stamina, endurance, speed, flexibility etc a lot more than I want to look good, so if that means getting more bulky, so be it.

I just want to be the best I can be. Anyone who tries fucking with me when I get there will regret it to the day they die. |-|

We all have *maybe* 10 good years to max out our body's potential and test its limits. 

There's plenty of time to sleep. Plenty of time to drink. Plenty of time  to gorge to your heart's content.

The time to get ripped is now. I'm not gonna waste that shit. |-|

|-| cnuuohc || 5 || 2 years ago, when I was 16, people made fun of me because I'm so thin and weak. Since ''Boys should be stronger than girls.'' people mocked me because I was the weakest of the class and also the smallest. I was sick and tired of being small. I didn't want to be weak anymore.

Especially during sports class. I was great at running and volleybal, but when we did sports that required lots of strength I failed every time.

I wanted to change. My best friend saw me suffering from being bullied. He was big and strong and the only guy who didn't bully me for being small and weak.

''It's about time you start bulking up!'' He said. That weekend I slept at his place. He had a pair of dumbbells and a barbell with plates that were to light for him to train with. That night he learned me all kinds of things about fitness and he trained me. It felt great, although I didn't life a lot of weight back then, I felt great!

Since that night I went to his place every weekend so he could train me, and I started seeing progress.

When I had some more strength, my friend took me to the gym and showed me more advanced excersizes. I started training twice a week in the gym since then.

My strength went up, just a little. I wasn't taking fitness seriously yet. But a year ago I changed. I'm still not big though, but I've changed my lifestyle. I saw the first year as a ''warm up'' year.

I train 5 times a week now, wheter its in the gym or at my friends house. I started taking progress pictures and people started seeing me grow.

Dont get a wrong view of me though, im still pretty small. But I'm proud of where I have come and I have a long road ahead of me. Atleast my classmates stopped bullying me after they heard I started fitness.

I want to beat myself. Become stronger than the boy I was before. I want to bulk up as well and not look so weak anymore.

EDIT: I forgot to mention I also train to gain more convidence in myself. I have a low self-esteem (I think thats what It's called, Im dutch :P) because of my weak looking body. |-|

|-| cnuuqwn || 19 || My wife went to culinary school and is in med school. She makes me cool shit to eat all the time. This is all you can eat cookie dough. It is actually really good for you. And tastes just like cookie dough. 

She takes chick peas and blends them. Blended chick peas has the same texture as cookie dough. She then adds vanilla, truvia, and tiny dark chocolate bits. It's great for when chicken makes me wanna kill myself after each bite.

The looks give me self estem aswell and better feelings, but well i do it for my health and my sport aswell. |-| 
|-| cnuuy0d || 3 || I used to be more in shape many years ago, but through laziness, I gained a ton of weight.

I'd be careful with vanilla extract as it has quite a raw flavour and wouldn't necessarily be pleasant. You might try sticking split vanilla pods into your bag of vanilla whey powder, though. Adds no calories but a lot of flavour. |-|

|-| cnuvlfs || 3 || Before I ask, yes I know the answer is "as long as you hit the macros", but would like to know if there is something I'm doing wrong. My current diet isnt working for me because I am starving half the time. I am in a startup, and I love to cook but I don't have the time or the resources to cook the way I want. One thing that has worked for me, is to eat an entire cauliflower (arounf 700 GMs) (heated in 1 tbsp butter with 4 green chillies and chilli powder) through the day and eat 4 egg whites (with 1 yellow) along with a protein shake of 3 scoops whey. I'm kind of feeling full all the time, hitting the deficit I want and I loooove veggies. I have worked different quantities for other veggies, but the diet is huge quantities of a single vegetable.

|-| cnuweak || 3 || Wondering if being severely under your daily calories is fine for a cut? Im finding this way too easy. I love food and always have but lately with meal prep and counting calories by diligently weighing and measuring out serving sizes, it's turned out to be exciting and I'm not starving myself at all (or at least I don't feel like it?). I'm about 6'3 211 give or take a pound after a nice poop. My maintenance is 2886 cals and I've taken the 'aggressive' approach of trying to hit 2300. 



However the last few days I've been going to bed looking through the MFP log and I am under 2000 calories. The macros that I am missing approximately 19F 100C 30P. I didn't think that was terrible considering it's mostly carbs I'm missing. 



Anyways I want to know if this is acceptable or if I should be trying to hit 2300 calories. Trying to weigh 190ish for April 1st as I head out to California and get out of this Canadian winter. After I get back a week later I'll be bulking again to 230ish. It's extremely strange that I am not hungry because I love bulking and eating what ever the heck I want. But like I said my meal plan right now feels pretty solid with my schedule. If anyone wants to see what I've been eating just let me know and I can show you how to break stuff down. My foods are relatively the same everyday so it's super easy.  |-|

|-| cnv5y0j || 11 || &gt;mostly focusing on strength training with the machines at the gym

Free weights right away, you can use the bar and start light. 

&gt;but I want to know how to use them first and wanted to build up some endurance with the machines as well

Start with the bar, and follow SL5x5 or ICF, you're not building anything on those machines

&gt;Usually I skip breakfast (not good, I know) 

Doesnt matter that you skip breakfast

&gt;a big dinner (again not good)

Also doesnt matter. 

What you have eaten today doesn't look abnormal. Focus on getting your TDEE-500 and meeting your macros. You should feel fuller if you're eating more protein and fats in your diet.  |-| 
|-| cnv60v0 || 6 || no |-| 
|-| cnv61c6 || 12 || No. |-| 
|-| cnv61fp || 5 || Walk away, fuck them.  They don't get to dictate what kind of workout is best for you.  They sound like bitches to start with, for starters anyone who walks into the gym and is on there phone should be kicked out. Its distracting to others and dangerous for them because they aren't paying attention to what they're doing. |-| 
|-| cnv61sx || 18 || Its not rude. She needs to figure out the world doesnt revolve around her, but thats not your issue. |-| 
|-| cnv622o || 6 || Do you pay for the use of them? Yes.

First come first serve. If she wanted to walk or run, she could have asked you when you'd be done. 

I believe she is in the wrong. |-| 
|-| cnv63ek || 45 || I would stop using the treadmill and just start walking briskly over her ignorant ass.    
All jokes aside, don't work yourself up about it; you're not being rude. Most people at the gym are just minding their own business, unfortunately you will also find assholes there, as anywhere in life. |-| 
|-| cnv63tp || 27 || Nope. Most gyms post a limit of 30 mins per machine during peak times, so as long as you are adhering to that and actively using the machine, it's not rude. Is it rude for someone to use a weight machine and only lift 'x weight'? Absolutely not.  |-| 
|-| cnv6a7w || 12 || No it's not rude and 20-30 minutes is not to long to use the treadmill.   |-| 
|-| cnv6yay || 9 || No, it's absolutely not rude to use a treadmill for its intended purpose, which is both walking and jogging. Most gyms limit treadmill use to 30 minutes if someone's waiting, so you're good there too.

Walking is a great way to start exercising so good for you. 

What is rude is going into the laundry room and loudly complaining about people when you know nothing about their lives, medical histories and physical needs. Ignore her.  |-| 
|-| cnv72gz || -5 || In some eastern african cultures it's considered a sign of weakness for a man to be seen walking anywhere. He has to run everywhere he goes.  |-| 
|-| cnv77jw || 5 || Worry more about how you place your foot on the surface, and let the haters be hatin'. They need some excuse for not working out, right? In some large commercial gyms there's a rule that you cannot use the cardio machine for more than 30 mins. If you want some limits, use that. 30 mins, free the machine, if nobody takes it, it's yours again. Now how fast you move on it is nobody's business. |-| 
|-| cnv81xm || 5 || Some people are just bitches, you can't do anything about that.

If you want to spend 20-30 minutes on the treadmill (a perfectly reasonable amount of time btw) walking then you are more than welcome. She could just as easily have gone for a run outside.  |-| 
|-| cnv84jk || 4 || Sometime starting out, counting calories can make you become obsessive over food and think about it more often than you otherwise would.  It's something that should pass. And every once in a while you could take a day off from counting. |-| 
|-| cnv86xt || 5 || This is like someone saying someone is lifting 'just the empty bar' as if it's annoying that they're getting deprived of a squat rack. Fuck that shit. You are 100% fine. |-| 
|-| cnv8azo || 6 || I have the Sole S77 Treadmill, purchased through Amazon. It is a really good treadmill and can handle &gt; 230lbs. I have put about 1400 miles on it since fall 2010. If they are truly going to use the treadmill you want to get something which will last and not suffer from frequent slipping belts or other mechanical breakdowns. If the treadmill does not feel natural when walking or running people will not keep up the activity. To get this you will have to spend some good money. I would avoid craigslist unless you can be sure the treadmill has been well maintained, all of them require routine maintenance such as lubrication and belt adjustments. 

ps - for those treadmill haters, running is fun, some people like it, I enjoy it even on the treadmill  |-| 
|-| cnv8bd1 || 4 || She'll get over it  |-| 
|-| cnv8xm7 || 4 || If you ask the craigslist seller for the model and serial numbers, you can find out how old the machine REALLY is...most ppl will say only a year or two in their ad but really the thing is way older and about shot.

Used treadmills are a pretty good deal as long as you check them out thoroughly.  Don't be afraid to ask the seller to plug it in and run it at full speed, full incline for a few minutes.  

Check the walking belt closely too -- I almost got a broken ankle from one that spontaneously ripped and caught on the roller at 4mph (brisk walk).  Turned out 'used a couple of times' meant 'kept in my non-climate controlled basement and turned brittle'. :-/ |-| 
|-| cnv9v1i || -8 || If there are open machines, then go ahead an knock yourself out.....you're paying for it, that's reasonable. 

But if there is wait for machines, and your lazy ass is walking, then yes, that is rude. If you want to walk, put on some pants and go outside -- fresh air is better for you anyway.  

When you walk on a treadmill as your "workout", you're just wasting your own time, when you do it when no machines are open you're wasting other peoples time too.

|-| cnva9nh || 7 || Your bar position tells us high bar squat. Your movement hints towards low bar and SL5x5 calls for low bar. Which is it?

If you're intending to low bar then you need to [correct your bar position](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2tyOLvArw0). The corrected bar position should feel better for your balance. You're getting onto your toes a fair bit but, again, that may be due to the bar position. I suggest practicing the "sit back" motion with the new bar position and working on your depth. |-|

|-| cnvb8z4 || 4 || &gt;Usually I skip breakfast (not good, I know)

It's not that big of a deal. I often skip breakfast when losing weight as it allows my other meals to be larger, and I can fight off hunger signals for hours after I wake up - if I have breakfast then I get even more hungry throughout the day. |-| 
|-| cnvbdze || 5 || Brisk walking is great low impact cardio.  Lots of folks in my gym will go to town for an hour or more while watching their evening news or whatever instead of watching it at home.

I don't advise setting the treadmill to 1.0 while doing this, but if it's actually brisk then you're doing quite a bit of work in that time.

tl;dr:  bitches gonna bitch. |-| 
|-| cnvd80j || 4 || You need to hit proper depth on your squat - it looks like you're a little shallow. It looks like you're rocking forward onto your toes, when you really want to be pushing through with your heels. You may need to work on your ankle mobility, which will also help with depth. Try bunching up your toes next time you squat (which prevent you from putting much weight on the front of your foot) and see how it goes. |-|

|-| cnvhuds || 62 || Hey thatsharrelson,

I'm the creator of ETM and I started the site when I was in college for what sounds like the same reason you want to use it. Still, I want to manage your expectations a little because we get the "it seems too good to be true" response quite a bit, and depending on what you want out of the site, it might be. 

So with the single day planner, you probably have to refresh the meals a couple times before you see something you definitely like. It's the same with the weekly planner - there are ways to improve the suggestions (the best being to set up foods that you already like to eat as "recurring foods"), but every week you'll have to spend a few minutes skimming through the plans and refreshing things until everything looks appetizing. We're working on making the planner more intelligent about learning what you like, but for now, it places most of its emphasis on meeting your nutrition targets.

Another issue is that you'll almost definitely need to go grocery shopping before starting the plans. We recently added a "Pantry" section where you can add stuff you already own, and the algorithms will place some emphasis on using up those foods, but there's still a good chance that it won't be able to maximize their use while still meeting your nutrition targets. The grocery list might also have a couple different versions of a very similar ingredient (like one recipe will use whole milk and another will use lowfat milk), so you'll probably need to make some mental substitutions for ingredients when you go grocery shopping to keep the list practical.

Anyways, I've sent you a gift code to try out the site without your billing info. And if you decide to try it out, I highly recommend filling up the "recurring foods" section of the site with recipes you like to guarantee that the plans are consistently likable. I'm usually pretty lazy so I make it give me the exact same breakfast every day, and my lunches rotate between a couple different types of sandwiches. So despite some of the site's flaws, it still streamlines a ton about the meal planning process and saves me a ton of time every week. YMMV :) |-| 
|-| cnvhz2y || 4 || If you know the workouts you'll be tested on, practice them.

Lower heart rate while exercising is an indicator of good cardiovascular endurance. Exercise 3 to 5 days per week, and gradually increase duration and intensity.

Interval training (alternating between high intensity and low intensity during your workout) can also help train your cardiovascular system to increase/decrease heart rate efficiently. |-| 
|-| cnvikc6 || -3 || Your deadlifts look more like low squats. You are sinking your ass too far. 

Your rows look an inbetween pendlay and bentover. You have bent over rows in your title. It can change a little from person to person but you need to be a bit more upright. I go on a 45 degree. |-| 
|-| cnvjey4 || 3 || There are four categories I can think of that will help you out here.

1: strength.  If you are stronger, the ability to pedal harder or run faster is going to be easier.  This is arguably the least important factor, depending on the specifics of the test, but still important in general.

2: anaerobic endurance / intensity.  If you can run/cycle faster than you are being tested on, going at that slower pace will seem easier.

3: aerobic endurance / duration.  If you can run/cycle further than you are being tested, it will seem easier.  I recently heard a story about a man who had to run a 5k, so every day in training he ran about 7k.  Came in first.

4: efficiency.  Being generally fit is important, but a runner isnt automatically a good cyclist and vice versa.  If you want to get better at these specific tasks, you will need to practice these specific tasks.

All that being said, the simplest way to train would be to have a fast day and a slow day.  So on the fast day you would do things like sprint intervals (up a hill if you're really daring) fartlek training or even just throw in a few sets of burpees as you're jogging/cycling.  On slow days you would take it easy but focus on going further than the task required (keeping heart rate low etc)

Make sure you do both cycling and running on the same day if you're going to be tested on the same day.  In fact, if you know the exact specifics of the test, you could even attempt it at regular intervals just to track your progress.

If you give me more specific details, I could probably help you out further but this is a good starting point. |-|

Whenever you're good enough to lift again, take a day to lighten up the weight and make sure your form is flawless.  |-| 
|-| cnvmp8c || 3 || Oh man would I have a field day with this.  You can make anything from chili to curry soups, to satays, pot pies, enchiladas, tacos, Italian dishes. I mean man, with all that venison, the world is oyster.  |-|

Everyone seems to be throwing vitriol at the doctor and saying things like "all exercises are dangerous using bad form". Which is absolute nonsense. The risk of squats are not even in the same realm as those of say, a chin up. The worst I've seen with chin ups is some mild tendonitis. On the other hand, I've seen a great deal of herniated/bulged discs from squats, more than any other exercise actually. And in guys in their 20s. Many who honestly just wanted to look better on the beach to impress girls but got pressured into doing squats. 

The term good form itself is such an amorphous term and honestly it doesn't mean what most of you think it does. No one constantly keeps "good form". Powerlifters who live and breath the squat still constantly get injured doing light weights despite knowing damn well what "good form" is. It's just a part of the sport, any sport really. And that's fine if you're a powerlifter/olifter. It's your sport and you have to squat. No question there. But when it comes to the average noob on /r/fitness who wants to not be skinny, that concept changes.

The thing that people are overlooking is that squats require a good deal of mobility. Something that many beginners and just people in general in the western world lack. I'm not even talking about stuff like mild dorsiflexion issues, I'm talking full blown postural issues that require time to fix (and don't get me started on the variations required in the squat from anthropomorphic differences you see among people). And the vast majority don't bother.

So is your doctor right? Well sort of. Squats can be done with minimal risk in perfect conditions. But those perfect conditions don't exist in the real world. There is always a risk doing squats and that risk is far greater than most other exercises. It's up to you for whether that risk is worth it. If you have good proportions, mobility, and you compete, then obviously yes you should squat. If you're an athlete looking to improve your performance, then yeah you probably should, squats are a fantastic movement. If you're an average gym goer whose goals are to look like brad pitt from whatever that fucking movie is people always talk about, then honestly I would say you don't need to squat.

Your doctor doesn't make a habit of seeing healthy people, he or she sees people who are damaged. Squats, if performed with bad form, preexisting conditions, more weight than you can handle, too soon after an injury, etc. *can* fuck you up pretty good. That's not to say they will for the large majority of lifters who do their research and use good form, patience, etc, but if your doc has seen a dozen people who where hurt by squats, she or he will have a bias. |-|

|-| cnvochy || 3 || It becomes a habit. Working out isn't something you have to get motivated for, it's just something you do. Getting started is the hard part. I was big into Fitocracy in my early days, I think that really helped get me started. |-|

|-| cnvomd8 || 14 || When I was young, my dad had me playing on 2-3 hockey teams per year. Shit was insane, the scheduling conflicts were ridiculous, I'd go from game 1 with team A immediately to game 2 with team B then go late to a practice with team C. I think he really wanted me to go to the NHL or some shit, I actually suck at hockey. I played with Patrick Kane when we were kids and it was really obvious when he was like 10 that he was going to the NHL; I had no chance.


Anyways, that put it some good habits for fitness in my opinion. My dad made hockey/training something that "had" to be done. When I no longer enjoyed hockey, I just found other athletic disciplines. Eventually I realized I just like lifting weights. I like being strong, flexible, and acrobatic. 


Lifting, as in following Oly/powerlifting programs, has changed me physically and mentally. Part of it, at least for me, is how it's enhanced my resolve and fortitude. I also have accomplished physical feats most men cannot do, and will not accomplish within their lifetimes. That sounds arrogant, but I used to have serious self-confidence issues; I didn't just wake up and move a ton of weight, I've sweated for it and it feels good to move more weight. And I'm not going to lie, the first time a woman really got into my muscles while we were fucking also inspired me. 

I think a man needs to be following an athletic discipline, a creative discipline, and an intellectual discipline at all times. Otherwise you're wasting time. |-| 
|-| cnvorbk || 8 || I went to the doctor back in August because of knee pain from squatting. He said it wasn't great for the knees, but he didn't say it was a bad exercise. He actually kind of got excited and told me about how he and his roommate back in college got really into lifting and he gave me some pointers about my form and whatnot. Turns out, the arches of my feet are kinda poo and that leads to my knees taking more stress than normal during squats. Thinks are getting better thanks to Physical Therapy though.  |-| 
|-| cnvowh0 || 7 || I've always hated my body. I was always too skinny, and I have scoliosis and Sprengel's so I always looked really awkward.

|-| cnvp4ux || 3 || I just have a shit ton of energy to burn is sort of what I've observed. I'm competitive, work in the fitness/sport realm so when im instructing others, I sure as hell better look like I can get on that line too. That was always something I hated growing up.

Otherwise, like a lot of people have mentioned - it becomes a habit. I can feel the difference tremendously when I'm starting to skip working out. |-| 
|-| cnvp60w || 24 || It's pretty simple.  I want to be fit/aesthetic, I know what I need to do achieve it, so I make time and effort for it.

You want it, but you want other things more. 

&gt;After I got home, I ate, watched some YouTube, talked to my GF on the phone and.....did not go to the gym.

1. Work

2. Eating

|-| cnvp7jh || 3 || I got lucky and got a high end scale for Xmas this year, but this is spot on. My cut has accelerated considerably ever since I started measuring out food instead of eyeballing it. If you want a shorter cut, or a more precise bulk, get one of these A$AP |-| 
|-| cnvp8o4 || 18 || Going to repost this response.  But this is the sole reason why I and many lifters will consistently lift.

"One day, during a particularly strong bout of motivation, I decided to write down a list of the reasons why I work out. All the reasons were well and good and in the moment it was incredibly empowering. However, when I was done I felt like something was still missing. No matter what I wrote, it still didn't change the fact that someday in the near future I would find my motivation waning.
Despite my best efforts, it is inevitable that I would eventually reach the point {where i feel like im going through the motions and what im doing is pointless because it no longer fulfills or satisfies me}. Motivation is fickle, it comes and goes as it pleases and some days working out will make all the sense in the world. All your reasons will be perfectly clear and you will understand them on an emotional level that transcends simple logic. Then, there will be days where no amount of logic can overcome that feeling of "but what's the point". You can read off all those reasons you listed when feeling motivated and know logically that you should work out, but that empowering connection you previously had can be totally lost. The logic simply falls flat.
So what to do then?
For me, I had to add one final note to my list. One final "reason" for working out that would speak to me and push me to continue even when all the rest failed. That reason for working out when you have no motivation to do so.
So what is it? Simple. When all else is lost, I continue on because I know that one day in the near future, that motivation will be back again. All that clarity I had before, I will have again, and in that moment, all those reasons that don't resonate with me when I'm feeling down will resonate again. All that passion and motivation I currently lack will burn inside me again.
Just as motivation will inevitably fade, it too shall come back again, over and over in cycles. And in those future moments when my motivation is at a peak and all my reasons for working out are clear, I will regret whatever I failed to do when my motivation had waned.
So when my motivation is at its lowest and I'm struggling to "see the point" of it all, that is what I cling to. I hold onto the fact that despite my current state of mind, I know there is a past me that had reasons and a future me that will have reasons. And even though I am struggling to see them now, they are there clear as day just waiting to be found again. And when they are, I will be thankful I stuck with it and dug deep and continued on even when I couldn't necessarily see the path. Or else I will regret that I quit and gave into a momentary lack of motivation (after all, that's all it is, a momentary lack).
This is the birth place of discipline and routine. They exist because motivation is easy, but whether you want it to or not it will come and go like the tides. When it goes, don't look towards your lack of motivation as reason to stop. Look at it as the reason to continue on, to prepare for the next tide when it comes again and you can enjoy the fruits of your discipline. Because even though you can't see them now, there is a point to what you are doing and you do have reasons for working out. When you see them again, you'll be happy you stuck it out." |-| 
|-| cnvp94p || 9 || It is routine-- and, honestly, it doesn't take *that* long to build the routine. You do it until you don't have to think about it. It's like brushing your teeth. You never decide, "Am I going to brush my teeth this evening?". You just do it because that is what you do. You brush your teeth. You work out. No decision-making needed. 

I will also add that I totally understand the "I don't want to leave the house" feeling and that is why I work out at home. I don't know what your particular goals are, but I do HIIT videos for cardio and bodyweight fitness. I have very scant equipment-- just the stuff I will actually need and use. So that is one option if you think having stuff at home will make it easier for you. It's only one less barrier, but for some of us, that is enough to get into a groove.  |-| 
|-| cnvpl6s || 18 || I have to agree with what's been said - it's not about weight as much as gaining muscle and getting in shape.  For those of us who are overweight, it's about losing inches - not necessarily pounds.  Muscle weighs more than fat.  Don't always focus on the scale.

When I started doing Les Mills Combat (HIIT, I can tell you more if you want), I lost 7 inches off my waist in the first couple months.  My weight didn't change, but I was in substantially better shape and a lot fitter.  That was with 30 minutes of exercise a day, 6 days a week, at home. |-|

Even if I never make it there, the results of training like it are wonderful. It's fun to race still and it keeps my body in fantastic shape. I'm happy to know that I'm healthy and am very happy when I look in the mirror and see progress.  |-| 
|-| cnvqeut || 5 || Whoaaaaa. Mindfucked. Im about to start my cut, been trying to research as much as i can before i start.. Then i see this post haha - i need to lose about 20-25 lbs too. Im 5'11" around 210 lbs. Was a bit worried over being late out for this.


Anyway, no keep lifting to maintain mass. Calculate your tdee, eat 500 cals below tdee. Do cardio but plan it wisely.  |-| 
|-| cnvqhw8 || 13 || * Get a dehydrator and make jerky.

* Crock pot that shit. Cut up some onions and put them in the bottom, put a pack of fence onion soup mix on that, set the roast/chops/steaks on top, throw a couple strips of bacon on top (optional), and I usually eyeball it but I'd guess a cup each of beef stock and water. 

* Get a sauage stuffer and make brats. I usually mix in pork to keep them from drying out, but that kinda defeats the purpose of the lean meat. I made some cheddar jalepeno brats that were pretty killer. 
 |-| 
|-| cnvqi76 || 5 || All about the food. Keep lifting and keep going cardio. 20 pounds in 4 months is very doable.  |-| 
|-| cnvqpj7 || 3 || Runner here. Firstly I enjoy it some people go for a drink after work to unwind, I go for a run. Secondly I used to be incredibly unfit and I'll do anything not to go back to that, everything is easier when you're fit. |-| 
|-| cnvr1uz || 43 || Well obviously everyone should be able to bodyweight squat, and be able to squat enough weight that they can do things like pick up a box of books. So everyone who is sedentary and doesn't maintain that ability naturally should be doing some sort of squats to build and maintain *necessary* strength over their lifespan. That's fitness in its most pure form, the fitness to do the necessary tasks that might be demanded of a human being. Being fit to live a normal life.

But squats with a lot of weight when you know you've got weak knees or with weight added quickly/recklessly or without attention to flexibility or with poor attention to form? Yeah he's probably right in those cases, squats can suck. |-|

|-| cnvrbr7 || 67 || - lifting weights to failure is what you are always supposed to do
- women should use low weights and high reps to not get bulky
- you have to do core exercises weights do not help with your core |-| 
|-| cnvrg3a || 6 || I go to the gym because I used to be just like you. I would get into it, get out of it, get motivated, get unmotivated. I got the bod, then stopped, lost the bod, then realized "oh shit I no longer look good shirtless" then worked my ass off for 6 months, then slacked off. New job = new excuses to not work out. Re-entering the dating market after a break-up = time to go beast-mode. 

My life was about reacting to the random circumstances in the world and at any given time, my body was just a reflection of the inconsistent, bitch-ass, validation-seeking state of my mind. I had become interested in ensuring I didn't look bad and ensuring I wasn't unhealthy. I had become about preventing negatives, not chasing positives. 

I know it sounds like a bunch of spiritual wuju, but I truly believe it: your body is a reflection of your mind. I remember how I used to look at every stage of my life and sure enough, there is a parallel to how my mind was operating. When I started working after college, I realized that I would need my mind to be at its sharpest or I would lose out in the rat race, I would fail to get the promotions, to take the risks, to stand out. And every single time in my life that my mind had ever felt "on", like my mind was on top of Everest and I was making confident, smart decisions, networking well with people, expanding my skillset, avoiding bad entertainment... there was a commonality. 

Every single period in my life where my mind has been in the gear it needs to be to help me advance in life, I was training hard. Every single time I was not making "gains" in my work, my social circle, my attempts to learn new stuff... you can be damn sure I was slacking off or flat out not going to the gym, and making excuses to whatever. 

I have no choice - other people I know get fat as fuck and still are killing it in their careers, and always seem to mentally and emotionally have everything 100% together despite their lack of care for their bodies. I don't. If I don't go in to the gym, it's back to shitsville. Not if I miss one session, but when I miss one session, what happens to my probability of missing the next session? I've fallen off the gym wagon enough to know that it all begins with the one day you feel tired. 

If you are like me, you are probably just not that motivated by fitness and reaching a "sexy" physique - you think that's something you want bad, but on a deep level, you don't truly want it bad. And that's OK. Find something else. I go to keep my life and my mind together, because I believe the physical and mental are interconnected. You don't have to buy that - find your own perception of why going to the gym is non-optional and cling to it for dear life. Cling to your rationalization for why you need to go in, whatever that rationalization may be, until it becomes a habit that you cannot live without.

|-| cnvt6jd || 7 || Technically, cardio (and just not eating in general) can cause muscle deterioration, but just beyond the point of glycogen depletion.  If you're just going for a low-moderate intensity run that's shorter than ~1 hour long, you're not glycogen depleted.  Distance running burns through readily available fat (and glycogen, obviously) before it turns to muscle tissues as a major energy source, so if you're just going to run 3-5 miles a few days a week, the idea of running burning muscle isn't one to worry about.  Just eat back the calories if you're trying to put on mass and you're good to go.  Also remember that you won't be completely devoid of all fat and all glycogen and still be actively running; your body just switches to the most readily available source when necessary.  When you've burned a lot of glycogen and fat (ie, if you've got pretty low body fat so there isn't much excess fat to burn as fuel), your body keeps using those sources, but they're no longer the *dominant* energy sources.  You'll feel when you become glycogen depleted, too.  Suddenly your legs will feel like they've each gained like 15lbs each.  Some people will become glycogen depleted sooner than others, though.  For example, elite marathoners can go on just a few sips of gatorade while running all 26.2 miles at ~4:45min/mile pace because they're good for nearly 2 hours, which is about as long as the race takes them, but normal people usually have to eat while running that far, even at a far lower intensity.  I'm trained and coached (and mediocre), and I'm normally good to go for ~1:20.

It's not technically incorrect that running burns muscle.  Metabolically, it definitely does.  A lot of people just think that any sort of long/slow cardio is going to put them in a serious catabolic state, when in reality, not very many people are exercising at that intensity in their daily fitness routines.  30 minutes of cardio would only improve heart health, and to prevent muscle loss all anyone's got to do is eat a cookie before running. |-|

It's that simple. 

We conjure up this idea in our heads that there's a right time for everything but there isn't. Most of the time you just have to say "fuck it" and do the damn thing. It takes roughly an hour to get a good workout, just an hour. That's 1/24 hours in a day. You can do whatever the fuck with the rest of the 23 as long as you get that workout in. I've realised time is a valuable thing, one second too early or too late and then the moment is gone forever. That's it, you're not getting that second back ever.

So in simple terms, make the time and make the seconds count. You either do it or you don't. And that's why I just do the damn thing, dedicate an hour to healthy living then the rest of the day is all mine.  |-|

Skip to 4 months ago. I was getting beat, I lost my starting spot on basketball and my first string spot in football. I knew that I may never be as good as I want to be, but I can for sure close the distance I was to getting there. I started working out to better myself. Whenever I'm tired I just think to myself, " What would happen if I gave up right now?". This has motivated me enough so that I can keep pushing and reaching my goals.

Exercise is to waste energy by moving. Training is trying to better yourself, your ability or a physical characteristic through practice; the distinguishing aspect is the measurement of progress and the continuous strive to improve over time.

A lot of people think they are training when really they are mostly just exercising; they are moving around, wasting energy, without getting any better at anything, nothing important anyways. They could accomplish the same thing by eating just a little bit less. |-|

**Edit**, To clarify for everyone:
Somatotypes are a THEORY from psychology that classifies humans based on their appearance. That theory was not only criticized from the beginning due to the methodology of the founder and his racist views, but was never even intended to be used in fitness. It is extremely outdated and just plain wrong. The fitness industry probably jumped on the idea to be able to make more money because people like classifications and excuses ("I'm quite skinny and have a hard time gaining muscle, I must be an ectomorph it's not my fault."). In fact, most sites still talking about this are doing it just to sell you something.
[Here's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatotype_and_constitutional_psychology) a wikipedia page on it.  |-| 
|-| cnvwp55 || 4 || I disagree with the other poster. If you're already at like a 500 calorie deficit at 1900 and you burn another 400 calories doing cardio, I would eat some of those calories back otherwise you're going to be super hungry. You'll be at a 900 calorie deficit which is a lot. Nothing bad will happen, you might just find it to be more sustainable if you eat back the calories burned each day. Alternatively, you can readjust your calories based on your workout plan (e.g. if you plan on burning 1400 calories in workouts over the course of the week, you can add 200 calories to your daily calorie goal).

Anyways, I think eat 2300 calories on days that you burn 400 calories in the gym if that keeps you at a 500 calorie deficit. |-|

|-| cnvxpmv || 9 || The top comment here (while not necessarily being wrong) as just led to a huge circle jerk imo.

Squats are a great exercise and I think everybody should be doing them, if you don't want to always be adding weight and don't want to be squatting 500+ pounds then fine, nobody expects you to be a bodybuilder but definitely everyone should be striving to hit a 1 BW to 1.5 BW squat. There are huge fitness benefits that it adds by strengthening your core and lots of stabalising muscles which you will not get by working out your legs muscles individually.

Also no person ever has had perfect form for any lift all the time, so this "perfect form" nonsense is just that, nonsense. GOOD form is enough and straight away I will argue the other "flexibility" excuse as showing that you are not Squatting with good form if you have those issues and it should be obvious to not be squatting heavy until you have those issues fixed (and you should be getting them fixed).

Honestly the top comment may aswell be, don't lift anything ever because you will hurt yourself, the way some people are reading it. Every single lift in the gym, every single run, every single time you lift something at home that might be heavy could also lead to a serious injury. If you do things right (practice your form, slowly add weight when you are ready) then you will most likely not get injured.  |-|

|-| cnvy57k || 24 || Me and my friend went to our gym last Thursday at 3 p.m. for chest day, the place was surprisingly busy for so early. I got to the workout floor first so I went about grabbing a bench and playing the usual game of find the weights. Which included getting 45s and CLIPS from the smith machine. 

Once I had finally got all of the weights we needed on the bench I started a quick warmup with just the bar while waiting for my friend. A guy comes over to our bench and steals a 45 as I'm warming up. He takes it back to the Isolateral plate loaded incline bench. Fuck you dude. I go find another 45 as my friend walks up to the bench. 

We throw on 135 and he warms up and I do a set. We throw on 225, he does a set, we go back down to 155 for my next set and another guy comes over as we are standing there and steals a 45 off and puts it on the isolateral row. THE FUCK. At this point we're not having it we tell the guy we were using the plate and he gives it back. "Only because we aren't revolutionist newbies" again fuck this dude, his Mohawk and house arrest anklet.

Fast forward a couple sets and we go to put 225 back on for my buddy, he puts his weight on I go to grab the other 45 and it has magically disappeared. We didn't even see the person take it. I turn around and there are now two 45s on the incline bench that weren't there before and no one around. The fuck. I take the 45 back from the incline and my buddy goes to do his set.

What is wrong with people.

Tl;Dr: had the 45s we were using on bench stolen three times during our sets.  |-|

|-| cnvy88d || 3 || The problem is not the movement, it is the person. The squat, deadlift, and bench are not just things you can enter the gym and start doing, they each require time and learning. There is a ton of mechanical techniques that need to be learned over time. If you never take the time to truly learn the proper way to lift you will always be hurt. To truly take the time to learn the movement to where you become proficient requires years of dedication. With that being said, if you start training the powerlifts, you will be injured eventually. I hate to break it to you, but every true lifter knows this, and those who don't can't lift for shit. Ive been lifting for a while now and even competed in powerlifting competitions and despite my attention of my form, tweaks and injuries still occur. I get regular chiropractic work and massage therapy due to these injuries, and on cold days like today my joints feel frozen solid. So yes your doctor is correct, squats will eventually fuck your knees, up. Most athletics will.  |-| 
|-| cnvy8up || 61 || This legitimately happened today. At 6 AM, before dawn, I went to the park to get some bar related exercises done. As I walked in, i noticed a bunch of street dogs howling and gnawing at each other. Nevertheless, i went for my workout, and noticed I'm the only one there. So I'm about 10 minutes in and chilling out between sets, right? I turn around and there is this big-ass, dark as hell dog standing right at the entrance. The same one that rekt all the other dogs a few minutes ago. I freeze. We make intense eye contact for what felt like an eternity. Logic sets in. Provoking this bitch is gonna be the last thing i do. If Bear Grylls has taught me anything, is that DON'T FUCKING RUN when facing a wild being. I turn my back to it, as nonchalantly as i could pretend, and retreat to the kid's slide, ready to take high ground  whilst feeling my manliness shrink a little. Dog's coming closer, when the other dogs start howling again. THANK GOD. Mothafucka walks back out. After ensuring he was no longer there, I prepare to flee and get my ass out of there.

Fucking ditched two sets of leg raises and my entire horizontal rows because of this.

You gym goers, y'all are fucking lucky, at least your problems are human. What's worse, I have to go there again tomorrow. Wish me luck, fittit.

|-| cnvy9s0 || 4 || When people talk about discipline i feel like some of them have a wrong view about it. It's not like there is one group of people born with discipline and one without. It's rather a matter of experience and learned behavioural patterns.

The human brain is motivated the most, if you do "work" (studying, homework, workout) and get a reward after (hunt-&gt;eat). For most athletes the reward comes somewhat by its own, since their body already knows the good feeling after working out and the beneficial changes in their body.  
But for beginners this is completely different. When you start working out, your body is suddenly overstrained and doesn't know (yet) how to react to this. Therefore the feeling of pain and powerlessness in your body overweight the good feelings, causing you to subconsiously not want to train the next time. That's why you chose to rather watch YT or talk to your GF instead of working out.  

But you can use the work-&gt;reward concept to your benefit. Don't allow yourself to watch YT or call your GF on days you work out, until you worked out. Use it as a reward instead, making you do it for an immediate reason (because chemical or visible changes in your body will take a little while). This way your brain will associate the "good stuff" after working out with working out, making you want to work out.  

After a while your body will learn how to adapt and therefore the feeling of pain and powerlessness will decrease. At some point the effects of happiness hormones that are produced while doing sport will overweight them and make you want to work out, just for the purpose of working out. From then on you'll choose working out over almost everything else. That's how you become disciplined. By learning to love it. Not by forcing you to do something you don't like doing.

Another tip is to search for a training partner or group, since social interaction and exchange is another big motivational point that some people really underestimate. |-|

|-| cnvyep4 || 8 || Worked out with a friend since a long time (he hadn't been going to the gym for the past 2 months and only went sporadically before that)

Anyway he told me that:

- you shouldn't gain strength too fast because your tendons and *bones* don't grow equally fast. Nay, "you should gain strenght slowly".

- protein shakes are bad, because "you don't know what's in them"

Besides that it was fun to work out, where he once benched 10kg more than me, now my work out set was 10kg heavier than his.

But what's worse is that last week when I arrived at my gym it was a total mess. ***Holy fuck it was so bad***. All the weights were lying all over the floor, barely anything was racked. There was a bench left in the power rack and in the only other power rack someone left a calf raise platform. All the safety catches were askew. Barbells were laying all over the place. The power racks normally have gymnastic rings attached but somebody thought it was a good idea to just remove one of the 2 rings and throw that one randomly somewhere on the floor.

I tried to squat but just looking at that mess from the corner of my eye hurt me, it was just a complete disaster, I cleaned most of the mess up inbetween sets but damn it who in their right mind thinks it's okay to make such a mess. |-| 
|-| cnvyih0 || 10 || I'm benching. 120 lbs, so not a ton, but a new max (NB: I'm a girl). The first 4 go up easy, the 5th... Nothing. I just stall halfway up. I don't normally bench with a spotter because the roll of shame is all cool, but if I'm obviously struggling sometimes people around me will jump and spot, which is helpful of them. 

That happened this time, only... Not. Another girl sees me stall out, comes over, hovers her hand under the bar, asks me something I can't hear because my earbuds are in, and then REMOVES HER HANDS. A moment of incredulity sets in before I give up and lower the bar onto my chest. She shrugs and walks away. Like, what the fuck? It's not like she realized she was gonna be potentially curling hundreds of pounds. I needed 5, maybe 10 lbs of upward pressure. I was just...stunned.  |-| 
|-| cnvynj4 || 3 || I could count on one hand the number of people in my gym I've seen do deadlifts and overhead press (not including myself). And only once have I seen a guy deadlift a decent amount of weight with good form.

Might be because they're hard exercises for example OHP is the hardest lift to add weight to. The other possibility might be that there are other, easier exercises to work your shoulders and posterior chain.

Most people acknowledge that squats and bench are great for building size in your lower and upper body. But at my gym, a lot of people do seated dumbbell shoulder press instead of OHP, and bent over rows instead of deadlifts.  |-|

|-| cnvypgh || 12 || I am an ACSM certified Exercise Physiologist and 3rd year PhD student in Exercise Physiology. Your doctor is incorrect.

Squats (with good form) are the absolute best exercise for strengthening and building knees. I cannot tell you how many patients and clients I've had who reported their knee pain disappearing after a couple months of squats. Anecdotal evidence aside, there is also plenty of literature on PubMed to support.

I'm not going to badmouth your doctor. But I will say that MD's,  much like PhD's, have their own little area. I have yet to meet an MD who knew anything about exercise physiology (even after 5 years of clinical work) and I have yet to meet an exercise physiologist who knew anything about Ambien.

When he does his reps he will do 5 reps in about 5 seconds, get up and wander around the room for 30seconds which is distracting as fuck because he gets quite close. He also uses this time to check try and check out how much weight everyone else is doing.

Once he has done about 10 sets of check press he will go on to shoulder press and do the same 5 sets in 5 seconds style for 10 sets then go home. |-|

It's the same everywhere. Guys who make $150k a year look at people who make $200k a year and ask how they're supposed to get by on such little money. Guys in the NBA get offered $5,000,000 contracts and ask how they're supposed to feed their kids because Lebron just some absurd amount more. 

What do you press right now? 100 pounds? When you hit 125 then 150 will seem really strong. When you hit 150 then 175 will seem really strong. When you're putting up dual wheels you'll wonder why anyone bothers coming to the gym if they don't have a plan to be able to press 275.  

How lean are you? Take a look at Jason Blaha's channel sometime and realize that about half of the people commenting come to ask him why he's so incredibly fat at 18% bodyfat.

While it might be true that Backsquatting heavy has a higher injury rate than other exercises, a type of Squat on which you progress will be one of the key factors to muscle growth in the legs.
Deadlifts don't really work the "mirror muscles". Most people going to the gym just want to look good. As for Overhead Press, it might be an ego thing.

|-| cnw08zi || 4 || Well, it's going to depend on the gym.

I go to a reasonably large gym where a lot of athletes train, and when the gym is busy-ish, there's going to be 7 or 8 squat racks full, 3 or 4 people deadlifing, 2 or 3 people overhead pressing, 5 or 6 people bench pressing, and a handful of oly lifters.

That said, I've trained at other not-so-serious gyms where it's not particularly common.  It depends on whether or not the people you see training are training for sports or whether they're training to lose a bit of weight or whatever. |-|

|-| cnw0rkg || 7 || It's only 8:30 on the east coast and i'm already pissed!

1. Walk into the gym at 5:30am to get my squat on; only one Power Rack in my gym mind you.  I quickly throw my stuff into a locker, run back out to the gym floor only to find some asshat giving himself a selfie photoshoot in the ONLY squat rack! This isn't even acceptable in a home gym.

2. I can't seem to do anything to improve my grip strength.  Mixed grip DL, I hit 330lbs.  Normal grip, I can barely hang on to 225!  I've been lifting for years but still maintain the grip strength of an 8 year old.

3. Don't give me dirty looks for bringing oatmeal to work while you're on your third donut and second cup of coffee at 8am.  And it's not powdered sugar on my hands; it's whey protein biotch!!!  |-| 
|-| cnw0tfd || 5 || So I was lifting the other day and I noticed a female bodybuilder. Cool, I thought. I'm not a small dude, but some of her muscles were bigger than mine. So I'm 'mirin while trying to not be a creep. Anyway, I'm using a bench and she's doing shoulder press two benches from me (so there's a bench between us) on one of those seated benches that are for shoulder press. She's lifting a lot of weight, maybe 75 lb dumbbells or more for at least 7 reps. My respect is mad high; then, after her set (from about shoulder height), she just fuckin' drops the dumbbells. One set had them bounce into the bench right next to me. I wanted to say something, but I was selfish and used the pent up rage to further my lifting cause, though I did manage to look over and shake my head in disgust one time.  |-|

|-| cnx4zvc || 14 || Greek yogurt doesn't have that much sugar. 6g of sugar compared to 18-22g protein per cup (Fage brand). I eat it almost every day plain or mixed with oats. More satisfying than a whey shake.

You can also mix in some whey and freeze the yogurt for 30minutes for some tasty ice cream  |-|

For a beginner of your weight, even doing 15 unweighted squats is challenging.

|-| cnx65bi || 38 || Greek yoghurt and PB2 (peanut butter with 95% of the fat removed) are a blessing when it comes to cutting and pretty high in protein as well.

1. 180g of fat free yoghurt (100 cals)
2. 24g of PB2 (2 servings) (90 cals)
3. 1/3 scoop of choc protein (40 cals)

I mix all that in a bowl then chuck it in the freezer. Taste like frozen, peanut butter yoghurt and it's less than 300 calories and roughly 40g of protein.

|-| cnx6hoo || 123 || Tip: If someone mentions an exercise you're unfamiliar with google "exrx (exercise name)". The result will be a site that has a description and gif of the exercise.

|-| cnx7f9j || 67 || Another tip - "Plain" greek yogurt tastes exactly like sour cream. I've had it on tortilla and buritos and couldn't tell the difference.

And if you can manage eating the plain 0% stuff by the spoonful it's 100 calories / 18g protein per 175 grams.

Edit: just wanted to be clear that I mean plain and not vanilla. I didn't realize there was a different until I accidentally bought plain one day.  |-| 
|-| cnx7gh5 || 5 || 150g of greek youghurt, 1 scoop of neutral/vanilla/berry flavoured protein and 150-200g of frozen strawberries. Add stevia/some other sweetener if you want it sweeter (I don't).

|-| cnxamo9 || 10 || I was/am in a similar situation with this. Anxiety was really effecting my eating and was off the gym for 4 months or so. Getting properly back into it and starting to feel good again, but in terms of eating I never felt like it even if I was really hungry. Sorry if this isn't great advice but all I've found is the more I've forced myself to eat the easier it gets. One thing I did was make myself eat slowly, taking breaks between mouthfuls and slowly I've got used to loving eating again. 

Don't feel pressure with not eating enough and losing weight, just think of it like being ill which you wouldn't be putting on weight during. It's something you need to get through and you will, just accept it for a rough patch and try not to be too worried about it. I do know that's a stupid thing to say haha, good luck :). |-| 
|-| cnxan99 || 147 || Thanks! As silly as it sounds, one of my new year resolutions is to be able to do a handstand on my skateboard. |-| 
|-| cnxawnv || 3 || My brother has UC, so he has to deal with bad digestion issues. He says working out helps, but only when it is in "remission". I would say you should focus on fixing this before you start working out, if it is really bad, I would speak with a physician. I had pretty bad digestion when I first changed my diet to gain weight. I wasn't used to eating a surplus of my usual caloric intake, so it was a shock to my body, but after about 2 weeks my body got used to it and I was able to continue.

This is the struggle of living somewhere it snows. I live in Columbus, Ohio, and (thankfully) this year hasn't been terrible as far a snow is concerned, but even the cloud cover can put a damper on motivation/discipline to go to the gym. Like you, I just had a two week hiatus from the gym. It not only gives me anxiety, but it makes me depressed. But feeling this way reinforces the importance of getting off your butt and just going! This is the struggle of keeping fit. If you want this to be a life-long habbit you have to remind yourself that there will be set-backs all along the way. This helps to remind myself that it is okay. 

You will feel better once you start working out again. It is because you are not working out that you have anxiety/guilt about working out. You may feel like you're starting from the beginning, but you WILL get back into the groove of things!!

This may not be very helpful for you, but I just wanted to reassure you to hang in there and keep at it. :) |-| 
|-| cnxb6qy || 3 || Depends on my goal for the day, as little as 1 mile exclusively for warm-up purposes, or as long as 7 if it's a LISS and there's something good on tv.

|-| cnxbn1z || 8 || I was diagnosed with clinical depression and acute anxiety years ago, and have been without ant-anxiety or anti-depressant medication for some time now (at least 2 years). I spent quite a bit of time self-medicating, which masked the issues but obviously did nothing to alleviate them (in fact, I'd generally feel much worse the morning after). I started working out with one of my close friends a few years back, but I fell off after he left for the military. Without someone else there, my motivation began to stagnate. Relying on a partner had initially made working out easy to get into, but it ultimately became my undoing. That's a big part of why, nowadays, I make working out a solo activity.

I started working out 4 days per week this past June, and it's been an enormous help to my mental state and general life outlook. For me, it's all about the commitment. I have yet to miss a day, which sometimes means working out late night after a long day at the office. But, that's what I need to do to keep my head on straight. This may just be me, but I find that establishing a fairly rigid structure is key to warding off anxiety. Get some free weights and maybe a door-frame pullup bar with straps for leg lifts, roman chairs, etc. Between free weights and body weight exercises, you can get a solid workout in 30-45 minutes without ever leaving the house.

I'm no stranger to digestive issues; I used to vomit in the shower several mornings a week, and I've had some ongoing (albeit relatively minor) GI tract issues. Between my past self-medicating and a medication I took as a teenager that turned out to be quite the tummy thrasher, I've ended up with a pretty sensitive stomach. Psyllium husk all day - you can get it at your local CVS, Wallgreens, etc. I recommend going for the generic - it's the same as Metamucil at a much better price. It's not a cure-all, but, in conjunction with proper diet and hydration, it's a huge help.

I hope you start feeling better soon. I'd like to share a piece of advice my grandfather gave me before he died. He was in his mid-eighties and on his second round of cancer, having already beaten it once. Despite the cancer and the chemo, he was still taking care of himself, doing yardwork and tending to his gardens, which he loved. It became clear that the chemo wasn't going to work, so he stopped of his own accord. His hair, which had been white/gray and thinning from the chemo, grew back thick, dark and - somehow - curly for the first time in his life. I asked him how he was able to stay so strong through all this, and his answer is something I haven't forgotten. He told me that he just does his best to stay out of his own head. The more introspective you become, he told me, the more opportunities you give yourself to focus on your perceived negatives. And, in turn, the more you fuel those negatives. It isn't easy (I'm still guilty of getting in my head more often than I should), but it's served me well. Good luck, OP! |-| 
|-| cnxbqy0 || 4 || i have gotten my handstand to be pretty nice, it's been a while so it probably sucks right now. i stopped because i notice that no matter how symmetrical my handstand looked, i was definitely more stable on my left side. i feel like my left side has gotten stronger. i also cannot get rid of a small arch in my back, mostly because i'm embarrassed to lock out my pelvis properly because it makes my nether regions stick out a lot. what can i do about my left side being stronger, i work with presses to hs, wall stands, freestands, wall hs pushups, and sometimes try to balance on my right side.  
  
  
is it possible that there are certain cues that i use for my left side and not my right? i used to have a leaned to the left hs, but i fixed that, still the left side feels like it is pushing stronger. |-| 
|-| cnxbrxh || 5 || I used to be very nervous about what people would think of me in the gym, or out running. 

I would only run outside when it was dark, and in a neighborhood with very little traffic. 

The more I exercised, the more confident I got. 

Along the way I read somewhere the following quote:

**"One day, you will decide that you no longer care what people think about you. 
Only YOU get to decide whether that day is Tomorrow, or 10 years from now."**

That made me think long and hard about what happens at the gym. And it would explain why so many old guys walk around not giving a care about what others think. *I wanna be like those old guys*, I thought. 

And then I read another similar quote, later on:

"**If you actually knew how little people actually thought about you, you would be very disappointed.**"

It made me realize that trying to please crowds or impress people with wealth, purchases, or external things is a COMPLETE waste of time. 

So now I exercise for me, my wife, my kids, and my future grand-kids. Nobody else. 

Keep at it, friend. You got this.  |-|

|-| cnxe0ch || 7 || DOMS come from novel input.  Once you're doing something consistently and regularly, DOMS are generally reduced.  You likely are more consistent on shoulder days and you're half-assing legs some weeks then going full bore other weeks.    

Also, I'd be willing to bet you're hitting your shoulders a quite bit on back/bis and chest/tries days which is either tiring them out or normalizing a higher workload for them.  This could also mean you're not able to push your shoulder workout as hard as you might because you've got two pressing days in a row.  Swap back/bis for chest/tris then you'll have a pull day between your push.

|-| cnxfcs8 || 3 || If you are working out at the gym and gaining at a slow rate, about 0.5 to 1lb a week, then you'll be fine. Don't worry about the fat if you're gaining as it's pretty minimal at that rate. Counting calories and eating at a surplus of 250-500 cal a day is a good way to bulk. As long as you are moving up in weight with your lifts, then you are gaining muscle. |-|

|-| cnxh4w7 || -3 || Honestly, as someone else stated, being sore shouldn't be used as a sign of judgement of a good workout. If you find that you've hit a plateau with your shoulders then you should try going lighter and higher volume. I see so many people in the gym going super heavy for absolutely no reason. 

I'm 6'2" 225 10% right now and I get people snickering at me when I do slow curls with 25lbs and front/lateral raises with 12.5/15lbs. I'd honestly say a good 80-85% of people that go to my gym ego lift and go heavier WAY more than they should. I'm not saying that you are one of them, but you may just be subconsciously lifting too heavy, which is putting pressure on the wrong muscles, and stagnating your growth. |-|

|-| cnxj2p3 || 9 || Personally, my biggest stall was at 185 for 3 reps. 

I had a slow down at 155x3x5, and that's when I switched off of SS to TM. I ran TM for ~ 1 year (progress was hectic, final year of my undergrad) and got to 185 for three reps on a good day. Couldn't match this more than once a month, so I bastardized a sheiko style program and just pounded more volume into my press than I thought I could handle. 

Six months later, I've moved my 3rm from 185 to 205, and I've managed to hit a double at 215, all while becoming a hell of a lot more consistent with it. I've moved onto something GZCL styled, and it seems to help me in getting comfortable with heavier weights more often. 

YMMV, I'm 6'4", ~250 lb.    |-|

|-| cnxtale || 37 || Everyone stores water in their liver/muscles in the form of glycogen, which is water attached to sugar. This is the body's primary source of reserve energy; when you're working out intensely and your body needs more energy, it will burn the glycogen. Even if you're not working out but just sitting around on a deficit of calories, your body will resort to burning glycogen to keep you going. The "water weight" that's being lost is the glycogen. Generally, only once a person's glycogen reserves are depleted will the body start burning fat as energy.

Glycogen is heavy. Much more heavy per unit of energy than fat, because of all the water in it. An overweight person typically has more muscle than someone who isn't overweight, therefore higher glycogen capacity. This is the reason why when starting a diet the weight loss starts really quickly and then slows down to around 1lb/week, because the body goes through the heavy glycogen first, before it gets started on the much more energy-dense fat (typically 3500 calories per lb of fat). |-|

Movements I have used to break stalls and keep the progress moving forward are; more OHP both lightweight high reps for about 3-5 sets and heavier weight low reps for 5-8 sets.

I have also used lots of behind the neck press, rear delt dumbbell flys, chest supported rows, rear delt rows, and of course eating lots of food mixed with more OHP.

**BE CONSISTENT** with these things and be patient you can progress your OHP it just might take a little while.

|-| cnxwg55 || -3 || Hi, I am a father of three young kids. i put one of them on the bus in the morning thats only about one block away, so thats a quick walk down the street. then i get the other two kids and walk them about two blocks away then catch the bus so that i can put them in daycare. now here is where the fun starts. after i drop them off i get (lol, have) to walk 2.75km back home. so thats a bit of exercise. now since i work from home, mostly on the computer, i sit all or most of the day for about six hours until its time to go get the kid one block up the road. then its back home. now for food i really just eat anything laying around the house, but i rarely ever eat out at a fast food restaurant. most all of our meals are cooked here at home, its way cheaper that way. ok, so from the time i was about 14,15 years old i was over six foot tall and always weighed around 135 pounds give or take three or four pounds. i used to weigh myself about every other two weeks or so. but nothing ever changed until i met my wife and turned 30. now im upwards of like 180. i stopped weighing myself because i just did not care. the funny thing, my kids drug out the scales from under the bathroom sink today and i jumped on it. it was right on 180. seeing this post made me think about the last time i weighed myself and i know it was before we moved into this house. we have been here for almost a year now, so if i had to guess, the last time (before a few hours ago) i weighed myself would be about 14-16 months ago. I really dont plan on jumping on the scales again anytime soon.  its not that i feel bad or anything, im not embarrassed about my weight, im pretty comfortable with it. im just not concerned with what it says.

    
    
tl;dr 14- 16 months or when the kids drag them out. |-|

If you are not drinking them to enjoy being inebriated, then look at these drinks as pop.

What does your inner health-conscious tell you about drinking 2-5 cokes after you lift?

&gt;your body focuses on metabolizing the alcohol and any muscle building is suspended. If I am drinking 2-5 drinks nightly, will this significantly impact my progress?

You are exactly right. The way your body sees it, every night you are poisoning yourself and your body stops everything to get rid of that poison, including muscle growth. Also if I remember correctly a lot of the side effects also inhibit muscle growth. I don't know the extent of the progress, but I imagine that instead of spending 10 hours a night growing muscle (sleep is where a lot of growth occurs) your body is spending it ridding your body of alcohol.

&gt;If I am drinking 2-5 drinks nightly

Just watch out man, I know some people that turned something as innocent as this as into full blown alcoholism after too long.

|-| cnxyb6q || 3 || Definitely Bluetooth headphones.  You can move between exercises faster.  No wires to be concerned with.  Arm band for phone, again to transition quicker |-| 
|-| cnxynto || 15 || Dri-fit shirts just breathe easier.  They're kind of bad for squatting because they're a little bit slippery.  Chalk is useful if your grip is giving out on various exercises.  Gloves are unnecessary unless your gym is very, very cold.  A tumbler is useful for holding your phone to record form check videos.

|-| cnxz1ut || 3 || Hoodie, wife beater/tank top, shorts, , shoes of your choice, phone, and headphones. I thought about getting a bluetooth headset but I rarely have the cord snag on anything. Usually have my phone in my shorts pocket, wired under my hoodie, so I can take off the hoodie without pulling out the headphones. I can see the appeal if you're moving around a lot with some circuit work or cardio.

I bring chalk on deadlift days. I have a belt but not using it yet,  I feel like my squat could go a little further without it. I also have wrist wraps for pressing heavy, but like the belt I don't think I need it yet. I'm pretty minimal with the gear I bring. |-| 
|-| cnxz9rs || 10 || Some people are really intense and say every day. I'm on the once a week side of this argument. Once a week at the same time ought to allow you to see trends (either weight loss or gain) without having to panic because of normal, day-to-day weight fluctuations. |-|

You can most definitely do it. I was about 330 lbs at age 23, now at age 25 I'm down to about 180 ish and became a certified personal trainer. If you're willing to play the long term game, I'd love to help you out for free on anything in regards to diet, habit formation and learning how to work out. Message me if you are interested.  |-| 
|-| co0fszt || 539 || Assuming you're serious about losing weight, I will tell you what you need to do. 

First thing to address is your diet. It is  undisputedly the most important thing while trying to lose weight. Slowly start cutting out sugary drinks/sugary snacks. Substitute healthier items for chips and high calorie content. 

If you can go to the gym that is great! You can find numerous beginner programs and you can move up from there. I personally started with Stronglifts 5x5 (http://stronglifts.com). If you diet right and do this program, no doubt in my mind you will be dropping pounds fast. 

If you don't have access to a gym, head on over to r/bodyweightfitess (can't link I'm on mobile currently sorry) and grab a routine.

Back to diet, if you are trying to lose weight, you need to eat less calories than your calculated TDEE, which you can find here: 
http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/

I recommend myfitnesspal for counting calories, it is a great user friendly format, and can really help you lose. Whenever you get hungry; just try drinking water instead, or eating foods low in calories that fill you up:

I can't promise you things will be easy, but this community will be here to support you and your journey. You can pm me any time you need to or have questions about anything. I'll leave you with a motivation video which always gets me out of the dumps.

P.s - sorry if my formatting is off, I'm writing this on mobile.

EDIT: I agree with some people in the comments on walking/running. If you can do the treadmill and 5x5 that would be awesome, or you can walk on your off days. |-| 
|-| co0mhs3 || 144 || Four huge beginner steps.

Only drink water. You going to cut out so many calories when you get rid of soda and juices.

Only eat whole foods. You can never go wrong with this. Vegetables, whole grains, beans, fruit, and lean meats are the way to go. Don't worry about protein shakes right know. You don't need them. 

Start tracking everything you eat. Find a TDEE calculator. Eat 500 calories less than what is says that you burn. If you haven't lost weight in a week or two cut another 500 out.

For exercise, I wouldn't worry about going to the gym. This sub loves strength training but it's not really necessary right now. All you have to do is walk. It is simple, you already know how to do it, and it will build a habit of exercise. Walk everyday. Don't worry about the speed at first. Just focus on going for a longer walk each day.

Also take some picture of yourself so you can show everyone how much you have improved. You might not want to now but is great to look back and see how much you have improved. |-| 
|-| co0p1oa || 78 || So I'm seeing a lot of "Go, dude, go!" and "You can do it!" and "Good that you want to change!" in this thread. And that's great, and it's all totally valid. But I want you to hear this, too. 

&gt;A piece of advice: don't tell people that you are changing your diet or exercising more. Don't tell them that your goal is to lose 100+ lbs.
Studies show that people who talk about their intentions are less likely to accomplish them. Just let them notice themselves after you get results.

I noticed you didn't respond to this. Read it. Now read it again. 

Threads like this with massive response *feel* really good. Everyone's proud of me! I'm doing the right thing by wanting to change!

**Remember that you haven't done anything yet.** 

The reason that /u/Jonas223XC told you not to talk about your goals is the same reason that threads like this are a mixed blessing. When people say "I'm going to do this great thing!" the community around them tends to respond with a wave of overwhelming support. And that feels really good. 

It feels so good **your brain can trick you** into thinking you've already achieved the reward you're striving for. 

You haven't. You haven't done anything. Right now, those fuzzy feelings are a lie. 

So don't talk about what you're *going* to do. Just get to work, and when you have results, talk about what you've *done*. |-|

|-| co0fqub || 583 || First and foremost, I congratulate you OP. You have taken the first crucial step to fitness: admitting you have a problem. Most people will never admit this. 

Read the FAQ. There is lots of info there. I understand your insecurities with the gym and I'm not gonna be one of the douches to say stop being a pussy. One step at a time. First, focus on getting your diet in check. You can lose weight without going to the gym. First however, I'd say to start making little changes in your diet. You make more and more little changes that'll eventually compound to a huge change. Get that aspect down FIRST. Then when you start gaining momentum, you'll probably have a bit more confidence, but any insecurities you have will need to take a back seat. You just need to start going to the gym. 

I know it doesn't help you to hear that people generally don't give two shits to see you at the gym or not, but it's true. As Nike said, JUST DO IT. 

Also, please, PLEASE PM me if you have any questions whatsoever. I'd be more than happy to answer them for you. I want to help you because you have the right attitude, and I can tell who is serious and who isn't. HATE your body. Be disgusted by it. Do something about it.  |-| 
|-| co0fp1p || 21 || Start tracking your calories, eat at a deficit, your bodyfat percentage is high so you could maintain a higher deficit without  losing a lot of muscle, do some sort of cardio 3 days a week (read: walking) and lift some heavy ass weights. 

It will take about 2 years but you'll feel a lot better at the end. JUST DO IT.

|-| co0fmkw || 36 || Every journey begins with a single step. Remember that. Life is about going out into the world and creating meaningful experiences that you will keep with you forever. Sitting in front of a tv all day wont do that. First step on your journey, should be to take that first step. Literally. Start walking. Everyday. Buy yourself a pedometer and work your way up to 10,000 steps per day. That should be goal number one. Just to get your body used to regular movement again. And when you get confident enough, start taking the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator, walking somewhere you otherwise would have taken a car to get to etc. Also start cleaning up your diet. You will be surprised at how much weight can be lost just by eating healthy. Lots of fresh fruits and veggies, lean proteins, healthy fats, whole grains. And find ways to make them taste good (without ketchup or other fattening dressing or condiments). Google will be your friend for that one. I wouldn't bother with protein shakes until you get to the point where your lifting weights or doing actually workouts after you progressed beyond walking. And even then, as long as your body is getting enough protein you dont really need a shake. So you dont have to worry about choking them down. That should give you a pretty solid start. Also, enjoy the journey. This should be an exciting and rewarding experience for you. Do things that are fun with people you love. Go for bike rides, play soccer or basketball with your friends, whatever activity you enjoy and have fun with. The more active you are the better off you will be. And most importantly, dont be afraid of what others think. Go out into the world and just be yourself and live life on your terms and be happy! Hope this helps! |-| 
|-| co0ltuw || 14 || If you do nothing else, remember this: Everyone who is in the gym, with no exceptions, is there to improve what they see as flaws within themselves. It's extremely rare to hear someone look down on a fat person trying to fix what's killing them slowly. Most of us have more respect for the big guy working his ass off in obvious discomfort then we have for the ripped huge guy doing curls in the squat rack.

Good luck on your journey. You've taken the first, and most important step, and you've done it early enough to really never have any negative consequences in the long run. Fix this now, and in 5 years the only memory of this will be a dedication to fitness and a shitload of muscles.

Remember that you will lose weight due to diet. You gained weight due to weight. But training while you do it means that when you hit 180lb you're muscled and ripped instead of thinner and weak. Under all that flab you are likely to be packing a bit of muscle, and you're literally in the best time in your life to build muscles. Utilize this.

|-| co0fv7x || 7 || Hi Brett-You've taken the biggest step by admitting to yourself that you need to address your weight problem.  You can do a few basic things right away.  Do you drink sugary sodas?  Those things are liquid candy. You could be drinking a thousand calories a day without even realizing it.  Switch to water.  Don't eat while you're sitting in front of a screen, any screen.  Walk more.  And don't give a damn about anyone judging you.  It's your life, and you've got to own it.  You've got people on your side. Please keep us posted.   Best wishes. |-| 
|-| co0pi4k || 7 || I think the most important things have been said already. However, your parents (I assume they buy the groceries) are probably a very, very important factor in directing your diet. For me it was very easy to just top buying chocolate and chips, but if your parents (and possible siblings) keep bringing that shit into the house it might be a lot harder to stop eating that junk. Obviously you should be doing the work, but it's not a bad idea to include your parents. I hope they'll understand, and somehow aid you in your journey.  
  
If not, well, you have us to fall back on. Also, you're very young, and one upside to not being skinny, is that it'll be quite easy for you to transform that fat into muscle tissue. You could be absolutely ripped by the age of 18, work towards that! |-| 
|-| co0mmo0 || 5 || I don't know what everyone else has said in these comments but i'm going to give out my two cents. In July is was practically in the same boat as you, i'm 20 and weighed 320 pounds, as of right now i'm down to 265-ish. So i'm going to tell you exactly what i'm doing. No carbs, period; no breads, no sugar, no fruit, etc. My meals consist of a vegetable and a meat (usually chicken breast, I usually have like egg whites in the morning).

When it comes to weightlifting, i say do it. When your muscles get bigger, think  of it as adding cylinders to your engine, you can burn me fuel. When it comes to cardio, start off with walking, I was running at 320 pounds, and let me tell you my knees and ankles are not thanking me right now. But if you do sign up for a gym try biking, rowing, or the elliptical, but the way i see it is some cardio is better than nothing.

But let me tell you something. trying to lose weight is just as much a mental battle as it is a physical battle. There will be times when you'll want to quit, but you cant. and you have to start RIGHT NOW. If you are not willing to start this instant your diet won't stick. If you say "i'll start on Monday" then you wont start. But some final tips i would is get obsessed with nutrition and how the body works, read everything you can and soak it all up. I also subscribe to [/r/loseit](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit), and [Obese to Beast](https://www.youtube.com/user/ObesetoBeast). And don't rush it, let it happens as it happens, there will be days the scale goes down, and days it goes up. Just let it take it's course

**Sorry for the essay**, but i hope you read it and get something useful out of it. good luck. And stop caring what people think about at the gym, confidence is something you can have you dont have to earn it. Feel free to contact me if you want some more advice |-| 
|-| co0mg41 || 8 || People have already mentioned diet, but i just wanted to write out again how important it is. One thing that might help you understand how out of sync you are in terms of diet is to think of the average day food intake of yourself before you decided to make a change.

White them out and make a list. Include everything you eat from small snack, sodas and to full meals. **I can not stress how important it is for you to make a complete list and not leave ANYTHING out in this list**. This includes things like cheese and condiments in hamburgers, sandwiches and salads because there are a number of restaurants that omit these from their nutrition facts. 

do some research and find out how many calories that is. Then use one of the many calorie burned calculators online to see how many you probably burn in a day. If your intake is lower than that number. You are not calculating you calories right, omitting foods etc. So go back and do that part again and log everything in its entirety. 

Your caloric intake is probably alot more than your calories burned. Fix this. It will be hard at first. You are used to eating this much everyday and you will fight yourself trying to convince yourself that that amount is okay. ITS NOT. If your goal is firstly to lose weight your intake has to not only be close to calories burned number, but it MUST be under. 

I dont want to be harsh, but you must realize that it is your own fault for getting to this point. It's Okay though. You realize you must make a change. So go out and do it. It will be hard. You will want to quit. You will make excuses to yourself. But you MUST push through all that. Diet combined with exercise will help you reach you weight loss goals. While this is a short term goal. Always remember that your end goal should be to be HEALTHY. This is your life and you sow what you reap. I hope you pull through. I always root for the fat guy at the gym and am seriously sad when i stop seeing some of them come everyday. 

Im rooting for you even though i see so many quitters. I may have found that most people can not see their fitness goals through to the end, but i am going to be completely happy if you can prove that view wrong.

|-| co0g05c || 4 || Hey man,

It seems like you already have all the right reasons to start losing weight and leading a healthier lifestyle.

However, you have to make sure that the other "voices" inside of you don't contradict you goal of getting leaner.  You're going to have to ignore and suppress any negative thoughts (like feeling people will judge you) and just do it and stick with it.

As of now just start by taking a walk every morning.  Start at whatever pace you feel comfortable with and just walk a distance where you feel you put in a good effort but not so much that it's too much.  Do this every day and every week try to either walk faster for the same time or walk more time at the same speed (tiny progress over time).

Now the most important thing is going to be your eating.  Know that eating junk food is pretty addicting (I wrote about it here.. http://www.nutralance.com/blog/2014/12/22/the-origins-of-hunger) and that it makes you actually dislike (or like a lot less) foods that are healthy (blander taste).

Everyone knows how to eat healthy so all you have to do is do it.  Either learn how to cook good healthy recipes or get someone to cook good food for you.  Eating well doesn't mean you have to eat food that tastes like shit.

Start every day by eating a good breakfast.  If your first meal of the day is junk then it will spread onto all your other meals.  Similarly, if you start by eating a good breakfast you will be primed to keep eating well the rest of the day.  And the more days in a row that you eat well the more likely you are to keep doing it.

NEVER eat if you're not actually hungry and NEVER eat until you're too full.  It should always like like this: hungry--&gt;eat food--&gt;feel satiated--&gt;get hungry again--etc...

You'll be surprised at how easy it is to get a great healthy body you feel unashamed of once you actually get started.  Plenty of people have done this before you so don't make it something overwhelming in your head.  And remember that it's all about the little things that add up over time.

How tall are you btw? |-| 
|-| co0jj7l || 4 || &gt; I know I won't have a problem changing eating habits

Really? That is a great attitude but... if you're serious, can you get on MyFitnessPal or a similar site (or get an app for your phone, more portable) right now and put in what you ate yesterday and the day before, what you've already eaten today, and start trying to build a healthy diet that (a) consistent with weight loss, (b) meets all your other nutritional goals, including protein, (c) doesn't cause intense hunger, and (d) is actually possible to stick to, day after day?

&gt; I hate the feeling of being watched

That sucks. Because you really could use exercise. You actually have a weird advantage over people who are in better shape... you can lose fat faster than you lose weight because your underdeveloped muscles will slurp up all the energy in your bloodstream while your fat cells are still saying "Um, you know, we're kind of full, check again later." 

But at your weight the easiest way to exercise is probably walking at 2-4 mph on a treadmill with a maximum incline, which you probably don't have at home, right?

Things like doing push-ups against the wall (or whatever other modified strength exercises you are capable of) you can save for home, but you can really get a lot of benefit from the equipment your gym has.

&gt; live my life in video games

Do you play competitive games or more, um, ... freestyle games? Competition of all types gets very judgmental.  |-| 
|-| co0k7j6 || 4 || Hey man this is awesome that you decided to do this. I can't add anything fitness wise that wasn't already posted, but I thought I'd tell you that as a fellow 17 year old if I saw you at the gym I would think it was cool that you were trying to lose weight rather than judging you, and I think most people would do the same. Best of luck, hopefully you can update us in a couple months with how much weight you have lost.

One major thing I would do right now is only drink water until you are at your ideal weight. No diet soda, no juice, no coffee. Start this today if you are serious about losing weight. |-| 
|-| co0xl88 || 4 || Best of luck! Check out /r/keto too. It's what got me through my first 25lbs. |-| 
|-| co0xv26 || 4 || /r/keto. |-| 
|-| co0fx59 || 3 || Baby steps. Eat cleaner. Portion. If you're emotional and feel like eating stop yourself and find a different outlet. Do you have a tablet? Take your tablet to the gym and play some game while you're  working your butt off on the bike. Do you have a buddy to go to the gym with? Or maybe a parent or sibling? I'm sure you have people in your life that love you and want you to be healthy but the most important thing is that you love yourself no one can make you change your lifestyle that's all you. We're all cheering you on :)  |-| 
|-| co0j5sp || 3 || This was a difficult path that I had to walk at one time (https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/2dkl1i/was_recommended_i_share_my_story_here_200lb_loss/) but good on you for finally taking steps, even if this is the first, to becoming healthier. If you need any advice/help/need someone to talk to, feel free to message me anytime. The other people here have given solid advice, and the sidebar with the FAQ is also very solid as well. Good luck =) |-| 
|-| co0m3zg || 3 || Don't be afraid of they gym. I go to a gym with a ton of jacked high schoolers and college kids, and I'm scrawny as can be. But then I realized. Anyone who criticizes me for going to the gym can fuck themselves. Most people will support you.

Making fun of an overweight person at the gym is like making fun of a sick person at the doctors office.  |-| 
|-| co0m7o4 || 3 || Hey Brett!

Don't forget to up your fiber uptake! I recently did and understood just how big of a difference that makes. |-| 
|-| co0mvr1 || 3 || My advice is to take up listening to podcasts or talk radio and go for long walks every day (at least an hour a day 7 days a week). That mixed with proper diet (low sugar and fat, lots of fresh fruits and veggies, no more tha 2000 calories) will result in fast weight loss. Oh yeah, good luck! |-| 
|-| co0n3t3 || 4 || I would start with your diet first, then hit the gym once you lose a bit of weight and get used to changing your eating.

/r/keto would be my recommendation.  |-| 
|-| co0nl10 || 3 || r/loseit is a great sub! Good luck on your journey! |-| 
|-| co0olxq || 3 || so you think its going to be easy to change your eating habits?

Get ready to be disappointed in your ability to do so.

I am not being negative, im being realistic.

you see, you don't realize it, but you are actually addicted to certain kinds of foods, and when you try not to eat them, your body is going to rebel for a while, just like a drug addict.

so be prepared for some lightheadedness, nausea, and extreme cravings the likes of which you probably havent seen.
this will last about 2-4 weeks AFTER you stop eating sugar and carbs.

if you keep eating them, you will have to go through the withdrawl again.

what are you addicted to? sugar and carbohydrates.

those two things probably make up a good portion of your total food intake, and its going to be hard as hell to stop in the beginning.

first, cut out ALL sugar.  this does not mean dont eat candy bars; it means read the labels on everything you buy, and dont eat the things with added sugar in them.
you will be horrified to find out how many foods you dont think taste sweet have a bunch of sugar added to them.
its done because they know sugar is addictive.

next is carbs.
no more noodles, no more potatoes, no more buns.

if you must eat bread, make it as full of fiber as you can.

carbs turn into sugar when they hit your system.  two pieces of bread act just like a drink of soda as far as your blood sugar is concerned.

you are probably pre-diabetic if not diabetic already, but this can be reversed with a healthy diet.

find a book called Eat to Live by Dr. Joel Fuhrman, and let it become your bible.

you will start to see the weight fall off even if you are not that active.

its going to suck majorly for a while, but the benefits are soooooo worth it!

good luck! |-| 
|-| co0omtu || 3 || You need to fix your diet. It's not actually that hard. Most important thing is to cut all sugar (soda and fruit juices), esp. those hidden in processed food (breads, yoghurts). 

If you want to lose weight, /r/keto.  |-| 
|-| co0r0p3 || 3 || Hey I just wanna say that was literally me, and life did suck.  Between end of senior year and beginning of college I dropped 80 pounds and changed my life (so 4-5 month period I did this).  Start now!  Youth and stamina will make getting back on track so much easier since you're young.  Also, help possibly prevent too much excess skin, which is the bane of many who lose weight.

Good luck and stick around, also check out /r/loseit for a real motivational group. |-| 
|-| co0wuau || 3 || Keto is the answer. Cravings dissappear which makes it easier to follow the diet compared to a normal calorie counting high carb diet. Also until you hit like 230 lbs you won't even have to pay attention to to counting calories on keto since the food you will be eating is so filling that you'll be at a deficit without trying. |-| 
|-| co0ybc2 || 3 || First of all man...90% of the people at the gym wont care or will look at you with the thought of "at least he is trying". The other 10% fuck them they are assholes and nobody likes them anyway. I just want you to remember that self motivation is key and anyone that discourages you is a douche and you are already a better person than them.

2nd! your diet...get it under control(to state the obvious). I may get flamed for this but venture of for /r/keto you never know what you will find there and the food is pretty yummy! 

3rd...you're 17 with so much time to change and everyone is happy for you that you are deciding to do it now. Always remember that for motivation and anytime you are feeling down on yourself look back at that.

this isn't a 4th thing rather than a life tip, just remember that self confidence is the best quality you can have. Always keep your chin up and never give up. When you drop 120lbs I want you to message me telling me you remember hearing about how self confidence was the most vital thing to success. Good luck brother! |-| 
|-| co10wjh || 3 || Please take a photo of yourself in your underwear every day, in the same pose/lighting/location. It will be the world's greatest and most motivational time-lapse!  |-| 
|-| co112ig || 3 || Dude, at your age, your obesity is hardly your fault.  But you are the only one who will change it.

Fitness comes with three facets: diet, cardio, and resistance training.  **Before you make any assumptions diet does not mean eat lettuce and starve yourself.**  Diet just means what you eat.  If you drink soda and eat twinkies all day, that is your *diet*.  It's a shitty one but it's a diet.

That being said, **diet** will be your **most important change**.  The obvious answer is to eat less calories.  However, the trick to eating less calories is realizing what you can live without.  Clearly you haven't been going through each day and consciously thinking "Hmm, I want to gain some weight, so I am going to eat more today."  *No*, you think "I am hungry and this is what makes me stop feeling hungry." and you go about your day, eating whatever it is that you eat.

---

**Remove** these from your diet:

1. **Cigarettes.**  I don't think you smoke, but this is worse than anything else.
2. **Soda.** This shit is the absolute worst thing for keeping your weight down.  It doesn't fill you up, so you can eat enough calories, and then drink a soda on top of that and not really notice.  **Juice** or any sugary drinks are actually pretty similar to soda.

If these things are out of your diet, you're off to a great start.  These two things should be hard, fast rules.  I wouldn't bend them.  As for the other stuff I'll list, there's more flexibility.

---

* **Sugar/simple carbs in general**: Crackers, bread, candy, chips, bagels, pretzels, french fries.  This is the way you gain weight.  You can eat a whole sleeve of oreos, or three bags of chips.  And it is an insane amount of calories.  Try eating the same amount of calories in chicken or broccoli.  It just won't happen.

* **So what can I eat?** Paleo/Keto diets are pretty effective at losing weight.  Eggs.  Chicken.  Broccoli.  Carrots.  Soups.  Butter. Maybe some berries every so often. I cheat and add dairy, because I like it and don't care for strict diet adherence, except for the cigarettes and soda bit.

At this point, if you're not eating simple carbs, drinking soda, or smoking, feel free to try eating whatever else you want to try.  Just make baby steps in the right direction.  **And pay attention to how your body *feels* and adjust accordingly.**

---

**Gym**

Go to the gym and do stuff that makes you feel good.  **There is no magic workout for losing weight super fast.** Just have fun with it. That is truly the best thing you can do.  Once you enjoy it, there is no stopping you. 

Some days all I want to do is go on the treadmill.  Other days I want to try to lift a bunch of weight.  And if I get burnt out and tired, **I leave**.  **Don't** do that weird self loathing "motivational" shit and **push through the pain** as people like to say.  **You can reach optimal fitness without ever being at the gym when you don't want to be.**

Good luck.  Message me if you like. |-| 
|-| co13j32 || 3 || I am sure someone else has already suggested it, but please come join us in r/loseit too.  |-| 
|-| co0mpo5 || 7 || It's the diet, man. Focus on that for a few months, before you decide whether you can tackle the gym as well. 

Personally, as someone who's actually lost a shit-ton of weight, I think your best bet is a low carb, high fat diet. Check out /r/keto it'll do you good. |-| 
|-| co0hkxh || 6 || Hey man. Congratulations on makings decision to change. At your weight, you can safely lose 10 lbs a month for awhile. In 6 months, you could be 260. In 1 year, you can be 220. I want you to imagine weighing 220 on your prom night. What kind of girl do you think you will go to prom with at 220 lbs? How about 320?

If you want to change your body composition, you need to do 2 things. Avoid sugary junk and count your calories. My fitness pal is a godsend for both. If you track your calories you WILL LOSE WEIGHT. It is a scientific certainty. All you need is a little discipline. 

Diet wise, my best piece of advice is to stock up on fruit, vegetables, and beef jerky. Every time you get hungry for a snack, start out with one of these 3 things and a glass of water. After that eat whatever your want. Y pull be full of healthy stuff and less likely to overdo it on the crap.

Fitness wise, there are a number of programs to the side bar. If you are too embarrassed to go to the gym, that's ok. /r/bodyweightfitness or /r/kettlebell is super awesome for at home workouts. 

You don't have to do. Everything all at once. You just need to get a little bit better each day. Today you decided you want to Los weight. That's a wonderful first step. Now it's  time to take real action. Download my fitness pal and start today. Then Take a picture of yourself and put it up in your bathroom. Set a goal and go for it.

It will be harder than you think. It will also be completely worth it. |-| 
|-| co0n0v4 || 3 || Out of personal experience I know it can be hard to get your ass off of the pc and actually work out. Maybe if you cant realistically see yourself starting going to the gym right now, you can still change your diet, which is arguably more important for just losing weight anyways(not trying to start an argument here, I know exercise is important to be healthy and fit). Initially losing weight might motivate you to take the next step. Totally not trying to make working out sound bad, I just know it can be hard.

So what I can personally recommend is keto. I just reached my goal of losing 20kg today actually and I absolutely love it. Just start by reading the information in the sidebar of /r/keto and if you still have questions, the kind people on the subreddit will be happy to help you out. |-| 
|-| co0ncma || 3 || Listen man, I'm 17 too and if I saw an obese teen coming into the gym I would be so fucking proud of him/her. You're doing something to help yourself and make yourself a healthier person. I wish I could say something to inspire you to workout but its all up to you and how committed you are. If you ever want to pm me questions or anything feel free to. I've only been at the gym about a year but I feel like a new man and maybe I could help you out too. |-| 
|-| co0nrax || 3 || This probably won't be a popular comment but honestly at 320 pounds you don't need to be going to the gym. Your priority now should be reducing calorie intake and cardio. Lifting is great and will make you feel and look good at some point in the future but for now focus on loosing weight. Correct me if I'm wrong but at 320 pounds you probably can't run for long, so start by going for long walks and when you begin to see the weight dropping move up to a light jog in between walks. |-| 
|-| co0p5b8 || 3 || Props on coming here for help. It takes courage to put yourself out there, even if it is anonymous. There's a lot of great advice in this thread already, so I just wanted to add my voice to the chorus of encouragement. Committing to this journey is one of the best decisions you will make in your life. You're going to run into tons of road blocks, some you will probably expect and some you won't see coming, but if you stay on this path you are going to be a stronger person, physically and emotionally. 

If I had to offer any advice, it would be these simple things:

- **Baby steps.** Don't try to change everything in your life at once. Take it slow. 
- **Be patient with yourself.** Don't count on quick results. Even if your body is changing, you may not notice because it will be happening slowly. Try taking pictures of yourself every 2-3 months and the changes will be much more apparent to you.
- **Be forgiving of yourself.** Don't get discouraged if you cave in to your craving for ice cream (or whatever your worst vice is). You haven't ruined your progress. If you fall off the horse today, get back on tomorrow.
- **Do it for yourself.** Don't do this because you want other people to accept you or because of what other people think. Recognize that getting healthy is the best thing *for you*, and do it because you deserve it.

Your health is your life. Don't let anything or anyone stop you from improving it.

|-| co0t6oa || 3 || Hey dude, hey bud, hey friend,
I was just like you. I felt all those snickers behind covered mouths that went with that feeling of not belonging.
I was incredibly overweight in Junior High.
It sucked more than a Sasha Grey vacuum.
Hehe.

LISTEN. I changed myself, and here is the core of how I did it, and hopefully this will help...

Two things you need: 1.) Motivation, as in a reason to start your journey. Draw from your emotions. Think, doesn't it make you angry that all these fucking people judge you because you're fat? Does it make you feel alright that pretty girls that you will never have gawk at you with disgust and immediately forget about you? (Don't take it personally those were just my thoughts when I was overweight, lol.)
Channel that negative emotion, that raw power into a workout.
'Tis exactly what I did, and I'm also a lot healthier emotionally too.

2.) Find direction. For me, this happened when I joined something called "Parisi Speed School." It is basically a place where you get a personal trainer to work you out. Just look it up or whatever (there's only one and it's in Pas., California so I'm not trying to like sell it haha).
I mention it because without joining a place like that, I would never have changed.
Like, I don't know what freaking workouts to do? Just tell me how to run and I'll do it hard, you know?

Anyways there you go brother. I never comment on Reddit but I do it now because I feel with you. Now that you now begin an epic journey. WHOOOOOO |-|

|-| co0unw3 || 9 || If you're someone who has naturally stayed at the same weight for a while, and wanted to start bulking (underweight/average sized beginners), all I do is eat what I normally would during the day and then force myself to eat a peanut butter sandwich with milk before I sleep. This way I don't have to constantly count calories and think about eating a bit more for each meal. It works very well for me, so if you're really lazy and are pretty familiar with your maintenance level diet, I would try this out.   |-| 
|-| co0nw5a || 4 || Something else that might be helpful is [Open Food Facts](http://world.openfoodfacts.org/). I found out about it the other day (and made a YSK [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/2tjibg/ysk_about_open_food_facts_a_free_food_products/)), and I've been using it constantly.

Could be useful to folks who are comparing food brands |-| 
|-| co0slrt || 4 || You may be aware already, but using ratios to make up your diet doesn't work that well as you move away from average size. It is unlikely that a person on 2000 calories needs 200g of protein, and it gets worse as you add more calories.


Most people are better off just working out their macro's based on bodyweight. eg 1g/lb protein, 0.5g/lb fat, fill remaining cals with carbs.
 |-| 
|-| co0tf8n || 3 || Here's an even lazier approach:  Eat roughly the same breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day.  As long as you avoid super high calorie additives like mayonnaise, salad dressing, etc. there won't be too much variation in calories if you keep the portion size roughly the same.

Then you just track your weight and tweak your daily meal until you are losing weight at a pace you can live with.  If you decide to have some high fat foods (probably a good idea since fat is an essential nutrient), you measure those carefully.

|-| co0vl65 || 3 || Decent overview but you don't mention vegetables anywhere. Vegetables are great if you're looking to lose weight. |-| 
|-| co0xhg1 || 20 || This is actually called "greasing the groove" and helps you to increase the total amount of reps you can complete in a set by building up the neurological pathway of lifting heavy weight, vs breaking down muscle tissue for growth. The idea is to do several short sets of, say, 5 or 6 reps only once you are completely recovered.

Per Pavel Tsatsouline, who coined the term: "Muscle failure is more than unnecessary - it is counterproductive! Neuroscientists have known for half a century that if you stimulate a neural pathway, say the bench press groove, and the outcome is positive, future benching will be easier, thanks to the so-called Hebbian rule. The groove has been ‘greased’. Next time the same amount of mental effort will result in a heavier bench. This is training to success! The opposite is also true. If your body fails to perform your brain’s command, the groove will get ‘rusty’. You are pushing as hard as usual, but the muscles contract weaker then before! To paraphrase powerlifting champ Dr. Terry Todd, if you are training to failure, you are training to fail."

EDIT: 3x10-15 or to failure or whatever with proper form and short rest between sets will help with hypertrophy for your lats. Greasing the groove will increase the total of reps you can complete in one max out set. |-|

Edit: link: http://www.roguefitness.com/the-ohio-bar and specs/cost above are incorrect. 190k tensile strength and $365 for the chrome finish. Black zinc is nice too, my father-in-law has one.

Edit 2: I found this link helpful in my bar quest: http://www.garage-gyms.com/olympic-barbell-review-shopping-guide/ |-| 
|-| co0i15u || 5 || Texas power bars use to be like 250$ and we're pretty much the best aside from the real expensive calibrated ones. I'd check them out, idk how much they are now |-| 
|-| co0naa1 || 6 || Cap OB86-PBCK $140 shipped on amazon. if you dont want a center knurl the OB86B is $120. search around, best budget bar and better than a lot of $200+ bars. |-| 
|-| co0k1r5 || 5 || If you are ok with a 45# power bar (you didn't specify if you use kg plates or are into olympic lifts), I'm very pleased with the Cap OB-86PB I purchased on Amazon for about $160 shipped. If you are on a budget, is the cheapest 1,500# test bar I could find--by far. Knurling is perfect and it works well for my uses (squat, bench, dead, row...even some power cleans).

As you said, the olympic standard is 44.1#/20kg...and this one is 45# according to the cap website. I use kg plates and obviously the one extra pound hasn't caused any problems.  |-| 
|-| co0k4az || 4 || I own a Cap 86b. It is a pretty good value in a bar. Google search will pull up several owner reviews. They run about $150. |-| 
|-| co0oadt || 3 || OB86-PBCK from amazon ($140 shipped) or the Rogue Beater Bar ($165 plus shipping).  The thing I don't like about the Beater is that it's thicker than a typical bar; their Economy bar is $199 and is normal thickness.

The center knurling (neither of the Rogues I linked have center knurling) isn't that crucial for squats, it's a preference thing (note that I do personally prefer it).  Some people don't like their shirts torn up which the center knurling can definitely do - a better option is no center knurling and put chalk on your shirt if that's honestly a problem for you.

I wear t-shirts when I work out and don't really give a fuck, so if the back of the shoulders get a bit fuzzy then who cares.  But it can be noticeable (and a sign that the bar is moving too fucking much because I was doing it wrong and had to fix my low bar technique). |-| 
|-| co0fivs || 3 || Just buy any regulation barbell off the internet and weigh it when you get it.  |-| 
|-| co0fe7b || 6 || Cheater!

Nah, it's totally ok. |-| 
|-| co0fkfe || 4 || Could be a mobility issue? try stretching out more?  |-| 
|-| co0jbft || 5 || Do what works for you.  Sumo is fine.

That said, I had the same issue pulling conventional.  Even with light weights, my back never felt neutral, there was always a slight round before my pull started.  I was actually OK most of the time because I was strong enough to keep my back from rounding any more (my spinae erector muscles got fucking huge), but once I started pulling 90+% for more than a single, it started to get hairy.

I too tried all kinds of mobility and flexibility work (which I needed anyway).  Turns out I had to push my knees out a little bit more (maybe just under an inch to each side).  As a consequence, I had to move my grip out appropriately as well, which I was reluctant to do because of "increased ROM".... Which is fucking retarded in hindsight, because whats another 1/4 inch on my pull if I can start in a better position? 

As a final aside, I have short-sh arms, definitely short legs, and a pretty long torso.  Do you have a similar build? |-| 
|-| co0fcdu || 9 || Won't hit hamstrings hard pulling sumo.  Throw in some machine leg curls and pull sumo all you want. |-| 
|-| co0rs05 || -7 || First issue is that you think a deadlift is a pulling exercise. You push away the floor and use your hips. You need some coaching.

Another issue will be with your shoulders, you'll be letting them come forward as you hold onto the bar, which in turn rounds your back. You want to keep them back and down. 

You have to engage those lats in the lift as well - think of squeezing packets of sugar between your arms. This helps you keep good form.

Sumo is better for you because your shoulders will be in place.

The real issue, however, is that your body is weak and you need to lower the weight and work at it things in a smarter fashion.

|-| co0er3z || 32 || /r/C25K might help. |-| 
|-| co0flo3 || 30 || Run slower, longer.

Go look up pace times. For example, on Strava I ran a mile as fast as I could and did it in 6:54 mile. That time translates pretty well into the efforts they give below in their pace zones: 

A recovery pace is 10:43+ ( very easy )

An endurance pace is 9:13 to 10:43 ( comfortable )

A tempo pace is 8:17 to 9:13 ( hard to maintain )

A threshold pace is 7:45 to 8:17 ( very hard to maintain )

A V02max pace is 7:17 to 7:45 ( feel like your going to die )

Anaerobic pace is under 7:17 ( you cant do this for very long )

I just ran for 90 minutes at 9:15.

http://runsmartproject.com/calculator/ has a pretty good "training" tab that will tell you what you should try to run for endurance based on a max effort time. |-| 
|-| co0fd84 || 13 || So since everybody's advice will inevitably be "run more", I'd like to ask some guiding questions that I'm curious about and might help the OP. 

1. Do the same principles of progress in lifting apply to making progress in endurance and running? Things like caloric excess, periodization, sleep, proper recovery time, etc. 

2. Most lifters follow a fairly specific routine, should runners do the same? 

3. Is muscle gain as important to a runner as it is to a lifter? Since long distance running is more of an endurance sport, it would make sense that muscle strength and mass isn't as important as cardiovascular efficiency.  |-| 
|-| co0hk6h || 11 || You're trying to run too fast.  If you're just trying to go for a long run, which is what you're doing, you should be running at a pace at which you could literally manage to hold a conversation if you had to.  If you're running faster than that, you're getting closer to your anaerobic threshold than you need to be.  At your current state of fitness, aim to run at a pace at which you'd also be able to talk.  It doesn't matter how slow it is.  That's how you start running. |-| 
|-| co0o1hy || 7 || Fat guy here. The answer is run more often. My first mile I "ran" four months ago in 17 min. I kept having to take breaks and thought it was going to kill me. I began to go 1.5 miles a day. Some were good some were bad but my wife signed us up for a 5k and I'm no quitter. At month two it was like a switch flipped and I could keep going. It will literally just click. After three months I ran the 5k in 35 min. Not great but I didn't stop. Yesterday I ran a mile in 9:17 at 265 pounds. It was on a treadmill but I count it. Just don't quit and think long term.  |-| 
|-| co0nol2 || 6 || &gt; The longest I can run is for about only 3-4 minutes.

Unless you have any health issues your speed is too high.  

Start slow. Try to find a speed you can run/walk at least 20 minutes and do it 3 times a week. If that's slow walking, so be it. Always rest a day after you ran.  
If you found that speed, keep it until you can run it for 40-45 minutes. Then try to increase it.  

*Edit: Just noticed you distinguished running from jogging. If you mean "running at full speed" then i must disappoint you. It's not possible to run that fast for a long time. Jogging however is possible for a very long time, but more than 60 minutes is not recommended.* |-| 
|-| co0k6xr || 4 || You're running too fast. 

When I used to run I had the same issue. Slowed down, got further. I'm never going to be a marathon runner, but I did manage 10kph average for distances up to around 20km. |-| 
|-| co0fro2 || 4 || I just aimed to run for one mile without stopping. Took me a couple weeks. Now I run for much longer periods, but I just started by beating that one mile mental hurdle.  |-| 
|-| co0g4ux || 3 || How do your cardio sessions look like?  The simplest way is to add total running time to your sessions.

If you're doing ten minutes of cardio where you run 3 minutes, walk 2, run 3, walk 2.  Then just simply add another ten minutes of that.  If last week you ran a total of 20 minutes (in the entire week), then make sure you run 25 or so this week.

Keep this up over a few weeks and you'll be running a lot in no time.   |-| 
|-| co0j2zu || 3 || Slow down a bit and it will help you run much longer. Once your body is used to running and you can run longer+faster, usually in 2-3 weeks. |-| 
|-| co0kzvl || 3 || C25K - easy progress! |-| 
|-| co0n0tz || 3 || When you say "out of breath/exhausted", what do you mean exactly? Your vision goes funny colors, or your lungs burn, or what? 

It might help to do cardio on different machines until you figure out whether the problem is running, or legs, or lung/heart capacity. For example, is it easier to walk at 4mph on a treadmill at the max incline than to run on the flat incline? Can you jog farther than you can run? Is the elliptical easier than the treadmill? Is the bike easier than the elliptical? |-| 
|-| co0q6en || 3 || [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/2tmfwm/running_order_of_operationshow_far_how_fast_how/) is a current post on /r/running.  It is relevant.

|-| co0b3vc || 13 || PPL 6 days if you're an intermediate lifter looking to add mass.

ICF if you're a beginner or novice lifter who needs to get stronger and add some mass at the same time.

They're very different routines with different purposes aimed at different lifters. |-| 
|-| co0c50o || 5 || Prefer for what? You gave us too little details. But overall PPL is more versatile, as it's a template, so you can tweak it more to your needs - you get to chose lifts, tempos, volume, rest times, progression method, amount of days in gym (speaking of, I'd rather choose to do it on every second day instead of 6 times a week, but that's due to my focus being on strenght/power right now, which calls for some more rest days)... You can make it strenght based, muscle mass focused, hell, you can tailor it for far burning and conditioning too, although full body training would be better for that. 

So as you see, biggest pro of PPL can be it biggest con. You need to have clear target in your mind and know the methods that work best for it. 

ICF on the other hand lays down everything on silver platter so it's less confusing at beginning. 

My advice? Try both, see which you like more, go from there. Here's quite nice guide on making your PPL http://jacktylerperformance.com/2013/10/13/pushpulllegs-split-strength-size-and-athleticism/ |-| 
|-| co0cpmh || 7 || **Pro ICF:** Like SL 5x5 but with some additional accessory work, great program to get better at the big 4, more hypertrophy than SL 5x5, only 3 days a week which is good if you have little time

**Con ICF:** Workout sessions take very long, IMO a bit too long, quite stressful on your body, not optimal if your main focus is size



**Pro PPL:** You have time to work specific muscle groups more directly, shorter workouts (IMO it's easier to stay focused), more volume while somehow still less stressful than ICF, you can still train strength but have enough time to do more hypertrophy work

**Con PPL:** 6 days a week (personally I just do 5) |-| 
|-| co08und || 25 || Comparing a beginner routine with typically intermediate level programming seems goofy to me. |-| 
|-| co08vfr || 3 || The PPL I do has a lot more volume than ICF, so if you are going for size its the way to go. But the strength gains are probably lower due to how much volume you are doing. |-| 
|-| co0g5ef || 3 || I think a lot of times people get too hung up on choosing between routine X and Y. Just lift heavy-ass weights, dude. |-|

|-| co0gdox || 9 || Don't stress out. Make a decision and stick with it. You're far from "past your prime" or any such shit. There isn't a right program or a wrong one. That said, there's better ways of going about it than there are others. Start simple and keep it simple for as long as you can, there's plenty of time to make further changes depending on what direction you want to go.

Spend some time learning how to perform the exercises properly, research about how you're going to plan your diet and start there.

There's plenty of hope. It's not a journey you're starting, it's a change to your lifestyle. Physical fitness and health isn't something that ever stops... probably fair to say that looking like you're in shape is just one product of looking after yourself. |-|

I think the "right" program is one that you like. There is no sense in forcing you to do something you hate doing.  

The rest is a matter of experience. Just start with something (ICF for example) and stick to it for a while. After some time you'll get a feeling for what's best for you and maybe switch to another program.

&gt; I feel like I have very little time to get into shape.

|-| co0hz7p || 3 || Dude, you're "almost 29?" I'm almost 29. You still have plenty of time before you get to the point of no return. Your testosterone levels haven't really started falling yet. A realistic goal depends on how dedicated you're willing to be. Don't expect to put on 20-30 pounds of muscle in a year. If you stay dedicated and do it right for the next few years, I would expect a very noticeable improvement. |-| 
|-| co0og16 || 7 || I think the only reason why they don't recommend it is because to track results its better to keep things consistent over time.  However, I don't think there really would be much difference between the two.  And I could actually come up with reasons for person A to do better.

So in the end it's just about what you'd rather do and how you enjoy doing things.  As long as you're consistently putting in the effort you will get results regardless of the minutiae. |-| 
|-| co0wy66 || 4 || Only thing I could think of would be the increased amount of transitional periods you have from surplus to deficit.

|-| co0hcbu || 4 || I could easily do it if I wanted to, but I do take one shake.

Strickly protein here, it's 3 eggs for breakfast, 8oz chicken breast for lunch, shake post work out which could easily be replaced by 8oz chicken breast for comparable macros, and whatever meat I have with the family for dinner. That easily gets me to 190g. |-|

|-| co0vbd8 || 3 || 125lbs for your size is completely beginner level. No sugar coating that. You should be able to progress unless you have major physiological problems. Just make sure you're eating enough to slowly gain weight, lift with respectable form, and be fucking intense. I've gotten stronger from just TRYING harder. A natural with years of lifting under their belt are usually capable of 2x bench, and 3x squat or I was and I'm nothing special. 

Good luck |-|

|-| co0uwb5 || 7 || Eat less, don't worry about "not eating fast food" quite yet. Just start by drinking more water, ordering healthier options on the menu (look up calories online before you go so you know what to order), and not finishing all of your food. Think chicken, which is a leaner meat, and salads, things that are not deep fried, and mostly, just eating less. Get used to being a little bit hungry all of the time. |-|

I had a similar problem because my family ate out constantly (I'm also in college and live at home). But my mom agreed to the bet and it totally got most of the fast food out of the house. The beauty of it was that I couldn't really afford to lose and pay my mom the penalty so I had to stick to it. And she really didn't want to pay me any money.

[Try barbell complexes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmfS28JQR8c). No need to load it heavily, as you will fluidly go through 4-6 exercises which are usually performed with different loading. Even big and strong guys don't go usually past one plate. Hell, empty bar will make you despise it if you are not used to such thing.

I use something like that:

Deadlift into row into hang clean into front squat into (push)-press into back squat. It can be done two ways - 5-6 reps of each exercise then you go straight into next one or doing one rep of each, chaining it into circuit of sorts which you reapeat for set amount of sets. |-|

You know, when some curlbro is talking about supplements he takes to another curlbro and mentions creatine, then curlbro#2 is like oh how's that, and curlbro #1 says it's like roids bro . I remember telling some guy I was taking creatine and he looked at me like I was doing something illegal, and then preceeded to tell people " Dude that guy's on creatine". He acted like was on juice. I mean I am but you don't say that shit in public. Everyone's on juice. Silly. |-|

|-| co0utrz || 14 || &gt; my room mate commented something along the lines of that it's a steroid and he was surprised I was taking it. 

Because people like your room mate are not educated on what Creatine is, how it works or it's benefits.  |-| 
|-| co0vnlp || 4 || Honestly, with exercising regiments and supplements, people treat the subject like different religions. They bash others for doing something or taking something that is different from what their program does. Personally I think it comes from some sort of confirmation bias "my friend/gym teacher/trainer said to do this and it worked for them so it must be the only way".

Don't let your roommate get to you, just do your research and do what you think is right. The end result will show it. |-| 
|-| co0z68o || 6 || Tell them it's meat sand. |-| 
|-| co0w3i9 || 4 || It's just ignorance. For whatever reason the public perception is that it's some steroid that just bloats your muscles up with water. That was what I understood before I actually started looking into it and proceeded to break PRs all over the place when taking it. |-| 
|-| co0ydh0 || 5 || &gt;What's the deal with the vilification of supplements?

This isn't the vilification of supplements. This is people literally *not knowing that it is a supplement*, so they think it's a steroid. Consider the following sentence:

"Yeah bro, I'm just starting my cycle of [word I don't recognize, which doesn't sound like a vitamin]. Looking forward to those sick gains."

To the uninformed, this is going to sound a lot like a steroid. That's what I thought the first few times I heard about creatine, until I happened across an actual explanation of creatine itself, rather than an offhand mention in the middle of another conversation.

Fortunately, it's pretty easy to point out that creatine is *not* a steroid, and in fact it is present in normal food (mostly meat). You could get the same dose by eating two pounds of steak every day, but obviously this is much more difficult and expensive than mixing a teaspoon of powder into a cup of water. Make a comparison to fish oil, if it helps. |-|

|-| co0ie1o || -12 || Your caloric intake seems a bit high. I'm 6'0'' male weighing 200 on a cut and I'm eating 1,400 calories. I recommend calculating your TDEE at [this](http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/) website and then subtract 300-500 cals from your basal metabolic rate. I did it for you and i'm showing you should be consuming about 1,000 a day. 200 cals may not seem like a lot but it adds up dat by day.

HITT is a great way to build muscle while your body doesn't get "used" to the workouts you're doing. But a primary ideal behind HITT is to continuously mix it up. So while sprints, up downs, kettle bell workouts, etc are all great. Make sure you're doing different things often and make sure the intensity is super high. 

If you do HITT for 15-20 mins I personally feel once a day is enough. If you don't feel like you've done enough after one session the intensity was not high enough. It needs to be balls to the wall intense for 15 minutes.

Don't know enough about AWR to offer advice. But yes all weight lifting should be feeling it out. Set a rep standard and make he weight heavy enough to where your last set is difficult but you can still get it. |-| 
|-| co0guo0 || 4 || a big issue I see is what a lot of newer deadlifters get wrong quite often and that is trying to set the hips as low as possible and squat the weight up, what this does is it puts your shoulders behind the bar and puts you at a mechanical disadvantage. On the conventional deadlift, your shoulders should be directly over, or slightly in front of the bar, this will make your hips start a little higher, but it is a deadlift after all and not a squat!, another key thing to remember is to not let your knees track too far over the bar, you want your shins as close to 90 degrees from the floor as you can make them. hope this helps, good luck!

Tip - don't lower the weight carefully over your knees forward and back. It's also contributing to your form breakdown. Stand strong with it, then move your hips/butt back and while holding the bar, give it a 'controlled drop' in a straight line. |-| 
|-| co8q5nn || 169 || A pretty buff looking guy approached me during my squat-bench-row day of SL 5X5 and told me to only go to 90° on flat bench, not touching my chest. I told him I was following Strong lifts and he had never heard of it. This "tip" is bullshit, right? |-| 
|-| co8nadk || 195 || I left my protein shake on my desk at work over the weekend. I came in this morning and took the lid off to clean it. I've never smelt anything as bad as what came out of that shaker.  Everyone in the office ran away into meeting rooms and I was left to clean it out.

However, even after multiple hot soapy soaks, it still smells. I had a shake in it a little while ago and got a little aftertaste which is possibly the worst taste I've ever experienced.

Any advice on how to get rid of the taste and smell? Will it ever go away? Do I just need to buy a new shaker? |-|

|-| co8nb7o || 59 || Last week, I was able to bench 5x5 175 lb with relative ease but with a little bit of shoulder pain. Nothing too crippling, but enough to make me stop and re-evaluate form since I know it will become a problem once the weight gets higher.

I was already retracting my scapula a little bit but upon doing some research decided that it must not have been enough- when I went back to the gym today I really focused on squeezing my shoulders and digging in my traps to the bench, getting the arch, etc.

I was barely able to put up 5x5 165 lb, but didn't have the slight shoulder pain anymore. Is the drop in weight normal or was I just having an off day? I was under the impression that I would be able to bench more with a larger arch and tighter back. |-|

|-| co8oodu || 4 || Double overhand grip on a deadlift is going to work two things: the four fingers one each hand, responsible for keeping the bar from falling down and somewhat from rolling; and the thumb, which works to keep the bar from rolling out of the hands.

As the thumb is the weak point in this equation, there are many alternatives once the bar starts to roll: hook grip which uses the physical mass of the thumb as a barrier to rolling; alternating grip which has the four fingers of each hand act as an anti-roll barrier to the other hand; and straps, which keep the bar from rolling.

I've been told that hook grip and alternating grip will improve overall grip strength, since a deadlifter will progress with weights using these grips and their fingers will get stronger. Four fingers that can pull 625 are going to be stronger and better at anti-roll than four fingers and a thumb that can only pull 315. 

By this token, wouldn't loose straps (enough to prevent rolling but not tying the bar to the wrists) increase grip strength since the fingers would still be involved in holding the bar up? The few times I have used straps, I still squeeze the bar for dear life, so I know I'm engaging those muscles. |-|

RIP |-| 
|-| co8veen || 52 || &gt; So what is that?

A lot of water weight, even if you are hydrated. Your body is expelling it. You might be drinking even more water while sick, but you're probably less hydrated than if you were well. Your body doesn't want to retain much while sick...but drinking water is still critically important while sick. More water will help recovery.

The rest of the weight is muscle and fat. Even when you do eat, your body is not absorbing all of it, but again, getting rid of it as soon as possible. It's a natural defense mechanism to flush out bacteria. Additionally, you know why you often feel tired when you're sick? You may be sitting around doing absolutely nothing, but your body is fighting like hell and it's very tiring on your body. You're burning more calories at rest while sick than you do at rest while well. This combined with typically lower calorie intake and poor absorption means a calorie deficit.

Usually after you recover from being sick, your body weight rebounds pretty quickly.

&gt; Has anyone explored the merits of combining heavy lifting with salmonella?

Don't. Your body needs to get better. Exercising will only prolong the process of getting well. Rebounding is easy after the sickness passes...including muscle. |-|

When you're sick you generally don't eat a lot. When you don't eat a lot you consume less carbs. When you consume less carbs your body doesn't store as much glycogen.

Try and get in contact with someone in the athletics department about trying to get into your schools atheletes gym. With 25,000 students the athletes will have their own space. Say that you're aiming to compete in powerlifting and with the new rules for the regular rec center you can't train for your sport. 

Option 1 is all about making a scene. Option 2 is all about keeping your head down in a place you really shouldn't be allowed into. |-| 
|-| co96v9n || 21 || my gym has a ban on olympic lifts too but everyone does it anyways cus the only people that work there are students who don't really care. maybe try doing your workout outside of the rack and see if anyone really cares. they might not |-| 
|-| co9d0vm || 9 || I bet you go to the university of arkansas dont you. The gym is a living nightmare |-| 
|-| co9elrd || 6 || I currently play football at a competitive FCS school and I would honestly go for trying to use the athletic gym. I know for a fact we have had some (maybe one or two) guys lift either early (6 am) or late (5pm-close) who were trying to do powerlifting but could not at our student rec center. 

The two main factors a strength coach cares about: Are you trained enough NOT to fuck up the thousands of dollars of equipment and will you stay out of the way of the athletes. If you do both of those things and come off competent in olympic lifts, I really think you could have a shot. However, with it being Arkansas and not a smaller athletic program, I cannot say for certain. |-| 
|-| co9eob9 || 7 || If you're an American at a school with 25,000 students, they certainly have a campus recreation department. They also have a website for the department as most university departments do. Search the website directory.

Contact someone with a title of "Facility Operations Coordinator" or "Assistant Director for Facilities" or something similar.  Not maintenance. It's not a maintenance issue. Tell them that you think it's a risk management issue having the squat racks too close together. Offer to meet so you can express your concerns. If a number of other people do the same, I guarantee something gets done.

As for not being allowed to do Olympic lifts, that too is a major risk management concern. While you may know what you're doing, Joe Schmo coming in to get fit in the new year might not. He might try to emulate your workout and hurt himself seriously.

Don't contact athletics. It's not worth the time. They won't let people see the weight room much less use it. 

Signed,

University Recreation Professional

PS I'm really curious what school you go to.

PPS That's the creepiest thing I've ever said.

EDIT: Depending on the financial status of the department/university and the number of people that complain, you might be able to talk yourself into another squat rack if there's room. Space is always an issue.

EDIT 2: If they're dead set on not letting you do Powerlifts, see if they have a personal trainer that can "train" you on the lifts to be allowed to do them. |-| 
|-| co9ap7a || 5 || Random question, do you go to FAU? I'm a manager at the gym there and we recently implemented similar policies. |-| 
|-| co96aei || 5 || How thoroughly are they enforcing this policy?  Are the gym police going to yell at you if you just do you lifts in other places? 

 |-| 
|-| co9aj1g || 5 || HS and Univ gyms are always worried about liability.  That said, I had a strength coach so whatever he said to do I did, which included some Olympic lifts.  No one ever questioned me.  
That said you really can't do much about it, yeah you could try and get a petition signed, but the schools aren't running it as a business.  How much do you pay?  I don't think I paid anything but you may be better off finding something off campus.  Sorry, not the answer I think you were looking for.  GL |-| 
|-| co9ha0r || 4 || School gym employee here. I totally understand your frustration. We have 40,000 that go to our school and three squat racks. I have a some information and suggestions. 
1. Look into the Athlete's Gym. Approach the director nicely and see if you can maybe trade s a few hours of free labor or help in exchange for the use. That way he knows you're not a road monkey, and he's more willing to help you out. 
2. The letter to the athletic department, unless specifically to the athlete gym, won't really go anywhere. Reason being usually these facilities are separately run. Although they usually operate in the same building, the regular gym is paid for by tuition whereas the AG is paid for by sponsors, boosters, and therefore they got top of the line stuff. 
3. Change your gym times. Here's where it's tricky. Usually as of 10AM, the gym is busy until around 6PM. The best option which would save you most hassle is making the trek in the morning. Usually the place is empty and you'll have both squat racks to yourself. 

Reasoning. I'm sure it's clear, but we can't allow olympic lifting in the facilities because proportionally, the risk ratio is far higher. Since the facility is usually staffed by students with bare-bones first-aid experience, you have no proper lifting authority helping you with technique etc. Which can be dangerous if a noobie lifter ever tries some risky stuff. 

Hope that helps. Woot Woot.  |-|

If you have the time, I would also recommend some of the common yet effective body weight exercises like pull-ups/chin ups, planks, push-ups (military/standard) and burpees. 

Compound exercises are great because they require the use of multiple muscles just to perform one rep.  |-|

|-| co99wcz || 17 || You grind yourself down.

Your body seeks to repair tissue, but doesn't complete the repairs in time. Work outs hurt more and you get less done, and do further damage to tissues. You're weaker. Again, your body attempts to repair. You may sleep more and move less as you try and conserve energy.

YOu burn fat for extra energy, and you catabolise muscle in some areas to release amino acids to use to repair fatigued muscle in others. This back and forths as you strip muscle away but never quite repair it.

Over time, your strength drops, your work capacity drops, your body as a whole gets more efficient so you use less calories just surviving.

To an extent, where body fat can supply the calories and you ensure adequate protein intake and rest, you can do great things in this regime. You can get stronger AND leaner. But it's not indefinite, eventually you are going to have to fuel your body properly to maintain work capacity and recovery rates. 

Remember, your body is tuned for survival, not mad gainz. If you put it into a regime akin to famine, it will respond accordingly: It will strip away costly muscle, consume body fat, put you into a low energy mode through sleep patterns and fatique. It will try and live until times of surplus again. Put it into a regime of plenty, and you will get big, but also fat. 

It's striking the balance that is tough. |-| 
|-| co8zmxq || 11 || Your body is constantly going through muscle gain/muscle loss and fat storing/fat burning throughout the day. When you do not consume enough calories, the NET result will be more in the area of fat burning and muscle loss. 

A new trainee can continue with strength gain through a calorie deficit.

Someone who is overly obese and has a lot of fat stores can gain muscle during a calorie deficit. Essentially the body uses the surplus of energy towards regular body functions as well as building new muscle. 

...... I think. :P

Youtube some Eric Helms stuff. |-| 
|-| co8xl4j || 7 || You may gain muscle, you will lose weight.  Whether you get stronger or not depends on your workout, your training level and how deep a calorie deficit you're in.  Read the FAQ.  There is a study in the first section of some atheletes that gained muscle while losing weight.   |-| 
|-| co8uoss || 9 || Comments on the DL:

1) you are rounding your back a bit; becomes more evident toward the lower back
2) you can probably benefit from going a bit deeper into more of a squat position. From there, you can engage your hammies, glutes and hips a bit more to leg press from the floor, then use your lower back to straighten out. 

Edit: grammar  |-| 
|-| co8u43r || 4 || I feel like you lose depth on your last reps, first was good last was kinda parellel like you were scared to make the lift and go down ?  |-| 
|-| co8xgm1 || 5 || Deadlift:

As some before me have said: you have to be careful with rounding your back like that. If you're confident enough in your lift, a slight arch in your back is okay. But since you're looking for help, i feel like it doesn't hurt to tell you. Racking up weight on the bar might make you feel like a giant, but your ego will snap your back if you're not careful enough.

A true eye-opener for me was watching Richard 'The Ant' Hawthorne explain how the deadlift should be considered a push movement, and not a pull. [The Deadlift is not a Pull](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPtbHGiGCIU) and also [Big on the Basics: Beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ5rY_beDLY)

I.E.: push through your heels, and drive your hips towards the bar as you come up. Knees and hips should work the weight at the same time, not one following the other. Really get those glutes and hamstrings activated before you come up, and don't forget to tighten those lats. They could help you a great deal as well.  |-| 
|-| co93b3v || 6 || Overall it looks pretty good.  

A few things I noticed.  On at least 1 squat you go lower than parallel and you start to get some pretty bad butt wink.  

Also coming out of the hole make sure you are not shifting forward. |-| 
|-| co93awp || 6 || Looks pretty bang on. Only bit of advice I could offer is to maintain the tension across your shoulders by keeping your chest puffed up and keeping your hands as close to your head as comfort allows. This will cause your elbows to point a bit behind you as opposed to straight down which should relieve any weight on your wrists. Almost like you're pulling the bar into your back. I'd say it looks great.  |-| 
|-| co9hqxi || 4 || Butt-Wink is such bullshit. This form looks great. |-| 
|-| co9cpon || 3 || Really like your back during the lift. You have a bit of a wink at the bottom but it happens.

Those are really nice gloves, where can I buy some for my mom?

Edit: You're sticking your butt out a bit at the beginning of the lift. It looks like you're trying to keep your knees from going over your toes. You're doing a high back squat, so it's okay and expected if your knees go a little over. |-| 
|-| co9600z || -5 || Nice depth. But don't wear the gloves, man. Don't be that guy. |-| 
|-| co8wwun || 3 || The first thing that comes to mind are your heels, which are coming off the little plates you use to substitute WL shoes. You need to concentrate more on sitting back into your squat, shifting the weight onto your heels and working on ankle mobility. Don't go down so fast.  

The sides of feet are also coming off the ground and twisting slightly, which is a sign of weak hip mobility. Both of your problems can be solved by stretching more.  |-| 
|-| co9garz || 5 || congrats on your progress.  Any advice I can tell my friend who is skinny as hell and swears up and down he cant gain weight? I've told him to eat more and he's either in denial or doesn't know what real eating looks like. |-| 
|-| co9ce9z || 10 || Go to r/advancedfitness for a scientific answer. 

Edit: credible answer with sources |-| 
|-| co9fn7i || 12 || I'd ignore the other comments-the answer is quite simple.

Your saliva is a mixture of mucous and water, right?

When you run and breathe hot air across your spit, you make the water evaporate. 

Whenever you make the water evaporate, there is less water in your spit, making the water a more concentrated solution of mucous, and therefore thicker. |-| 
|-| co99g9z || 17 || Dehydration. |-| 
|-| co99qr4 || 10 || 1. all your water is chilling your legs. 

2. My thoughts, Your airways protect themselves from drying out by thickening your mucus in your nose and mouth producing more. More air coming in changes the physics of temperature regulation. 

Breathe through your nose at least some. That's what it's for. |-| 
|-| co9oea8 || 3 || Sympathetic stimulation, or a version of the "flight or fight" response (as oppose to parasympathetic "rest and digest").  Running gets the adrenaline and norepinephrine going, constricting blood flow to the GI tract and related systems to preferentially shunt oxygen and nutrients to the large muscle groups.
Specifically, less blood flow to the parotid glands means less fluid going into the saliva, leading to thicker mucous in your mouth.

Tldr; blood is going to legs, not spit glands. |-| 
|-| co99rdm || 5 || Try drinking a couple pints of water an hour or so before you run. I do this and can run 5-8 miles without a drink. As the other guy noted it is dehydration.  |-| 
|-| co9pflq || -4 || I am somewhat of an ectomorph and I love to work out frequently. What are some good supplements that fit my situation?  |-| 
|-| co99sc5 || 27 || Couple pounds over a few days? It's water, food and poop, not fat or muscle. But to answer your question, measure BF% and weight, and monitor lift numbers. |-| 
|-| co9de9w || 24 || If it jiggles, it's fat |-| 
|-| co99jke || 4 || &gt; Is there a simple way to tell if its fat or muscle?

Body fat calipers |-| 
|-| co9eyyr || 7 || ELI5:Jump in front of the mirror, if it jiggles its fat.  |-| 
|-| co98f5d || 4 || The most muscle that ANYONE can naturally gain is 2 lbs a month. Most often, it's more in the range of .1-1 lbs a month, but that's a good way to estimate how much fat you've gained. Anything over 2 lbs is likely fat. It's not exact but it'll give you an idea.  |-| 
|-| co98zeq || 3 || &gt;So I've gained a couple pounds over the past few days  

It's water weight.  You haven't gained substantial muscle or fat in that time period, you've just refilled your glycogen reserves and now you're carrying more water.   |-| 
|-| co8v47d || 10 || If you measure it raw, then use the raw numbers.  If you measure it cooked, use the cooked numbers.  The macros don't change much.  The weight will, due to water gain or loss depending on the cooking method.  |-| 
|-| co8tgam || 3 || Yes weigh it raw, less margin of error as not all meat cuts of the same food cook equally every time  |-| 
|-| co8xpmw || 3 || As others in this thread have noted, the water content changes from cooking (either an increase or decrease, depending on cooking method), sometimes by quite a bit. That means the macros will change evenly on a per weight basis. Using the example of rice, if you take 100g of rice and cook it so that the added water makes the cooked rice 300g, that means whatever macros per 100g gets reduced by 2/3.

Other things change, too. Fats in meat will often run off during cooking and will get lost that way. If you're grilling a piece of chicken, for example, plenty of fat (and a little bit of protein) will drip off into the flames (or, if you're cooking on a grill-like pan, will just run between the grates). Because it's no longer part of that piece of chicken, you won't be eating it. Obviously if you're pan searing something and then using the leftover fat and jus to make a gravy or sauce to consume, then yes you're ultimately eating it.

Also, certain preparation techniques necessarily add or subtract macros as well. Adding oil to a pan obviously adds fat to the dish (although the amount of oil left behind on the pan, as discussed above, needs to be subtracted again). Meanwhile, boiling potatoes or pasta might result in a bunch of starch getting pulled out of the potatoes/pasta and into the water that gets thrown out.

Certain preparation techniques might reduce the amount of sugar available compared to fresh/raw food (e.g., fermentation, pickling), or it could even break down cellulose (aka fiber) into digestible carbs. I don't think there's an appreciable difference in carbs between the raw flour and the resulting bread, but there will be a tiny amount of starch converted into alcohol by the yeast, a certain percentage of which will get baked off.

Certain micronutrients respond to heat/pH, too, but I don't think you're asking about that.

Anyway, that's why it changes, and it's different for all sorts of different situations. So the short answer is that "it depends," although once you understand what's happening to your food when you cook it, you might be able to get a better sense of how cooking changes the nutritional profile. |-|

Exercise aerobically by walking along a coast in 20 sets of 45 seconds fast walking, 20 seconds of slow walking or sketching. It is also fine to pace back and forth while painting a sunset. 

Every 3rd night find a lover, at which point you definitely want to do some kind of HIIT. I recommend 8 sets of 45 seconds ABSOLUTELY STILL followed by 30 second warm up periods and then 3 alternating sets of 2 seconds fast, 2 seconds slow. For the first 4 sets hold a plank, for next 4 sets I recommend a mix of hip thrusts and bench press. Finish with a final set of a position of your choice, as fast as possible. If this is too fast to be comfortable for your partner, pick a harder position. As you get stronger, it is wise to take on both a larger lover, for greater gains, and a more flexible partner who preferably gives tender massages while you discuss the effect Picasso's blue period had not just on art, but on the way that people are.

|-| cobdw0w || 1089 || Maybe they'll hire some people to clean up the database, I hate when people make entries with JUST the calories and no macros. No help at all. |-| 
|-| cobj444 || 215 || &gt;Con: Under Armour may potentially screw this up and try to charge money for BS features/database access.

I really doubt they'd do this. This is almost 100% being done to get into the wearable tech market. |-| 
|-| cobgrdd || 54 || I believe they already own MapMyFitness |-| 
|-| cobm3qi || 272 || I hope they fucking fix the fucking train wreck that's the MFP Android app. It's my most used app by far but the way it's coded is complete garbage. I have a Nexus 5 which runs all my 150+ apps perfectly but when it comes to MFP it slows down to a crawl. 

Switching to it via the task switcher takes 5-10 seconds. 

Performing any action has a 2-3 second delay. I bet those shitty ads (why the hell can't they offer a paid app??? I'd pay $10 just to get rid of those ads) are the main culprit. 

The stuff under Recent and Frequent tabs is without rhyme or reason. 

Oh and why the hell can't they add a Copy function that copies a food item (or multiples) from, say, Breakfast to Lunch??

MFP has helped turn my life around but I hate that piece of shit with such passion that I feel I'll get an aneurism one of these days. |-|

|-| cobpezt || 43 || So, I work for MapMyFitness/Under Armour and also just found out about this acquisition today. 

I can't speak about UA's plans for these companies, since I'm just a lowly developer, but I can tell you to look at MapMyFitness's treatment and progress over the past year and change. We've exploded in headcount, are currently upgrading to a new Austin office, launched a new product that had a major booth presence at CES2015, and maintained our previous business model, advertising structure, apps, etc. 

UA hasn't downsized us, or gutted us, or told us how to do what we do. They purchased us (and I assume these new companies) in order to become leaders in this space. They purchased leaders in order to remain leaders. Why would they possibly want to "ruin" one of these brands? This is a ~half billion dollar investment, and the most valuable part of that is the user base. Trust me, the last thing they want to do is make users leave the platform. Nothing's going to get ruined.  |-| 
|-| cobmaa8 || 15 || This sounds like great news to me. The android version of this app is absolutely horrendous, especially when compared its much prettier and snappier iOS counterpart. I hope they address this imbalance in the future.  |-| 
|-| cobkxun || 49 || I'd like if they invested in making the Android app not a pile of garbage, but I bet it's just gonna get covered in ads now... |-| 
|-| cobonqu || 11 || I should create an app. |-| 
|-| cobfew8 || 93 || I am super worried about this. 

They will fuck it up I bet.  |-| 
|-| cobnp5l || 5 || Honestly, Under Armour seems to be a pretty damn good company, so I'm optimistic.  |-| 
|-| cobs107 || 5 || It's a weight LOSS app? I use it to hit my bulking targets. |-| 
|-| cobklxv || 5 || I love MyFitnessPal. I just recently discovered the part of the site where you can type the link of a website that has a recipe, and it automatically imports the recipe, and then nutrition. Great tool.  |-| 
|-| coblkpr || 4 || It's probably misguided, but I have faith in them. Anything to fix the obnoxious "can't connect to the server" notifications any and every time I use the app. |-| 
|-| cobnnpl || 4 || Under Armour also owns MapMyRun, a much better running app than some competitors (e.g. Strava). Integrating MFP could be interesting |-| 
|-| cobmag7 || 3 || Well I'll be going to Lose It if they manage to muck it up, don't see UA leaving MFP as is if they spent that much money on it.  |-| 
|-| cobro54 || 3 || They aren't going to charge access for MFP. When a product is free, you are the product. They're not going to mess with an opportunity to do massive amounts of data collection and fitness targeted advertisement. Expect more advertisement. The MFP folks cashed out, and there's nothing wrong with that.. that's the idea of creating a startup ;) |-| 
|-| cobt4v8 || 3 || Under armor gains top spot in British version of my fitness pal. "How I lost 300 million pounds!" |-| 
|-| cobn2qp || 8 || I don't quite get the hate for this acquisition, Facebook spent a ton more buying Whatsapp and nothing much has changed overall. Perhaps it is just a business decision to integrate another health related segment into its mix? |-| 
|-| cobfqs1 || 12 || Noooooooooooooooo.

Everyone be ready to jump ship. |-| 
|-| cobl4m9 || 12 || While i hope they dont screw the app up as it is now, I do hope they make a nice under armour logo when launching the app so i dont feel/look super beta when a bowl of fruit pops up on my screen. I'm not "watching my calories" im making sure i eat enough, damnit! |-| 
|-| cobqqjx || 3 || did someone else offer $450 million and they had to outbid them? WTF this "app" had like ZERO revenue |-| 
|-| cobr8ex || 3 || If they do anything, I hope they make some form of verified entries that float to the top of the food search. I know there is variability in everything non-processed, but ~~some~~ most of the food db entries are complete shit I've entered some rathe simple things and based on what version I picked it could be anywhere from 70 cal to 500 cal. That isn't a trivial difference and can really add up. I stopped using the app over it. If I couldn't get halfway decent numbers, the whole practice seemed pointless to me.  |-| 
|-| cobver9 || 3 || Hah. I just signed up yesterday... too bad their windows phone app is complete and utter trash. :( maybe UA will fix it. |-| 
|-| cobh6k0 || 5 || I hope they don't Myspace it up. |-| 
|-| cobi4l9 || 6 || shit i love this site and it's done a lot for me.  they're going to fuck it up. |-| 
|-| cobn624 || 3 || Everyone is so pessimistic in here. Everyone does know that these guys sell workout clothing at an insanely high mark up right? They have absolutely no reason to put ads on this app when they can get a shit ton more money through clothing sales. Making this app better will increase sales through increased interest in fitness, I don't think this will be a bad thing. |-| 
|-| cobrpde || 4 || I really hate when people use both the symbol *and* word for currency. 

$475 million means the same thing as 475 million dollars. 

$475 million dollars means the same thing as 475 million dollars dollars.  |-| 
|-| cobnjit || 3 || Shit. I need to create an app.  fast.  |-| 
|-| cobn75g || -3 || Loseit master race 4 lyfe!! |-| 
|-| cobnh9n || -3 || FUCK |-| 
|-| coblzc1 || -4 || I never really liked MFP to be honest. I've been using mynetdiary and much prefer it. The few times I have ever come across things not in the database, they allow you to scan the barcode and the item and then it gets promptly (as in the next morning) uploaded. Easy to customize your macros, calories, and track your weight or other stuff if you want too. |-| 
|-| cob3enw || 177 || For "bulking" can I just get fat, or does there have to be some kind of muscle gain? |-| 
|-| cob4bli || 23 || Well this looks fun. I hope it starts up soon. The year was 2015. War was beginning.  |-| 
|-| cobbjjw || 14 || We will donate a couple bidet seat attachments.
I am personally down 28lbs over the last three months as well and will be putting up before and after pics to the sub. |-| 
|-| cobe6vp || 11 || If you are on the fence about donating a prize or signing up when the challenge starts seriously do it. 

It's a great community with other entrants encouraging you at every step. No word of a lie it changed my life, forming healthy habits and learning a lot about how my body works and what I am capable of doing with the right mindset!  |-| 
|-| cob90q6 || 9 || where can i see the previous winners, seem to not see it in the sidebar or i'm just blind. |-| 
|-| cobh0pl || 8 || As a former challenger, thanks for running this. I ended up losing150 pounds in 6 months and building a good basis of strength. I'm not amazing or anything but I'm a hell of a lot better than I was before I started. Almost 4 years and counting for holding the weight down. 
So if you are on the fence diverted in and enjoy your results! |-| 
|-| cob9ykg || 8 || I got into an accident and can't walk, but I do a ton of physical therapy like range of motion work and basic muscle strengthening. Can I have my own category? |-| 
|-| cob7v1q || 20 || I read the title as "if you want to donate pizza" and thought, shit, this is a contest I can get behind.  |-| 
|-| cob8bf8 || 5 || I'm in! I have a lot of digital marketing products, I'm trying to think of one that would be suitable... ill give it some thought and message you guys |-| 
|-| cob355e || 4 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| cob4uno || 4 || I didn't even know about this contest. Now I'm pretty stoked! |-| 
|-| cob8w7v || 4 || Aww yiss. This will be a good time. |-| 
|-| cobbq0e || 4 || How do I know whether I should be in the cutting or  fat loss category? Not exactly fat but the timing should line up well with the end of my first bulk.  |-| 
|-| cob696a || 9 || You guys live on 123 fake street too?   I didn't know I had roommates. |-| 
|-| coba3ay || 4 || How come there were only 2 winners in each female category but 3 in each male category for contest #7? |-| 
|-| cobcouh || 4 || Can I donate shoulder rubs and awkward silences? |-| 
|-| cobcvnm || 3 || This is a great way to start off the year. In my eyes everyone wins.  |-| 
|-| cobatm6 || 3 || I don't have anything to donate but I'm definitely interested in joining. I could use some extra gym motivation. I went from a rather physically demanding job to a sedentary desk job and got an extra 15 pounds to go with it.  |-| 
|-| cobb7uo || 3 || I think an immediate question is"how do we ensure contestants stay natty?" I sense it wouldn't be much of a competition if we don't do that.  |-| 
|-| cobey7a || 3 || Can people who are transgender partake...? |-| 
|-| coaypho || 233 || Bar is typically 45lbs. Go buy a broom handle or length of PVC pipe, get comfortable with positioning, high or low bar, and how you are setting up. Practice getting the motion and sitting back into your heels with a handle or pvc. I'm willing to bet you can squat an empty bar once you are familiar with the movement and setup. |-| 
|-| coaymvn || 57 || Start with dumbbell goblet squats. IMO they're also better for teaching form. |-| 
|-| coaxzu7 || 64 || Did you only try it once?

I've been helping my wife life.  She's just starting.  She's 5'3" and weighs about 105 pounds.  She couldn't squat the bar either at first.  Failed several times at first.  Took her about 2 or 3 sessions and she's squatting the bar with weight now.

Her issue wasn't that she wasn't strong enough.  It was a combination of Form and lack of confidence.  Her form would break down at the bottom (butt winking, knees bending inward, back bending over, you name it), and she couldn't get back up.  But mainly it was almost all in her head.  We worked slowly on the form, which I think helped with getting over it in her head.  Once she got passed that, she is golden now.  

Keep at it.  If you can, find someone that can help you and coach you while you are doing it until you get it down.  
 |-| 
|-| coaydxf || 92 || I'm 6'2 193 pounds, i was 280 pounds last year. I just started lifting weights and i'm only using the bar.

The bar is very heavy. Squats murder me!

I dont know how to help you but know that there is a dude out there in a gym doing the same thing you are =) |-| 
|-| coazp8x || 41 || Try using your body weight for a while and then go back to the bar http://neilarey.com/workouts/legday-workout.html |-| 
|-| cob0m5e || 23 || This strikes me as more of a form problem than a too much weight problem.  Squatting an empty bar (45 lbs) should not be too heavy for anybody, really.  I have seen 90 pound weaklings with toothpicks for legs squat more on first attempts.  Not insulting you, but I would guess that your form is way off since you said that you couldn't balance below parallel: not holding the bar correctly, not having proper feet placement, going too fast/slow, etc.  Or, you may be using a heavier bar without knowing.  While most barbells are 45lbs, some are not.  Read up on proper squat form, make sure the bar you're using is indeed 45lbs, and try again. |-| 
|-| coaxqvl || 20 || Oops forgot to add something. I am not doing squats to just work out my ass. I would also like to develop strength and make my quads pop out. |-| 
|-| cob10jr || 6 || If you're lucky, you gym might have fixed barbells like this: http://www.gymdirect.com.au/media/pics/site/imagecache/3/F/3F3792E55273187B1CE3DDBE9EFDFD4A.jpg

They start at 20lbs or so, which is less than half the weight of an empty olympic barbell. |-| 
|-| coaz07h || 3 || This is an off-track question but since I can't lift the 55 lbs (or kgs?) empty bar, is it because I'm not strong enough? I'm extremely skinny.  |-| 
|-| cob2ptv || 3 || Goblet squats with DBs is a good safe alternative to learn ROM and build strength. From there you can move to the squat rack and practice as time goes by.

Keep in mind, it's not a race...it's a journey. So be in it for the long run and have some patience. Keep practicing squating one way or another and it will build up. Don't be embarrassed, be determined. |-| 
|-| cob786j || 3 || http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2rkl54/want_to_get_better_at_squatting_do_thirdworld/

I've been following /u/lulzcakes advice for a month and I've been squatting exponentially better. Initially, I had to do less weight, but my form has been much better and my knees/joints aren't hurting after kind of resetting using this technique. Sometimes the simplest answer is the best. 

*just one month |-| 
|-| coaxn98 || 7 || Dont fret, weighted lunges kicked my ass way more than my 3plate squat ever did!

Onward and upward |-| 
|-| coayk4h || 3 || Oh this happens to me recently and more than a few times. I try to smile my way through it cause I admit my form is a long way from ideal. I can squat up to 75lbs but sometimes when I squat with only the bar, I try to go lower and there is this feeling that I got myself locked into that squatting positon!! Funny that for some reason I loose my will of hip driving my way up. (Especially if I use 2.5lbs plates under my heels. Yes I can go lower but I can not go up at times and have to rest the bar to the pins)


1 why are you pushing yourself to squat 55 (whatever unit you use) when you know you can squat 35? Thats like 20 units in difference.

2 it will only take you a few sessions of consistent training and a push to achieve you barbell squat goal :) I am now happily in the big boys room working on squats. I am terrified of that exercise due to its balancing aspect.

3 have you approached someone who is knowledgable enougb to critique your form?

 |-| 
|-| cob2dlp || 3 || Probably at least half of /r/fitness has done the same thing. It's super embarrassing, but totally normal. That's why those safety pins exist! 

Pay careful attention to form and mobility, and keep practicing! |-| 
|-| coaxmec || 3 || Eat more calories from protein. If your form is ok and you legit can't even lift the bar, start with dumbbell squats, like the goblet squat. Get as low as you can, move up weight every week, you'll be lifting that bar in no time. A year in and you'll be slapping big girl plates on it (45lbs) for sure. Just keep feeding your muscles and stay consistent, working out at least 3 times a week. |-| 
|-| cobkbyx || -3 || Why do you want to switch from doing barbell squats if you've been comfortable doing them? Squats are a dangerous exercise and you shouldn't force yourself to do them if you aren't an athlete who needs to them for whatever strength gain you believe it gives you. You're a small girl, if want a nice ass do weighted lunges and stairmaster instead. Plenty of alternatives with infinitely less risk. |-| 
|-| cob66ua || 36 || Out of everything I've seen, Angus MacAskill is probably the most compelling in terms of legendary feats of strength.  He was 7' 9" and holds the record for being the world's largest non-pathological giant.  His body was actually completely proportionate (in other words, he looked like a guy who was 5'9" but he was 7'9").  He also weighed in at between 450-500lbs but he wasn't fat.  As you can imagine, he had superhuman strength... some of which might have been exaggerated but much of it was very well documented.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_MacAskill#Adult_career |-| 
|-| cob46n9 || 145 || Can confirm. |-| 
|-| cob2xcg || 47 || At his peak Louis was 5 feet 10 inches (178 cm) in height and weighed 310 pounds (140 kg), with a 21-inch (53 cm) neck, a 54-inch (140 cm) chest, a 45-inch (110 cm) waist, 22-inch (56 cm) biceps, 19-inch (48 cm) forearms, 11-inch (28 cm) wrists, 33-inch (84 cm) thighs, 23-inch (58 cm) calves.


Definitely a big boy. I want to believe these lifts but they just seem incomprehensible. He supported a platform weighing over 4,300lbs. Is there any modern day attempt at anything close to this?  |-| 
|-| cobgqh5 || 11 || &gt;Louis took care of a dozen opponents single-handedly by picking up his adversaries and using them as human missiles and battering rams.

He beat a motherfucker with another motherfucker. |-| 
|-| cob61mq || 16 || This is my great great great uncle or something... In any case a few "family stories" about him was that he owned a bar and he used to introduce his wife to others by having her climb on the palm of his hand and standing on it while he would make the introductions.    

Anyways... always fun when his name comes up knowing some of his blood runs through my veins. 

(TIL veins is an exception to "i before e except after c" rule)

 |-| 
|-| cobg1nv || 6 || His Mum was a fucking bouncer. That's pretty hardcore. |-| 
|-| cob7xny || 13 || The 4,000 pounds lift listed there is a backlift.  Distinctly different from most of the modern lifts people are doing.  Here's an example of Paul Anderson with a 6,000+ pound backlift:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Anderson_%28weightlifter%29

&gt; Guinness Book of World Records did cite him in its 1985 edition for a backlift of 6,000+ pounds. This became the basis for his reputation as the "World's Strongest Man".

Or Gregg Ernst with a 5,000+ backlift:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Ernst

&gt; Gregg once backlifted over two tons (app. 5,340 lbs.) of two cars on a platform...

As far as I can tell, backlift records are all "make shit up and see what sticks."  Not that I doubt any of these people are ridiculously strong, but I still respect Hafthor's achievements just as much as I did before reading about all this backlift nonsense. |-| 
|-| cob61h1 || 9 || http://chaosandpain.blogspot.com/2011/08/cant-gain-weight-guess-what-youre-doing.html?zx=3eb4b7e98f880edb |-| 
|-| cobdi10 || 4 || [And here is a video of Derek Poundstone lifting the "Louis Cyr Stone" that was modeled after a stone that Cyr supposedly had lifted over his shoulder.](http://youtu.be/QXKQsTa6ByI) He was the only competitor to lift the stone. The whole event was in Cyr's honor. |-| 
|-| coblgkq || 4 || speaking of louis cyr, here is the trailer for the movie

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXpkspT7CYE |-| 
|-| cobea92 || 5 || Le film sur sa vie est très intéressant avec beaucoup de détails techniques sur ses prouesses! Il est récent, je vous suggère fortement de le visionner! |-| 
|-| cobg7jx || 5 || "There were people equal to Hafthor and the contestants in the WSM contest throughout history. There just weren't many of them, and they would have looked like Cyr."

The thing is, in the era where we have really good reliable data, this just isn't true. If you took today's performances back 40 years, people wouldn't have believed them possible.

For example, in 1980, people would talk about Bill Kazmaier as one of the strongest men of all time.  He was world record holder in the Log Press at 157kg.

But look at the log press in last years Arnold Classic:  every competitor there lifted 170kg *for reps*, and 5 men pressed 200kg.  The world record now stands at 227kg.

Of course, there may have been "one in a century" level outliers who would be comparable to today's lifters, but to say they've been around throughout history seems a bit of a stretch to me.
 |-| 
|-| cob6v24 || 7 || pretty sure all these cases of old timey people lifting insane amounts of weight are complete bullshit. Cyr was probably strong as hell, but there's absolutely no way a 5'10 man without the use of any steroids or proper nutrition + weight lifting could lift anything close to Hafthor or any modern strongman. To think that anybody could naturally compete with him or any other world class modern strongman is crazy - maybe the 7'9 guy might've been close, but out of everyone here that's the only person I'd believe could MAYBE compete with modern strongmen. |-| 
|-| cobq9dz || 3 || A lot of these old timey lifts are exaggerated/faked. Look at Paul Anderson. He claimed to squat 1200 but never did it in any competition. However he did compete in the Olympics in weightlifting and his numbers there while good are far less impressive. They are much lower than modern lifters. It seems as a general rule the greater the standardization and verification the less impressive historic feats are. I think it's pretty clear what's going on. |-| 
|-| cob5fzz || -5 || My guess is that his brain lacked the ability to block muscle input thus allowing him to utilize his muscles more completely. A normal person cannot utilize all of their muscle fibers and it can damage bones and joints.  |-| 
|-| cob1fpm || 22 || Have you tried hip thrusts? http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/barbell-hip-thrust
 |-| 
|-| coax629 || 99 || Potentially you may be shedding a bit of fat and gaining muscle mass. As the muscle doesn't accumulate as fast as you can shed weight it could lead smaller butt and breasts in the short term. This would be further exacerbated by skipping heavy lower body compound lifts like the squat. |-| 
|-| cob08k0 || 83 || PLEASE don't put the health of your brain at risk to cave to the "squats solve everything" hivemind. Your brain is much more important than your butt. |-| 
|-| cob7z5d || 6 || This may sound silly, but have you considered yoga?  It's  not as easy as people think.  Plus,  I think the slow movements with good breathing would not aggravate your brain cyst.  Yoga can help prevent injury in some cases.  If you combine it with your regular routine you may see some better results.  |-| 
|-| cob5gch || 5 || Yup. Overtraining in a real thing.  |-| 
|-| cob1xd7 || 4 || I don't know about a brain cyst, so I won't pretend I do. I would just like to point out that bulgarian split squats seem to hit my glutes more than normal squats. |-| 
|-| cob8svr || 4 || If your butt feels softer than your diet may be the problem. I would try eating at maintenance without changing your current workout plan.

Sounds like you need to re comp instead of gain. It's still is possible to gain muscle on a maintenance depending on your current body-fat %.  |-| 
|-| cobbe5k || 4 || You mentioned bulking: is your ass getting bigger? Or flatter? The difference being it could be getting bigger, but no proportionately, so it looks flatter. 

If you're bulking, don't bother with the look you have. The point of bulking is to just get bigger, then to lose all the fat to expose the muscle. You won't be able to get a good idea of your ass until you cut. 

You are feeling softer, probably because you're gaining fat on it. Gauge if you are able to lift more weight.

Also, try squatting again, and improve your poster, form, and breathing. 

For a great ass, you need to target 3 types of motion. The up-down movement (squats), left-right movement (side lunges/side step glue squat), and the front-back movement (lunges/walking lunges). A lot of people just squat heavy, and it gives them results. But if you want a bubble butt, you should incorporate the rest of the movements, especially something for the left-right movement.  |-| 
|-| cob6p79 || 7 || Work on that diet like you did on your workouts and you will get somewhere. |-| 
|-| coavjtq || 18 || Just want to give an honourable mention to /r/xxfitness, they may be able to help.

My instinct those is that since you're trying to bulk up a bit right now, and many women tend to accumulate fat in their lower body first, that may be causing the issue.  Just a guess though, I'm not an expert.

I am curious as to why squats were giving you a headache though.  Were these weighted squats or bodyweight?  |-| 
|-| cob2gkc || 3 || There are some good answers here. Another possibility might be form. Your glutes are hard to activate at the best of times, so it doesn't take much for them to slack off and let other muscles take the strain. 

Next time you do glute exercises, focus your attention on exactly which muscles are activating. It may not be the problem at all, but worth checking! 

Also, glutes respond best to deeper and faster movements. Adding weight for hypertrophy is good, but you also need to get all the fibres engaged. Deep squat jumps give the right sort of motion to help develop glutes, so you might want to incorporate some moves that mimic this type of movement but without causing you headaches. |-| 
|-| cobhput || 4 || I didn't see it mentioned here and it's near impossible to tell without seeing a picture, but you might have some posterior pelvic tilt issues, which makes it appear as though you have no butt.  Here's a pretty good write-up about it with some potential solutions:  http://www.reddit.com/comments/f08rd/writeup_about_the_posterior_pelvic_tilt_or_the_no/ |-| 
|-| cob27ip || 3 || A deep lunge/squat should activate those glutes plenty. You could also do a reverse lunge off a step/incline to get a greater stretch/ROM for the glutes as well. You could also play around with single leg RDLs with DBs. |-| 
|-| cob7fn2 || 3 || From personal experience (my main concern is and has always been my butt) I think you'd do better with fewer workouts. 3 times a week for me has always resulted in my butt getting smaller. My ideal is switching between 1 and 2 times. Focus on muscle gaining exercises, not toning ones, try adding in dead lifts for instance or maybe try the hack machine if regular squats give you headaches. I'd suggest 2 sets with 12 reps for each exercise and maybe 5 or 6 exercises each time. Don't overdo it with repetition as it is meant to tone and will give you a flatter butt. |-| 
|-| cob9qu0 || 3 || There's a few things that can cause you to have headaches while squatting. 

1. Non-strategic breathing

I also suggest trying high and wide stance on the leg press for your glutes if you don't do squats. |-|

|-| cobs5pg || 12 || Everyone in this thread is going on about how it keeps their sanity.

Yes, absolutely. I don't think anyone's trying to take them away. They're super, super important mentally, if nothing else.

But fact is, I *do* hear it repeated a lot that cheat days are "good" for you health-wise, and it's nice to see some science behind why that's not true. |-| 
|-| cobl7wu || 4 || &gt; quoted text "Well, no research has ever said that it's ever fine to 'binge eat' or to consume bad fats and simple carbohydrates in large amounts."

I'm not sure that's really true. Certainly there is research showing that lean individuals can overeat (significantly) for a couple of days and have no increase in fat mass (water weight on the other hand...). Essentially because of NEAT, which is actually pretty neat.

That's not to say the cheat days are healthy, but they don't necessarily cause you to gain even a tiny amount of fat. 

Edit: to save time, the study below overfed a bunch of lean individuals by 1500 kcal per day for 3 days. No exercise permitted. Subjects showed an increase in water weight but zero increase in fat gain.

|-| cobj0vr || 13 || i think you went click bait style with your title. you state nutritional, but your post is all about weight loss. everyone here knows weight loss is calories in vs calories out so a cheat day has no benefit and makes it harder. but from a nutritional standpoint, you have clarified nothing. |-| 
|-| cobwp8b || 3 || When I'm on a cut, 500 calories feels like a goddamned feast. I've never really felt the need to eat a large surplus on cheat days. It just means like a normal person for a day.

My personal rule is that I never let my diet get in the way of a special occasion. |-| 
|-| cobj8pm || -5 || That's some interesting information there OP. Thanks for sharing. 

I don't do cheat days. The people who do cheat days have to do them to keep their sanity, but why? My theory (which is more than likely right) is that they still hold a psychological attachment to food and therefore need to have cheat days to satiate that need. I've gotten to the point where I am simply not attracted to unhealthy foods or eating way above my caloric goal for the day. I would MUCH rather eat healthy than have a cheat day. 

That isn't to say that it's the end of the world if you have a cheat day once in a while, but if you make it a regular, planned thing, I think you need to take a hard look at what you really value. It has no health benefits, and the only reason people do it is for their psychological needs, not nutritional (well, sometimes nutritional deficiencies can cause cravings for certain things but that's another discussion).  |-|

A back off set of deadlifts with fat grips (or just a towel around the bar) is a pretty good way to do it if you are mostly concerned about your grip in deadlifts.

It looks like you lose tightness when you hit proper depth. This is also a pretty shitty angle as I can't see what's going on with your feet. It's also hard to notice, but you have a buttwink going on. And why are you shifting around between reps? Once you're in place, stay in place.

Get a better angle and some better light and I might be able to help you a bit more. |-| 
|-| cob5ipp || 6 || I had lower back pain from squats as well. I had some butt wink going on and you do too.

If you're experiencing pain that's different from soreness or tightness, definitely roll your lower back out, continue strengthening it, and most importantly get your chest up higher during your lifts.  |-|

If he's more interested in a split than SS then let him do it. Or if he wants to do PPL, then go for that. A lot of /r/fitness is going to say SS or 5x5 or something because he's a beginner, but that's not everyone's cup of tea. |-|

|-| cob248p || 29 || I'm getting the impression that you're using 'VO2max' to mean something it doesn't.  

&gt;if I try to do minute on/minute off on the treadmill or rower I feel like I'm dying, hard sprints make my lungs hurt, and interval training makes me feel like I'm going to cough up a lung.

If you're doing them right, this will always be the case.  Like, at no point ever does 100% effort feel easy.   For anyone.  

Working across intensity zones will be the best way to improve your conditioning.  Something like 80% LISS and 20% HIIT seems to be ideal for more endurance minded folks.   And you can carve out some threshold runs out of the 80 for some middle ground stuff, but it should be a small wedge.  

 |-| 
|-| cob4dvf || 7 || You need to do endurance work to build VO2max. Sprinting won't necessarily help.  |-| 
|-| cob24lm || 4 || Similar situation to yours. I smoked for ten years and I'm two years smoke free. I like to mix short 1-3 mile runs with tabatta intervals. I also started kick boxing which has helped a lot. Also I notice of my diet sucks my endurance will as well.  |-| 
|-| cob261a || 4 || This is a good question and one that has a lot of different opinions about.  In my opinion, a variety of intensities and durations work best.

I got to a point where the Concept2 VO2max calculator estimated my VO2max in the mid-40's.  I ran hard all summer, rowed hard all year, and the figure ever so slowly creeped up as my 2K time went down.

I went on a cut and lost 20 lbs in anticipation of my wedding.  My VO2max quickly popped over 50.  If you feel you've plateaued on a performance standpoint, then since the unit is mL/(kg·min), lowering your weight and maintaining your performance will increase your VO2max linearly. |-|

I get a shit load of bacon grease from the restaurant I work at so if you can find a restaurant willing to part with their bacon grease you'll be set. Otherwise you might want some butter too (that shit is expensive). |-| 
|-| cob72rp || 3 || Holy Shit, I would cut back to working out 4, maybe 5 days. Your body needs enough rest to grow. I also wouldn't limit your intake of carbs, there's really no need to. The amount of fat you gain is going to depend on whether your body is ready to use your calories for something or not. If you're working out consistently, which you are, your body will make use of those calories. You may also not be eating enough at this point. You have to adjust your caloric intake if you keep building mass.

Protein shakes seems like your best option for now. Potatoes and rice are also excellent. I would also stop doing any and all cardio, it doesn't stimulate muscle growth and its just more calories you will be expending. If you keep your rests short between lifts you should get enough of a cardiovascular workout. |-|

Welcome to fittit

As far as tiger push ups go I've never heard of them, but if skullcrushers hurt in a bad way don't do them. If tiger pushups work your triceps well and don't hurt, do them

Edit: totally know those I've never heard them called that. They're probably good, I'd also recommend diamond pushups or behind the back bench dips for bodyweight triceps |-| 
|-| cob2bgc || 5 || Scott Hermann fitness posted a variation to the skull crusher on his youtube channel that is actually overhead triceps extension, it takes a ton of pressure off the elbows... Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_KZxkY_0cM |-| 
|-| cobnexb || 14 || Yup. I lift heavy shit and eat literally whatever. Just try to hit protein by any means possible |-| 
|-| cobqkjx || 11 || I don't necessarily think he "eats whatever the hell he wants," but it does come off that he's not obsessively tracking calories or macros, just eating "quality" foods (this is so ambiguous).


I am usually pretty similar unless I'm cutting for a meet. I loosely track calories for a couple days every so often to make sure I'm eating around what I want, but I don't weigh and measure everything, nor do I track macros. I usually just track protein. I try to prepare most of my own food rather than eating out and I eat mostly whole foods. This is what works for me. Tracking too much makes me crazy obsessive. I definitely notice a difference when I am not eating high enough food QUALITY or I am not eating enough protein, but I don't care if I eat 70g of fat one day when I'm only "supposed" to eat 65g, for example.


Also, if you have Twitter, Lucas Parker is hilarious on there. |-| 
|-| cobnf0z || 17 || Honestly I did for awhile. I thought cause I was working so hard it might not matter. I had results but they were slow. My workouts weren't executed well, I was still not feeling great. 

I've really focused on nutrition the past few months and my results are much quicker. I actually feel really good all day long. I have tons of energy, really positive and overall healthy feeling. The nutrition is definitely the harder part, but man it's worth it. |-| 
|-| cobt1m8 || 6 || Yes I eat whatever I want, usually at dinner time. Breakfast and lunch is more structured. But I have no dietary rules and have seen good results because I lift and get high intensity cardio often. 

If I wanted to get shredded 6/8 pack abs I would calorie count and the eat at deficit for a couple weeks. Then at maintenance to maintain  |-| 
|-| cobq42s || 4 || I do. I understand dirty eating isn't near as effective, but I don't want to invest time, energy, cost to eat right.

I mean, I don't eat candy and everything. I eat health consciously. When I grocery shop I buy what I think will help me; chicken, peanuts, milk, yogurt, rice, etc.. 

I just check the weight scale every day and go by that on how much to eat, that's my calorie counting. You just have to think smart when you eat. I drink 100 grams of protein everyday and get in the rest in food. 

I'm satisfied with my results. I just want to look good naked and be confident with my shirt off in public. If I wanted to be bigger I'd eat by the rules. |-| 
|-| cobr6kp || 4 || I am female, 6'1, 180+/-5, and less than 18% body fat. I eat absolutely whatever I want. Probably 1 regular meal a day (steak + veg + startch) and the rest of the time I eat small meals and snacks round the clock. On average I do 3+ hours of training 13/14 days with one half day a week and one off day every 2 weeks. I am a rower so about 2/3rds of my training is endurance work (rowing, erging, biking, running), 1/6th sport specific interval training and 1/6th strength training (periodized - so I lift heavy at certain times of the year and at other times work on strength endurance). All told I probably consume 4-5k calories a day and haven't put on fat in a year (I get bod pod tested fairly often). I find eating often helps me keep my blood sugar up and carbohydrates are totally essential to keep me performing at my best day in and day out (in rowing we train like marathon runners and race like sprinters). My nutritionist basically told me to not record calories because I am hyper conservative with my recording and competitive even with myself so I will do stupid shit like "save" 1500 calories for the end of the day and then work out for 90 mins until I am at a 3000kcal defecit that I can't possibly make up after 7pm when I am done training. Anyways.... Now I eat all the food and I am happier, fitter, and honestly more cut than I ever was when I recorded my daily intake and output. |-| 
|-| cobnrib || 3 || I'm a novice when it comes to weightlifting, but I've always been a "live to eat" person. So yeah, I diligently go to the gym and I've been losing weight, but I still eat good food more than healthy food because I love good food.  |-| 
|-| cob9uss || 11 || Separately, so that you'll know what quantity of creatine you are getting.  A lot of powders have an unspecified amount of creatine in a proprietary blend.  You want 5g of creatine mono a day. |-| 
|-| cobbnwj || 3 || I do them separately so that I can get it cheaper, I can control the brand of each, and I can control the ratio. 

When I go to the gym I pre-mix 5g of creatine with 2 scoops of Protein, and then fill it up with water and kill it as I leave the gym.  |-| 
|-| cobj8qb || -3 || I buy a tub of protein powder and dump in a bottle of flavourless creatine.  I'll drink one scoop before my workout, then one scoop after.  I think it roughly works out to the recommended daily requirement, or whatever.  I do this because I don't really care.  People are always saying "5 grams 45mins30secs before your workout...grape juice only...spike insulin levels...better absorbing, maximum efficiency..." and shit like that.  And yeah, maybe it does work a bit better, but crap like that takes all the fun out of it for me.  I just figure:  one mix in one bottle...get it in ya...get to the gym and lift weights.  And keep at it. |-| 
|-| cob2gq7 || 7 || Your hips are shooting up too fast. The lifts are divided into two distinct parts: your hips shooting up, then your glutes pushing forward. You can tell your lower back has to do more work than it needs to in the second half of the lift. Try to streamline the movement so that you're utilizing hip drive throughout the movement. |-| 
|-| cob11ti || 5 || Don't strain your head up like that.  Keep your chin tucked and have a straight line from the back of your head down to your spine |-| 
|-| cob0xkr || -15 || Looks good but just don't drop the weights.... Negatives are just as important if not more than the burst up.  Ease them to almost touch and bring back up |-| 
|-| coayl18 || 3 || If you get the app it'll tell you how to proceed. If you fail a lift 3 days in a row, you deload by 10% and continue on. |-| 
|-| coayrhd || 3 || Don't let it get you down. Failure is part of the program!

On some days if the squat racks are tied up, I'll do bench or press first while waiting.

My squats don't seem to suffer and it may be a good thing to switch up every once in a while... |-| 
|-| coaziw6 || 3 || If you're hitting your 5x5 squats every time while keeping to the 3 minute rest I'd say just stick to the program as prescribed for now.  However, when you start missing reps on the squat you could consider deloading quicker than SL recommends (after just 1 or 2 failed days, rather than 3).

That's what I prefer to do, since like you say, you hit squats everyday anyway and it may be hindering your other lifts.  When you get to a day where you miss a few reps on the squat, it may be beneficial to immediately deload the next workout rather than grind through another day (or two) at that same weight.  It'll give you a few workouts to really focus on your other lifts before you start getting back up to that tough squat weight.

Stick to the program on the other lifts, but don't be afraid to drop the squats 10% a little sooner when you start really grinding them out.  For me, it has really benefited my other lifts as I feel great on the other movements when I deload squats.  It's definitely helped me push through some potential plateaus on the bench/row/ohp saving that little bit extra in the tank not having to grind out heavy squats for a week or two. |-| 
|-| cob5w0l || 3 || I'm liking doing a heavy, medium, and light day for squats. Medium is 5x5, heavy is 3x2, light is 4x8. That heavy day really helps the 5x5 weight feel lighter, mentally.

But the first thing to try is deloading. You can drop to 3x5. Switch the order so squats isn't always first. Swap out like Wed for lighter squats, maybe front squats. Lots of different ways to go really. You may want to experiment a bit to see what you personally prefer. |-| 
|-| cobbh01 || 3 || Do your upper body before your lower body. Personally I save squats and deadlifts for my last 'main' lift, but still do them before accessory work. |-|
