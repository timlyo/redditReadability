It's been months and my iPad version hasn't been working at all in the fullest / best way. And to be honest, I would like the bugs fixed but I think a completely new overhaul (app basically) would benefit the userbase more than just applying a long overdue update to the app.

If you check /r/alienblue you usually see tons of problems people experience everyday. I just wanted an update to this - officially by reddit as it feels like its' just reddit's name slapped onto a title as Official.

Even if it's not selling collated data directly, you're selling a big bag of information to the advertisers at a premium price who then collate it and use it to target market to individual users, right?

So can you clarify what this means? Admins can see everything that a user does including reading their private messages and anything else they do with their account. How is access to this limited in any way?

With this said, I'm also a bit uncomfortable with what happens when reddit fires employees or when employees leave reddit. There was an issue last year with an administrator who acted at times as a community manager who had the power to ban the accounts of any user that he wanted. He was either fired or resigned from reddit last year yet he had total clearance to any user's account on this site and during his tenure as an admin he was abrasive with a number of users and openly alluded to things that some users had said in their private messages and made these allusions in public comments on this site. That didn't sit well with me at all and I found it to be a clear violation of your site's rules and it was a clear violation ethically if not legally of conduct. He no longer is employed by reddit yet he could have very well taken down all sorts of private information exchanged in private messages from users that he did not like and then walked away with it once he left reddit as an employee. This type of scenario really does not sit well with me at all.  |-|

Why? Why is there no timeout on that? 90 days seems long enough, especially since you could do a separate stipulation for spammers and those banned if you wish to keep the IP for preventing re-use for the same purposes.

Or is that suppose to be excluded after you delete an account? And if so why not reword that? You could add 'until 90 days after deleting that account'. As it is it means you can allow yourself to keep the IP's

|-| cnqcgpr || 3 || Since we are on the subject on mobile apps, I have a few questions related to the reddit IAmA app. 

1) the reddit IAmA app could use some updates to help functionality by triggering threads with a tap. Or does this feature already exist and I just haven't found it?

In losing the threaded appearance of what makes reddit reddit, the functionality of the app is greatly diminished. 

For example, when there are two IAmA
Hosts in the same thread (e.g. two guys in a band) the app won't recognize the other one as OP. If the other OP replies to a question first, it will show his answer as the "question"... So only both answers are shown. 

Also sometimes when the questions are already answered by another user, and the OP chimes in to say "yes, that's exactly it" as a response to the user response, I don't actually get to see the original question and have to guess at it. Terribly annoying. 

2) is there a subreddit for the official IAmA app where I could post these and further concerns like /r/alienblue is for alienblue? 

In alien blue, the subreddit (feedback channel) is clearly visible on the sidebar. I am not sure of the origins of the devs for the IAmA app, but it sure would be nice to have it be consistent throughout the apps. 

3) paid version to get rid of apps for IAmA?

As with alien blue now, I assume this update means that we will be seeing ads on the mobile IAmA app in weeks to come. Or am I wrong about that?
Is there going to be a one-time IAP to get rid of said ads then? 

Tl;dr consistency and functionality of reddit IAmA app 

Lastly, thank you for your efforts to remain transparent with your users.

If you responded with data - If it was anything from an organised /r/letsSuicideBombTheAmericanArmy to /r/tipsForDruggingPreschoolersAsAnOutsider or the likes (Fake subreddits - Just examples), you're walking a VERY fine line, and restricting satirical subreddits and comments based off what you deem as "fine" ( /r/bdsm ? /r/watchpeopledie ? /r/necrophilia ? Who deems what's right or not? Something as simple as /r/beastiality is likely illegal where the server is hosted)  
  
I'm pretty sure there are PLENTY of subreddits I know about that are blatantly illegal in the US, and piles more that are private. They are there for those who share a common interest in things that might be illegal in one location and not another, or are simply considered too taboo to express in modern society.

I'm a great admirer of yours, but was surprised to see that you -- or *anyone* with your stellar credentials and privacy-conscious mindset, really -- would be selected by DHS to develop policy for TSA.

Just stunned that an organization which does so much so wrong has had the benefit of such fantastic expertise, then continued to develop policy that seems antithetical/antagonistic to whatever you, a Berkman/EFF alum, would presumably have advised them. |-|

With this said, I'm also a bit uncomfortable with what happens when reddit fires employees or when employees leave reddit. There was an issue last year with an administrator who acted at times as a community manager who had the power to ban the accounts of any user that he wanted. He was either fired or resigned from reddit last year yet he had total clearance to any user's account on this site and during his tenure as an admin he was abrasive with a number of users and openly alluded to things that some users had said in their private messages and made these allusions in public comments on this site. That didn't sit well with me at all and I found it to be a clear violation of your site's rules and it was a clear violation ethically if not legally of conduct. He no longer is employed by reddit yet he could have very well taken down all sorts of private information exchanged in private messages from users that he did not like and then walked away with it once he left reddit as an employee. This type of scenario really does not sit well with me at all.  |-|

If you responded with data - If it was anything from an organised /r/letsSuicideBombTheAmericanArmy to /r/tipsForDruggingPreschoolersAsAnOutsider or the likes (Fake subreddits - Just examples), you're walking a VERY fine line, and restricting satirical subreddits and comments based off what you deem as "fine" ( /r/bdsm ? /r/watchpeopledie ? /r/necrophilia ? Who deems what's right or not? Something as simple as /r/beastiality is likely illegal where the server is hosted)  
  
I'm pretty sure there are PLENTY of subreddits I know about that are blatantly illegal in the US, and piles more that are private. They are there for those who share a common interest in things that might be illegal in one location and not another, or are simply considered too taboo to express in modern society.

|-| cnqcgpr || 3 || Since we are on the subject on mobile apps, I have a few questions related to the reddit IAmA app. 

1) the reddit IAmA app could use some updates to help functionality by triggering threads with a tap. Or does this feature already exist and I just haven't found it?

In losing the threaded appearance of what makes reddit reddit, the functionality of the app is greatly diminished. 

For example, when there are two IAmA
Hosts in the same thread (e.g. two guys in a band) the app won't recognize the other one as OP. If the other OP replies to a question first, it will show his answer as the "question"... So only both answers are shown. 

Also sometimes when the questions are already answered by another user, and the OP chimes in to say "yes, that's exactly it" as a response to the user response, I don't actually get to see the original question and have to guess at it. Terribly annoying. 

2) is there a subreddit for the official IAmA app where I could post these and further concerns like /r/alienblue is for alienblue? 

In alien blue, the subreddit (feedback channel) is clearly visible on the sidebar. I am not sure of the origins of the devs for the IAmA app, but it sure would be nice to have it be consistent throughout the apps. 

3) paid version to get rid of apps for IAmA?

As with alien blue now, I assume this update means that we will be seeing ads on the mobile IAmA app in weeks to come. Or am I wrong about that?
Is there going to be a one-time IAP to get rid of said ads then? 

Tl;dr consistency and functionality of reddit IAmA app

If you check /r/alienblue you usually see tons of problems people experience everyday. I just wanted an update to this - officially by reddit as it feels like its' just reddit's name slapped onto a title as Official.

What feature am I missing that sharing my information would facilitate? 

I've used most of the android apps I don't find any of the user interface changes worth the my screen space reducing due to advertising. 

I understand reddit has to have income to keep the site around. I'm just less willing to have adds on mobile. When we see an official reddit app for Android if there are ads I wouldn't know what would draw me towards it.

So can you clarify what this means? Admins can see everything that a user does including reading their private messages and anything else they do with their account. How is access to this limited in any way?

With this said, I'm also a bit uncomfortable with what happens when reddit fires employees or when employees leave reddit. There was an issue last year with an administrator who acted at times as a community manager who had the power to ban the accounts of any user that he wanted. He was either fired or resigned from reddit last year yet he had total clearance to any user's account on this site and during his tenure as an admin he was abrasive with a number of users and openly alluded to things that some users had said in their private messages and made these allusions in public comments on this site. That didn't sit well with me at all and I found it to be a clear violation of your site's rules and it was a clear violation ethically if not legally of conduct. He no longer is employed by reddit yet he could have very well taken down all sorts of private information exchanged in private messages from users that he did not like and then walked away with it once he left reddit as an employee. This type of scenario really does not sit well with me at all.  |-| 
|-| cnqj380 || 38 || How about an update and clarity around the use of  the "shadow ban" 

We have seen it being massively abused by some of the reddit admins especially during the early days of "Gamergate" 

It shouldn't be allowed that people are quietly banned without being notified. I had an account banned and wasn't aware until notified by a mod. 

I understand that something like the shadowban needs to exist to combat spammers but it is clearly being abused at present.

If the TSA is getting such high-quality advice...are they just ignoring it?  This is like discovering that Tim Wu is an adviser to Comcast.  Don't get me wrong -- I'm not criticizing you.  Just stunned that an organization which does so much so wrong has had the benefit of such fantastic expertise, then continued to develop policy that seems antithetical/antagonistic to whatever you, a Berkman/EFF alum, would presumably have advised them. |-| 
|-| cnqk8we || 3 || Kinda off-topic, but do you plan on telling the community what reddit is going to do with the money it got from the recent funding? |-| 
|-| cnqm073 || 3 || Have you read and agreed to the terms and conditions? |-| 
|-| cnqm8k2 || 3 || So many people on here are so paranoid.   |-| 
|-| cnqpoxm || 3 || Not sure I'm keen on "other exigent circumstances." mainly because it's so broad. I'd rather see something outlining that a warrant or other legal process is required, something more than just a request and or a phone call,  before data will be handed over. "external requests" can mean anything as well, I'd assume the alphabet agencies but it could also include parties like the MPAA. 

Not that this isn't a common clause, but I'd like to see more sites being a little less broad and giving with user data.  |-| 
|-| cnqpppx || 3 || &gt;We reserve the right to delay notice to users of external requests for information in cases involving the exploitation of minors and other exigent circumstances.

Gross.  So if cops spin the right tail, you won't notify a user that they are demanding info?

 |-| 
|-| cnqvx6j || 3 || Could there be a "ban user" option? |-| 
|-| co4s5zd || 3 || A question that I read a lot before joining Reddit.

Why don't people get notified if their profile banned for any reason, and why don't the Mods mention the reason? I understand Reddit has a very strict policy and that is good though, but on the other hand i think it would be good to tell them about the ban and reason too..?  |-| 
|-| cnqg12m || 17 || Could you clarify the double-standard you hold /r/KotakuInAction up to?  |-| 
|-| cnq9h5a || 8 || what's the deal with supporting the boycotting of companies in the name of fighting SOPA/PIPA, yet taking down submissions of people doing the same for companies running ads on clickbait/corrupt/anti-gg websites? |-| 
|-| cnqeeqx || 8 || It's nice that you're thinking about our privacy.

It'd be great if you could consider the privacy of dead people, and their families, /r/cutefemalecorpses/ (NSFL) breaches privacy in a BIG way.

Most humane people would consider a dead person's naked body as 'sensitive personal information', quoting your privacy policy.

They deserve privacy too. |-| 
|-| cnqh1xs || 9 || BRING BACK VOTE COUNTERS. Transparency &gt; marketing capabilities of the platform. |-| 
|-| cnq8hms || 8 || &gt; Ask Us Anything

Any chance of official public moderation log support from reddit? |-| 
|-| cnq9hgn || 7 || Any insight on why mobile users are so quick to give up their information over browser users? |-| 
|-| cnqa9mb || 4 || Wait... you're the CEO? |-| 
|-| cnqaopf || 7 || &gt; One of the first challenges for this group was how we manage and use data via our official mobile apps, since mobile platforms and advertising work differently than on the web.

No, they don't. They both involve pushing obnoxious ads at users while simultaneously siphoning as much information as possible about the user.  The only difference is that the Web user has a far easier time keeping themselves from becoming victim to such scummy practices.

&gt; We believe most of our mobile users are more willing to share information to have better experiences. 

Of course, if you gave them any choice in the matter, most of them would say "no". |-| 
|-| cnqb9g2 || 5 || The Internet is an extremely scary place, particularly if that someone  has problems dealing with paranoia. Clearly state what you will do to protect your customers and DO NOT go back on the policies in place unless the situation requires human intervention.  |-| 
|-| cnq8jre || 8 || Will you guys still be as clear always? props for the good work |-| 
|-| cnq91p8 || 4 || I know this isn't relating to the polices - but when is the "official" reddit app bugs going to be updated and fixed? It's been months and my iPad version hasn't been working at all in the fullest / best way. And to be honest, I would like the bugs fixed but I think a completely new overhaul (app basically) would benefit the userbase more than just applying a long overdue update to the app.

If you check /r/alienblue you usually see tons of problems people experience everyday. I just wanted an update to this - officially by reddit as it feels like its' just reddit's name slapped onto a title as Official.

(unrelated, but will reddit ever move to CSS 3? I would love adjustable headers by window size) |-| 
|-| cnqbz7q || 4 || "**Except for the IP address you use to create the account**, all IP addresses will be deleted from our servers after 90 days"

Why? Why is there no timeout on that? 90 days seems long enough, especially since you could do a separate stipulation for spammers and those banned if you wish to keep the IP for preventing re-use for the same purposes.

Or is that suppose to be excluded after you delete an account? And if so why not reword that? You could add 'until 90 days after deleting that account'. As it is it means you can allow yourself to keep the IP's

|-| cnqb4ur || 4 || Why are some name and shame sub's allowed to exist while others get shut down or have shadow bands handed out for minor infractions, when some of the bigger ones have encouraged doxxing in the past? This is what I really don't get. |-| 
|-| cnqlfow || 5 || Stop censoring things. That is all. |-| 
|-| cnq96z7 || 3 || &gt; Transparency about our privacy practices and policy is an important part of our values. In the next two weeks, we also plan to publish a transparency report to let you know when we disclosed or removed user information in response to external requests in 2014. This report covers government information requests for user information and copyright removal requests, and it summarizes how we responded.

&gt; We plan to publish a transparency report annually and to update our Privacy Policy 

WOW! This is seriously as good as it gets. This sets a great example of a follow through after making the numerous claims of being transparent.   |-| 
|-| cnq9m46 || 3 || Do you plan on implementing some form of setting that allows users to hide their profiles or specific posts from their profiles? |-| 
|-| cnqaeqv || 3 || The other option is you could just make it physically impossible to know a user's information. So even if a lawyer, court, 3rd world dictator- or anyone, anywhere- demanded you give them user information, you could reasonably say, "We cannot. Our system is physically impossible to know the user's information." If you wanted to advertise you could separate user identity from user behavior and only sell user's behavior or subreddit behavior to advertisers. |-| 
|-| cnqguwa || 4 || Slightly tangential question: 

I've recently reported several users who were blatantly posting what reddit calls "Personal Information" online, and was ignored. 

Was the "no Personal Information" rule quietly discarded in the past few months or something? Were these users given a pass on doxxing people? Just curious, found it strange and inconsistent. Thanks! |-| 
|-| cnqjanx || 4 || Please stop mods from banning people because they dont understand figures of speech or slang. There are these super mods that are out of control. They are mods on many different subs.  

Another good idea could be to limit how many subs you can mod.   |-| 
|-| cnq9cqs || 4 || Why should we trust this when you already selectively apply your own policies so much already? |-| 
|-| cnq92md || 3 || Why does this site suck so much compared to eight years ago? What are you going about vote manipulation via sites like these: http://www.buyredditvotes.us/buy-reddit-votes
