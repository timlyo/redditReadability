|-| cnu0d6v || 789 || CarThrottle.com: 

"The combination of 200mph+ speeds and a change in the road surface caused the supercar - which was on Czech plates - to skip violently and lose traction. The Huracan first hit the left crash barrier and then the right barrier, after which the Lamborghini slid into a ditch on the side of the motorway.

After the Huracan crash, the 36-year-old male driver climbed out of the car and dragged his passenger out; the car burst into flames shortly after. The driver was taken to hospital in an ambulance, while the passenger was air-lifted with serious injuries."

&gt;"Ugly crashed a Lamborghini Huracan the M7 motorway Szegerdő height on the right track towards Nagykanizsa the basis of initial information on the Czech license plates sports car veered off have been cleared from the road, tore the tape barrier and a drainage ditch cloudy, then caught fire." - calculated in September 2014 the exotic Italian sports car accident happened.

&gt;You can also "unexplained reason," featured in the article, but now the video released by police finally reveal the circumstances of the accident. No flying cows, alien invasion, or a simple heart attack caused by slipping, but the fact that the driver plenty of over 300 km / h pushed the Hungarian court, that tried it, what he's capable of 610 horsepower V10 engine specialty. The accelerator pedal is not said no. 

&gt;After the accident, the driver got out of the passenger Huracanból and rescued from the wreck, after which the car caught fire. The car so say goodbye to the 36-year-old has run amok, and it is certain that in the near future appearance before a court of law because of the Somogy County Police investigating the impeachment proposal documents sent to the district attorney's office Kaposvar.

|-| cnu75dd || -17 || Fuck the Japanese. Racist cunts. Where was the racial diversity? 

Japan is just as economically prosperous as any White Western country. It should therefore be just as attractive to immigrants. 

They also have extremely low birth rates. Therefore, they should allow mass foreign immigration in order to enrich their society and keep it going economically. 

That they insist on maintaining strict and xenophobic immigration policies and that their society continues to function just fine without foreigners sends a terrible message to the White Western world. Their continued success without racial diversity is basically telling racist, far-right political movements in the West that they have the most sensible political platforms. Is that really the message that Japan wants to send to the rest of the world?

Japan desperately needs to open its borders to mass Muslim immigration, mass Mexican immigration and mass African immigration. If they don't, they'll never experience the blessings of diversity.   |-|

My friends ex-gf wanted to have her bday party at this swanky hotel. She wanted to rent the most expensive suite and party it up with her closest friends.  Then all of a sudden we were expected to split the cost after she had already booked the room and not even consulted anyone. So we said we were not going as we didn't have the kind of money (and we didnt really like her). She hounded us every week for the money that "we owed her". Thankfully they broke up like a month later and she moved to FL to be some "rapper's" gf and got arrested in a prostitution ring. |-|

|-| cnu8wlx || 14 || Yeah I gotta say as I've gotten older I have more respect for these guys and the work they do. Its a tough job getting all the stunts right. People who always complain that wrestling is fake don't really understand whats going on. It'd be like going onto a stage in the middle of a play and complaining that none of the actors are really the characters they are playing. |-| 
|-| cnu8wsv || 35 || The awkwardness was palpable. I cringed at how he tried to play it off. |-| 
|-| cnu8x07 || 30 || I had some asshole do the opposite to me as well. I found him with half his car on the road, and the other side in a pretty steep ditch, two or three feet deep. I went home and got a chain and my dads truck and hooked him up and pulled him out. As soon as he was on the street he just slammed on the brakes and bent my dads bumper.

I learned how to do it when I was 16, so please correct me if I'm wrong, but for towing you slowly back up till the rope/chain/strap is tight. Then you gradually increase the throttle to help maintain traction.

For a long distance tow, the car in the front can use the gas to make the pair of cars go, and the car in the back can use its brakes to make the pair of cars stop. The guy in the front never brakes. In that way, the strap always stays tight and you don't have to worry about the hooks falling off (if using a chain) or creeping forward to retighten it. |-|

|-| cnu9zau || 36 || that movie "KIDS" mentions this club I do believe |-| 
|-| cnu9zhn || 49 || Kids parties are terrible to plan. If you're doing it at some kind of party place then you need a decent estimate of the number of kids and they'll charge you for a minimum even if that many don't show up. So you send out 20 invitations and request an RSVP, but only one kid's parents actually let you know they're coming. You call the few others you know, but there's always 15 kids who you haven't heard back from.

The day of the party comes and all 20 kids show up. You'd just turn away the ones who didn't RSVP except that it's your kid's party and he wants his friends there so you can't do that. Hopefully the party place can accommodate the extra 10 kids because you told them you'd be lucky to have the minimum 10 kids show up.

So, from another perspective, if you RSVP to a party, the parents will have paid for your kid to be there. If it costs 16 quid for laser tag or bowling and pizza, then that's what it cost the parents. They probably had to pay up front and can't get back any money for a kid who doesn't show up. So, yeah, it's rude to send an invoice, but it's extremely rude to RSVP and then bail.

To put it another way, if you and your friend were going to go see a movie and you bought both your tickets ahead of time, then your friend bailed on you, you'd deserve your money back for your friend's ticket, right? This is the same thing, except that they're using their kid to make them seem like victims when they're actually just douche bags who don't care about how their actions harm other people. |-|

I personally think both families are kinda douchey.  The one family RSVP'd that their child would attend and then allowed their child to flake rather than teaching him to stick to his social commitments.  They didn't even get in contact with the people holding the party to let them know they'd be a no-show even though the phone number was on the initial invite.  I've read so many stories on Reddit from people talking about how they'll never forget the one time nobody showed up to their birthday party and it's because of people like this, people who RSVP and don't show up, that terrible stuff like that happens.

|-| cnud0sh || -7 || I know it's a tired complaint, but I really can't understand how anyone can watch this. I always try to watch these videos with an open mind, expecting to see something enjoyable... but my god, it doesn't even *remotely* look real. At all.

How is this entertainment? If movies looked this ridiculous and fake, you'd NEVER go see them. But it's acceptable because it's pro wrestling?

I'm also a huge MMA/UFC fan, so it's not like it's the machismo that's turning me off. It's just way, *way* too fake. The suspension of disbelief is just too great. |-| 
|-| cnud1dp || 3 || I wonder how these kids would function if they move anywhere else.  |-| 
|-| cnud1eo || -4 || omg it would be such a nightmare growing up there. especially for 18 to 24 year old males, because im pretty sure this place has 30% more males than females. Which means about 1 in 3 males simply cannot get a girlfriend due to lack of females. 1/3 of your male population being incel is awful.

 If i was growing up there I would get the fuck out as soon as I could. I imagine when the males turn 18 and graduate they are immediately put to work in some blue collar job. So the life of 1/3 of the males in that town is: get up, go to work, go home to your non existent gf/wife because theres no fucking women in the "town" and be bored, lonely, and miserable because theres nothing to do and the weather sucks. I wonder what the suicide rate for this town is.   |-|

About 35 years ago, I saw the same thing from the driver's seat. 

We were on Route 91 heading to go skiing. There was a wreck and traffic came to a halt. 

Me...in my '77 little tiny Honda Civic...watched in horror as a bigass truck came flying up, noticed too late and I told my wife (at the time) hang on hon cuz' we're about to get slammed.

Well, that truck fishtailed and slid and wound up passing on our left at about 30 miles an hour, finally rolling over in a ditch. Missed us by two feet tops! And in that Honda? Certain death. 

I watched it all...didn't have a camera back then.

|-| cnuew0o || 7 || For anyone saying that the driver is to blame in this situation I understand where you're coming from. If I had just seen a random video like this on the internet I would agree that going this fast in conditions like this is extremely negligent. However I drove 2 and a half hours yesterday from New Jersey to Northern Pennsylvania and after experiencing the road conditions yesterday I have to say that almost no one was to blame for the accidents that occurred.

In the early morning it was just a light drizzle. Not a big deal, I just put on my windshield wipers and slowed down a bit to around 65. It wasn't until I tried braking around a corner at 7:30 am that I realized something wasn't right. I was approaching a slight bend in the road a little past Philly and started to lightly brake. All of a sudden the back of my truck swung around and I was heading right for the guardrail dividing the road and the next exit. In a split second I went from being perfectly fine to in a slide at 60+ mph heading straight towards eminent death. 

Luckily, I managed to gain control again before I reached the exit and slowed down drastically to around 20 mph. There were still cars, clueless to what was going on, flying by at normal speeds. In the next 15 minutes I witness dozens of crashes, including a 6 car pileup which I was right behind. These were still nothing compared to the stories on the news. As I kept driving I noticed that the main issue were the bridges. You basically had to keep a constant speed and coast over them, any sudden changes would send you sliding.

Therefore, there is no way that I could blame the truck driver for being negligent. He was assuming that it was nothing more than rain yesterday, an assumption that was perfectly valid up until the flash freezing occurred. There's a reason why there were so many accidents yesterday. The conditions changed in a split second and there was no warning what's so ever.

tl;dr The ice was a surprise to everyone yesterday. This truck driver had no way to know that it was there. Stop blaming him for being negligent. |-|

|-| cnuez5y || 4 || Reminds me of when I was helping a customer put a treadmill in his truck. It was folded up so the running deck was vertical, which is one of the best ways to transport. You fold it up and lay it down so the rolling wheels and the handles are resting on the ground, or in this case the bed of his pickup. But he had one of those steel tool boxes that sits in the bed behind the cab. So, I am in the bed of the truck and the customer and one of the other employees are on the other side of the treadmill where the motor is. We lift it up fine and i lay the folded deck down on top of the tool box and pull it back as far as it can go which is about and inch from the back window of the cab. Now I look back and all I see is the customer lift the tailgate up against the base of the treadmill and push, hard. He cracked the driver side rear window of the cab. I was speechless and the customer had this look on his face that he was angry but couldn't take it out on me cause it was his fault. That was one of the worst sounding crunches i have ever heard. Didn't do any damage to the treadmill though.  |-|

Got round the corner and when he pulled out into traffic he just floored it like this, pulled my whole front bumper off. Ended up having to pay for someone professional to come collect my car there and then, whilst I waited on the side of the road beside my broken ass car. The area I was living in was mostly other students, so it was pretty embarrassing standing there like an idiot as they drove by. Also had to replace the bumper myself because the guy towing my car apparently didn't do anything wrong. |-|

The ship would arrive around 9 or 10 at night, so the crew would all get off and go to the one bar that was there and get drunk. I don't know if it was because we were in town (probably) but the bar didn't close until there was daylight. It was an unwritten rule amongst crew that when passengers asked about anything to do in whittier at night we just told them the entire town closed and they might as well wait until morning.

There are other buildings there, I remember there being this little cafe that had quite the range of menu items, nothing was fantastic but the old couple that came up in the summers to run it were incredibly nice and they would always listen to anything we asked. We got them to make poutine for us regularly (no curds unfortunately, but cheese anyways), something they had apparently never heard of before.

There was also this brand new hotel there, but for the life of us, we couldn't figure out who would be staying there... |-|

|-| cnujq2a || 654 || Guys, This guy only has one third of the best conditions to produce these effects through video feedback. 

1. The key condition is to get a camera that is able to make its output to the TV in negative colors. That way when the camera sees the negitive on the screen, it negates that back to regular. 

2. The other condition is to have a camera that can mirror it's output. So when the camera sees it's own mirrored output, it magnifies the effect making much more vivid and long lasting fractal patterns. 

[THIS VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulPmf6ZPPwI&amp;list=FL_Dq1v9jmEdHUtTbRXoJ2tg&amp;index=6) shows the best example of all 3 of the conditions.

*Note* At **1:36** you can see him turn on the "negative output" mode
         
At : **3:42** you can see him turn on the mirror mode.

Finally--- At **5:15** you can see he somehow injects color into the mix and amazing things happen. I hope someone follows this guide for the best example of this phenomenon I've found.

And there are houses not that far away. Winter can get pretty harsh there, and the fact that there aren't a lot of people there, which makes the whole living in one building so convenient. There is also a pedestrian underground tunnel to "Downtown" Whittier (not much of a downtown at all), so people can avoid the winter weather. Some hotels there too, not too bad looking, at least the bar I went to was a great place to have a beer. 

I'm pretty sure the reason the tunnel to the town closes at 10:30 is because it's just one or two people working that job, and they need to go home too. 

The Buckner Building, old residential quarters for military, is really fun to look through. Seven stories high and extremely haunted looking. It was quite a trip to see all that, and you can still make out the bowling alley they had. People would party there in the summer all the time.

It happens! Somebody in my area was killed a couple of years ago like that.

As a kid on a farm, I once got my dad's pickup truck stuck. He came to pull me out with a tractor and tow strap. With tension on the strap, something on the tractor end slipped off. The strap hook fired right through the grill of the truck and then through the radiator. A little higher and it would have come through the windshield at me |-|

|-| cnumcrd || 6 || Only did shrooms 3 times, but the time I dropped an 8th was epic. Some buds and I went to go see alice in wonderland in 3D. My lord that was something....

Anyways, we were walking down the streets of Austin when we decide to go to my friends car. I had a bag of skittles in there from before and after we rolled in the grass for an hour we decided to book. I told my friend I had to put the skittles up to which he replied "why?"

Let me tell you something, when you're on shrooms and come to the revelation that you can CARRY SKITTLES IN THE BAG DOWN THE STREET, IT IS LIFE ALTERING. Any normal sane person or idiot for that matter who was sober wouldn't have reacted like that. But me? Hell to the no baby, it was GO TIME. I strolled down the drag like I had just come out of a brothel. In that moment my life was changed: I controlled the skittles, I was in charge of each delicious piece (especially the red ones ohhhhh yea). When all the skittles were gone, it was a conquering moment. I knew I coulda left them all in that car but I chomped down everyone and didn't care of the consequences. 

The rest of the night was filled with laughter, touching bricks that appeared to be breathing, and some dmt to top it all off...college was fun |-|

|-| cnuq1l9 || -6 || The title asserting that this is what a *dignified* death *actually* looks like insinuates that anything other than this method is not honorable or respectable to which I say, "Bullshit." I watched two grandparents die of cancer with hospice workers coming around when they could and this method is no more dignified than succumbing to an illness. 

Furthermore dignity is something a person gains after a lifetime of actions, achievements, and contributions. It is not flippantly handed out according to which method you choose to die with. That's an absurd notion.

*Dignity: the state or quality of being worthy of honor or respect.*

For example, self serving people who never help anyone out or contribute anything to society do not suddenly become dignified because they decide to end their life on their own terms. No, they were always worthless to everyone, and especially dishonorable towards themselves.

Having said all that I believe people should have the right to end their life like this if they so choose. I just think labeling this method an *actual* dignified death, as opposed undignified, is completely asinine. It is trying to force acceptance of a subjective standard through the use of colorful language. |-|

"But shooting in California poses some challenges when employing a real baby given the state's strict laws (part of the movie was shot in Los Angeles). Infants must be at least 15 days old, and babies from that age up to six months can be employed for only one period of two consecutive hours in any given day. Moreover, that time frame has to be between 9:30-11:30 a.m. or from 2:30-4:30 p.m., and one studio teacher along with one nurse must be on set during filming." |-|

It's a shame that so many people in healthcare - many of whom are incredibly supportive of measures such as this, are bound by laws that do not allow them to aid in things like we just saw.

In nursing school one learns about the bioethical principal of "do no harm" (nonmaleficence).  

I cannot help but think that this term is subjective, and that *not* letting human beings die in a manner of their choosing in situations such as this is in direct violation of this principal.

|-| cnuutzi || 3 || An old friend of mine is in the hospital and its just a waiting game. Hes not strong enough to sit up properly so they have him in a bed and rub topical anesthetic on his knees and sidate him. I was told by his daughter that he was not eating anything, but they were able to get one of those shot/sample of baileys for him. They Put a straw in it and lifted it to his face, but being the stuborn and strong-willed old man he is, he grabbed the bottle, threw the straw to the side, and slapped away any hand that wasn't his. Everyone said  sip it and take it slow, but he downed it like he was in college again, then had a nice peaceful smile--which was surprising seeing he didnt really smile at super corny jokes or visiters. 

I don't expect anyone to read this/it will probably get lost, so sorry this is only halfway relevant, I just need to vent. I'm in 3rd year uni with not so good grades, but everyone seems to see me doing big things in politics (I haven't really told anyone my GPA), but Alf has been a big player in parks and rec and transportation in Edmonton, across cities in Canada, and around the world (as an advisor), and he out of everyone I know, has the most faith in me. I'm not even blood related but he talks about me to people in his retirement home and to his children. I haven't been visiting him recently due to school and stupid excuses, and was not aware that he has been in the hospital for three weeks now. I feel extreme guilt for not spending more time with him. The last time I visited him we watched second world war documentaries, and he had just gotten all his family photos uploaded to his computer so he showed me those, we talked and he gave me general advice for my life and poitics, and he told me stories about is late wife and his travels. He had an amazing life, a marriage that seemed as close to perfect as anyone can hope for, and a career in which he fought for the environment and the good of the people. I wish I had realized how much he meant to me before he moved to the senior's home (which by the way was amazing and nothing like the homes I have seen through the media). He is the best of us an it hurts to see him like this, he is so frail and in so much pain. 

To Alf: I love you buddy. You will finally get what you wanted; you'll see your wife soon. |-|

Slight correction, but the distance from earth to the sun times 11 is a pretty large margin of error.

|-| cnv3zli || 65 || While it wasn't nearly as extreme as this, I had a similar thing happen to me.

I was in Canada, visiting my ex-girlfriend's family... and yes, the young woman in question was my ex-girlfriend *at the time*. (There's a long story behind how that particular set of circumstances arose, but the short of it is that we'd both already purchased plane tickets and decided that the trip might be our chance to get back together.) The girl's mother - who is normally a very nice woman - had been in a less-than-stellar mood for most of the trip, and one of her handful of breaking points came when we were about five minutes late for a ferry.

Now, a ferry is anything but a small boat. For all intents and purposes, it's a multilevel waiting room that someone stacked on top of moderately sized parking lot and then shoved out into the water. There's a lot of protocol and planning that goes into each fate-defying voyage, which makes it absolutely absurd to suggest that a single person could request a delay. As it happened, though, my ex-girlfriend's mother wanted the ferry to *turn around*, because our group had been five minutes late in arriving to the terminal.

When this horrible truth dawned on the woman, her first course of action was to approach the only administrator in sight - a lowly and likely underpaid ticket salesman - and *demand* that the boat be returned. When that failed to yield any results, she started making various empty threats, ranging from complaining to superiors to actually involving the authorities. Unfortunately, no amount of shouting, pleading, or attempted bribery was sufficient to bring back the boat, and we were forced to wait the extra hour for the next one to arrive.

A couple of days later, she actually found a way of blaming me for it all... but that's a different story.

Father James Lavelle: I've always felt there's something inherently psychopathic about joining the army in peacetime. As far as I'm concerned, people join the army to find out what its like to kill someone. I hardly think that's an inclination that should be encouraged in modern society, do you? Jesus Christ didn't think so, either. And the commandment "Thou shalt not kill" does not have an asterisk beside it, referring you to the bottom of the page where you find a list of instances where it's okay to kill people.

Milo Herlihy: What about self defense?

Regardless of whether the war was legitimate or necessary. 

I have several friends who were over there, fighting, and it inevitably causes you to think in certain ways and have certain beliefs that regular civilians will not understand. When you see the atrocities that the so called "Allah-fearing" residents of the middle east commit, it is extremely hard to not feel strongly.

Sure I can see it from different perspectives, but the fact of the matter is that no matter how hard we try, individuals represent groups. And the group of the Middle East often brings to mind terrorism when Americans think it, and Cultural Invading Immigrants when the English think it. That is probably why war is still going on in the Middle East.

George Washington and Thomas Jefferson owned slaves and abused them just as much if not more than everyone in America at that time. But I don't knock my founding fathers just because they did horrible things to my people.

This man is a hero and followed orders, and he was the best at it. There is no reason to discredit his patriotism just because his world views don't match yours.

Not having friends after many years of marriage, I had no support network and fell into a deep depression. My house went into foreclosure and I had to panhandle to get by. Now I use the internet at the public library. Sharing my fabulousness with the world has left my life in shambles. I don't recommend it.  |-|

|-| cnv6b0g || 327 || They stop selling tickets 15 before the sailing at Tsawwassen.  It can be frustrating if the boat is there but the ticket sales person is following the rules.  This has never happened to me (and I've been in this spot many times) I think if you're nice they'll let you try.  However judging how there's nobody in line I'm imagining the boat has sailed, there's always people trying to get on last minute. |-|

On one hand, she might be a spoiled bitch. On the other hand, she might have just found out her father was on his deathbed and this was the last time to reconcile a huge family rift.  Maybe on the way to this boat her car broke down and she left it knowing it'd be towed. Then She had to hitch a ride getting there just 5 minutes to late. 

Yes, those are contrived examples, but any of a thousand bad things could have happened to her and this was the last straw. This was the thing that pushed her over the edge. You don't know. While the behavior might be unacceptable, it might at least be understandable.

|-| cnv6j0b || 5 || Couple things here: 

1) Yes he is glorified as a hero but thats the same for all war heroes really of all generations (I'm talking through the ages here as well, I.e. the stories of the Romans invading, etc.). You don't think our grandfather and great grand fathers did some fucked up stuff in WWI and WWII of course they did. In these scenarios for soldiers its the old fight or flight, or I'm dead or your dead so the mentality of soldiers changes. Plus you aren't there seeing your friends die in front of your eyes while holding him like a lot of these vets did its definitely gonna change your perspective. Example a German Shepard almost bites off your hand as a kid odds are you are gonna hate them where as I love them (little less extreme but its to get the point across). Experiences change you drastically (can even chemically in your brain)

2) Everyone is going on about how stupid war is and yes its ridiculous the things we fight over when everyone is the same but we are humans and we strive to be the alpha male in any scenario (power and resources). As well this doesn't apply to the middle east conflict really, but the world needs someone to police and it just so happens America is the most fit whether people care to admit it or not. I'm not saying its ideal or right but its the fact of the matter if we start letting people do what they want (I.e. currently Putin and Kim Jong-Un) we could end up with another world war.

Sorry for long rant but just trying to make some points a lot of people don't see in these conflicts. I'm not defending or saying its right what the military does all the time but its sometimes necessary. 

Edit: editing some spelling |-| 
|-| cnv6j1o || 1124 || I work at an airport. Unfortunately, this type of thing isn't too uncommon. I witnessed a lady who missed her flight because she was outside smoking. No one was at the gate because they were sending the flight off. She began banging on the jetbridge door, screaming, and crying. I honestly thought she was going to break the glass door. 

After that was unsuccessful, she walked behind the counter and started talking on the radios (to our airline operations who have no idea who the hell was calling them) and making PAs over the entire terminal of a huge, major metropolitan airport. She was clearly having a serious breakdown.

It was funny like this video is, but upon further reflection, I have no idea what's going on in these peoples' lives. They may be going to a funeral or they just ended a lifelong marriage after they were cheated on. We just can't know. It's no excuse for behavior like this, however.

**TL;DR: Work at airport and saw a lady act very similarly to missing a flight by screaming, crying, making calls over public address system.**

He wrote a fucking book basically just gassing himself up. This guy is definitely someone who joined the military for all the wrong reasons - for bragging rights, for the automatic respect so many give him. My dad is military, and in my experience being around military men and women all my life, those who talk about it a lot are almost invariably huge assholes or really narcissistic. I respect the fact that Chris Kyle served my country, but I can't respect him as a person. I'm sorry the guy was killed, for the sake of his family, but I think we need to let our fascination with the guy die.  |-|

They cut off sales for the boat *ten minutes* before it's scheduled to sail.  This is to allow time for people to go from the ticket booth onto the boat.  Understandable.  But, if you are a young and able bodied person, and you *really* want to make the boat, you'd want to run for it.  

I have missed a boat because the teller was dealing with slow-ass tourists, and then had to cut off ticket sales.  I could have made a run for it and made it.  

I was livid.  

Dealing with the ferry system on a regular basis is bad enough, but throw in this ten minute cutoff that makes you miss a boat, and, well, I would sound like a tea kettle too.

|-| cnv9e83 || 3 || BCF Employee here: the reason she had a tantrum was most likely due to the 15 minute cut off for ticket purchases put into effect 3 years ago. This was due to selling tickets to disabled and elderly people 5 minutes prior to sailing where an able body could make it, and elderly/ disabled could not. As you can imagine, those who have been sailing for 15+ years were pretty pissed when this new rule came into effect. Depending on the sailing, every minute the boat was late could range from $1,000-$10,000 in expenses. |-|

|-| cnvah79 || 10 || Being on a SEAL team and serving in the fleet navy (or any other branch) are polar opposites of "typical" military life.  I have some insight into the Team community (although I'm not attached to one) and to be quite honest, I've loathed most operators I've met. Nonetheless, It lends me the unique perspective in that you respect what they do and how consistently they do it even though you don't agree with their moral compass or underlying principles that started the conflict to begin with. 

Perspective:
The U.S. Population is 315 million
And...
ALL branches of the military makeup just .5% of the entire U.S. population

As specwar community populations are generally classified, a reasonable estimation lies somewhere between .1% or .2%. 


TL;DR respect should be given to those elite military units who consistently perform under austere conditions.  Don't agree with the politics or economics if you like. It's about the people.

Yeah, if people have to be somewhere *really* important for whatever reason, they should take every precaution to make sure they don't miss it, but not everyone is that smart. Just because someone acts like a dick or simply overreacts, that doesn't mean it's not really affecting them. Imagine if you had a parent on their death bed and you missed a ferry or flight or the wedding of a best friend or something? Again, yes, I'm acknowledging that not having redundancies built into your plans is a moron move, but it wouldn't change the impact it would have on the people. I know this is the Internet, and Reddit, and that it's asking a lot, but try to see things from the other person's point of view now and then. |-|

He was a little bit of a local legend because he was tranquilized and taken back up to the mountains three times, but always made his way back to the town, swimming in people's pools and eating food sitting out. He was named Meatball because he snuck into one persons house and ate their Costco meatballs. Eventually, because he just kept coming back, they had to take him to a sanctuary in Colorado.[Here's the video with the news station stuff still in it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0pJgaZd_Aw). |-|

|-| cnvdhjm || -5 || Thankyou kind sir for alerting me of the amazing video.  |-| 
|-| cnvdluf || 5 || You know, something that causes someone to freak out like this shouldn't be taken lightly.  There's clearly something very important she needs to get to, and the dumb asshole with the camera "huhuhuh i got the whole thing huhuhuh!" that was irritating as shit to listen to.

If some horrible accident had you stuck in traffic and you needed to get to a job interview, or as another poster said "father's death bed" and you were told you JUST missed it, you might boil over.

NONE OF US knows how we will act when the stress gets to a point where it takes over the rational part of your mind.  Some might scream, some might cry.  At least TRY and have some empathy, don't just bust out a camera and laugh at the poor girl.

TL;DR:  Fuck the guy filming and fuck all of you.   |-|

|-| cnvf0hs || 218 || I really love how the lack of detail was used to portray the soldier's fear/confusion. This is a super cool animation, you guys def. deserve all the recognition you get from this, and probably more.  |-| 
|-| cnvf1yr || 4 || A lot of people are giving her shit for her behavior, and while I certainly don't condone temper tantrums, there are any number of reasons should could have missed the ferry. 

This is from Vancouver Island, my home. I've caught this ferry more times than I can count. I can assure you that unless you show up consistently 4-5 hours early, you *will* miss the ferry at some point. The highway going from Victoria (the island's major city) to the ferry terminal isn't too far -- maybe a half-hour/forty-five minute drive -- but it's absolute shit. It's max 4 lanes wide and can barely be considered a highway by most major cities' standards. Traffic jams are a regular occurrence. (It also doesn't help that they built this [pointless clusterfuck](http://vibrantvictoria.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/McTavish-interchange.gif) that you need to pass through to get to the ferry terminal and airport.) They also give priority to truck drivers going to and from the mainland, so even one of the huge ferries can become half-full before a single civilian is loaded. I couldn't even guess the number of hours I spent as a kid just dicking around the terminal because we missed the boat we were aiming for.

Which is all to say that this woman could have an emergency in Vancouver, a legitimately unfair reason for missing the ferry, and might not be totally in control of her emotions. |-| 
|-| cnvf2jh || 7 || This is really awesome. Since you seem like you were involved to some degree, can you go into some detail about this? Where the idea came from to do it this way, where the story came from, etc. |-| 
|-| cnvf2se || 9 || I've seen your other videos on YT long ago and immediately subscribed because I liked your humour.

None of them have ever been in the military and obviously show the typical liberal anti-American sentiments that characterize Obama and everything else that's wrong with the liberal Democratic Party, not to mention the spoiled, elitist liberal attitudes of Michael Moore and Seth Rogan.

Chris Kyle did more to promote the solution to the radical Islamist movement than all the hate-filled posters in this thread.

|-| cnvfnnc || 39 || The choice of paper was very relevant and the theme amplified through the backlighting. The sense of chaos was overwhelming at times but well contrasted through the stiller moments. There were times where scenes just merged not through subject alone but through shape and metamorphosis even. One cannot help but feel lost and yearning for the bigger picture, but the journey of the soldier as the short progresses opens up into the subject of finding his sense of purpose. We too as an audience reflect on the short journey of the soldier and we grow as he does. The process of this growth is just simply superbly magnified through the unique process of the animation. Moments were intense and intimate when they needed to be. It seems like a story we are all to familiar with, but it is clear that in this direction it is made more authentic with surreal qualities. I admire the hand drawn process alone and of course what it has amounted to. It is unclear whether the sound at the end is a helicopter, but for me it gave me reassurance that he has not been left alone and there is closure. This is after all the soldier the audience has grown with.  |-|

If it was a protest she would have done it then ran away. Or better yet actually protest in a way that would make a difference.

Dunkin Donuts box means this was really planned out. She went to the store to get the bacon, went to Dunkin to get a box, cut open the package so she probably had some sort of cutting tool in her car (rare for people who don't work in some sort of labor job.) and then walked in there with a box of raw bacon to throw.

|-| cnvl773 || 25 || Once I missed the 7pm express ferry from Milwaukee to Michigan and the next one wasn't until the next afternoon. I drove right to the loading point, and the boat was still there and tethered, but, being "so close" to 9/11, it was "too scary" for the loaders (security), and they said no. I just sat there a few minutes in disbelief, then went to the office to see what I had to do. It was a Friday evening meaning traffic in Chicago would've made the drive unbearably long - 6+ hours if lucky.


I kept my cool (wasn't easy) and asked the office if they had any suggestions, and one person indicated there was a "Badger" service from Manitowoc, WI that left at midnight. What the hell I thought. 


Drove up to Manitowoc (about 90 minutes north), got a ticket and waited. Boarded at midnight. I noticed they didn't care at all about 9/11 - there was really no security of any kind. 


Got on board and noticed they had lots of chairs on the deck in front. Grabbed one, settled in and about an hour later after dozing off, I wake up, look up at the sky and..

OH. MY. GOD.

The stars you can see from the middle of Lake Michigan on a clear moonless night will take your breath away. Hell of a great memory.

|-| cnvlh01 || 19 || Something about this, especially the lack of dialogue and knowing anything about the characters involved- and the way that it just ends when the encounter ended, without any climax or plot point to drive something home reminds me of a passage from *The Things They Carried* about *true* war stories. I'll have to find the direct quote.

&gt; In a true war story, if there's a moral at all, it's like the thread that makes the cloth. You can't tease it out. You can't extract the meaning without unraveling the deeper meaning. And in the end, really, there's nothing much to say about a true war story, except maybe "Oh." True war stories do not generalize. They do not indulge in abstraction or analysis.
For example: 'War is Hell' As a moral declaration the old truism seems perfectly true, and yet because it abstracts, because it generalizes, I can't believe it with my stomach. Nothing turns inside.


&gt;It comes down to gut instinct. A true war story, if truly told, makes the stomach believe. |-|

About The Video:

At a time when Americans are scared, jobless, and homeless, we wanted to create a comedy that would resonate with how Americans are feeling. We are Scott Rose and Ernie Brandon, a screenwriting duo in Los Angeles, and we don't have anything to give back to America except for belly laughs. This video is a teaser for our new comedy screenplay about what it means to be a little guy in the land of giants. This is our Christmas gift to the working class. |-| 
|-| cnvttr9 || 3 || I always hate the sound of Gordon Ramsey cutting food.  |-|

|-| cnvu8zq || 81 || I like how (pre-fart) the dog is opening his eyes just a sliver as though he knows something is up. "The human is pointing that contraption at me again. Surely I'm about to be humiliated." |-| 
|-| cnvu916 || 8 || Some good little movie throw backs in there-Archers car is Bullitt's '68 Ford Mustang, and the VW Bettle from the chase seen in the same film also is visable.  |-|

|-| cnvuclq || 144 || Wheat enough practice, you can make chicken, OP. |-| 
|-| cnvuldt || 4 || us army vet. 2 tours of iraq; one of afghanistan.

for me the scariest part of this was when he is separated from the other two. we don't know if they're dead or where they went. the ambiguity of the ending makes you question if it was a friendly-fire incident, but i think the point was that it doesn't really matter. what mattered was trying to survive.

two things that gave me slight comfort while there was my training and most importantly were the people to my right and left, knowing they had my back and me, theirs.

so yeah, seeing him alone made me very anxious.

writing this helps. that and the cigarette I'll be smoking right after this.

very intense, excellent sounds. very  well done.

|-| cnxalvf || 45 || What? That was fucking terrible. |-| 
|-| cnxas2b || 4 || It's not really eye-opening. The media has always functioned on drama, and no matter how unethical it is, people will be taught to provoke reactions as long as they can edit it later. The media has ALWAYS shown what will get them higher ratings, what will get their video clips and articles circulated on the internet, and basically whatever will extend their reach. National networks have functioned like this, and it's unlikely things will change.


Put it in perspective. When's the last time you tuned into your local news station? Do you even know if your town has a local news station? That's because without provocation or a significant event, people generally tend to behave like normal people. Local stations know exactly what their reach is, so there is no reason for them to try and create drama where there is none.


And just like not all Muslims are terrorists, not all news networks do this, but it's pretty difficult to find a good reliable source for news nowadays because "journalists" seem to be exercising more control on the tone of the news like they're documentary directors. |-|

As a Muslim, every time I saw videos of certain Muslims acting like this to a cameraman and reporter I thought that that Muslim was just an aggressive person, it is the reason why he was on camera and the media was showing only that, every time people said that those Muslims are calm people and the guys behind the camera and microphone provoke them I would dismiss it.


This actually shows that the news reporters and cameramen are actually the same as the TMZ reporters that harass celebrities on the street, this of course doesn't state that every cameraman and reporter is like this but damn, as a reporter you have the power of the media, you are supposed to show everything in a neutral light, provoking someone and then showing them in a bad light isn't what you are supposed to do. |-|

But if it's true that the victims in this video were guilty of rioting during the Oakley riots, depicted here:

If that's true and they are guilty, then I personally don't feel sorry for them and I am upset that the story is now changed where they're a victim.

I've been asked to stop recording and always do it, it's easier to just tell your boss you didn't feel comfortable/it wasn't appropriate than it is to have your boss get an angry phone call and have to deal with that. You also never make comments to people like that, you're there to observe not participate. Most local news is on the up and up but you always get that one station that has a producer that is trying to stir shit up because they're trying to make a name for themselves. 

That guy was going to get fired sooner or later, you're at the mercy of the public and its officials when it comes to getting your story and the last thing you want is a bad reputation around town.  |-|

To put how dangerous it is to live there in perspective, if you live in the US, ask an American if they know anyone that knows anyone that was murdered. Most often the answer is no and if it is a yes, it's usually 3 or 4 people removed. I know 4 people within one degree of me that are no longer with us. I am not a gang banger, I didn't run in bad circles, it's simply a fact of life in SA. 

On top of those incidents my home was robbed multiple times, my mom, dad and grandparents were hijacked, my brother in law woke up with a gun in his face in his own home, one of my friends was raped, I've been shot at several times (missed thank goodness), and the list goes on. 

When I speak to folks back there, they say it's getting better yet they have to live in gated communities, behind barbed wire and electric fences, looking over their shoulders all the time.

Saying "please" in a confrontational manner doesn't somehow excuse the hothead. I would think reddit understands that.

Cameraman overstepped his bounds when he said "fuck you" and called someone a "terrorist," yes. But those Muslim guys got nasty first. Nothing would have happened if they just walked away. I have no doubt that camera man was scared before he said a word.

|-| cnxkec3 || 23 || I'm really not sure if I can pinpoint what bugged me about this version.  I think Ice-T definitely gave it a good shot, and it was enjoyable for the most part, but I really think that the spirit of the cover was different from the original.

ST's version really comes across as the voice of disaffected youth trying to deal with well-intentioned, but severely disconnected authority figures.  Something I think that a lot of teens connect with.  The voice of Mike really comes across as rational (to himself/the audience) and just trying to push the pressure of how to act from those around him away.

I think where Ice-T's version misses the mark is that it really just comes across as a "First World Problems" song.  I want to do something, someone/thing is complaining about it/preventing it, anger ensues, complain that someone sees the anger as irrational.

I think where ST's has a subtlety of perspective (a disaffected youth may be acting out, and its irrelevant if it is (ir)rational, their perspective is that it really is a form of persecution.  Again, something that resonates with teens), Ice-T's lacks and turns it mostly into "Ice-T and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day." |-|

The father and his son did rise to the occasion. Right from the get go, rather than going back towards them and yelling for them to stop, why not just keep walking, go to your car, and ignore the shitheads?

Yes the camera man is utter scum, yes he's a racist arsehole who has no place in a job where he has to interact with people... but there would have been no confrontation, no footage, nothing at all if they'd ignored them and just left.

The more people can let bullshit comments not get to them, the better they can get through life. If you get riled up and feel you have to defend your honour every time someone says obvious bullshit to you, you're going to get into fights, you're going to be provoked into things that you sorely wished you weren't later on.

&gt;
&gt;Police said he had no permit for the demolition and didn’t even own the home, which was in his wife’s name. When CBS2’s Tony Aiello saw him briefly Tuesday evening, he wasn’t apologetic. 
&gt;“We’re married. It’s a community asset,” Rheim said Tuesday when asked about the home being in his wife’s name.
&gt;
&gt;“I’m in shock still, that’s the only thing…I’m blank because I’m in shock,” Andryshak said. 
&gt;
&gt;The remains of the living room sofa can be seen in the pile of rubble, all of it placed inside the foundation of where the house stood. The place is dotted with household articles like pots and pants.
&gt;Rhein even left the dog standing outside, CBS2’s Lou Young reported. [...]
&gt;CBS2 was told the house was in need of renovation. The couple had been living elsewhere the past two weeks and have reportedly been behind on mortgage payments as well.
&gt;Husband and wife have barely spoken since the incident.
&gt;
&gt;“The only thing he said to me was, ‘Everything is replaceable.’ I said ‘No it’s not,’” Andryshak said.
&gt;
&gt;Rheim works as a private construction contractor and reportedly borrowed the excavator used to bulldoze the home from a nearby work site.

So an islamic immigrant is graciously given the chance at a better life in a civilized non-muslim country.

What does he do in return? Commit crimes in the very country that allowed him entry of course!

He is then granted BAIL (instead of deportation?) by the generous nation that allowed him to come live in a civilized society, and reporters proceed to do their job which is to document incidents like this.

This angers the muslim immigrant and he DEMANDS that he not be filmed in a public space!

But don't you dare disobey muslim immigrants! They get angry and start acting like terrorists! But don't you dare call them terrorists! That makes them even angrier! How dare an Australian man film in his own country!

|-| cnxsmtr || 3 || That was weird, sad, touching, and creepy all at the same time. |-| 
|-| cnxstq2 || 6 || "Are you Howard Stern?" 

Holy shit, that's the first time I actually laughed out loud in a very long time.  |-| 
|-| cnxsvao || 11 || My dad's pit bull loves the water and diving for stuff. It's hard keeping that dog out of the water during the summer time and from what he's said she's usually the first one in the pool every year. 

I know he has a video of her getting the ball in the deep end but I couldn't find it so it's probably just on Facebook. Here's one of her playing fetch in the shallow end of his pool:

|-| cnxt01z || 19 || Definitely one of the best action flicks in a long time. |-| 
|-| cnxt0gi || -14 || Aaaand of course he's fat. |-| 
|-| cnxt1qk || 3 || Holy shit.  How have I never seen that?  I laughed so hard my stomach cramped up. |-| 
|-| cnxt49w || 4 || Wow. After the whole Payday 2 disaster I didn't care about this movie at all, but this made me really intereseted. While I also really like the club scene in Collateral, the shots in this are so much cleaner and everything is less chaotic. With the way he fights he also kind of fits into Payday now... |-| 
|-| cnxt5jc || 7 || Looks towards camera *alright you filming?*  |-| 
|-| cnxt823 || 5 || What an asshole.  Good luck to that wife. |-| 
|-| cnxtarz || 12 || &gt; "Maybe they're all in the shower. *All* of them." 

This got me. |-| 
|-| cnxtbvt || -6 || Notice how he just goes "shhhh". It's a very commandeering sort of gesture to do that: just to try to silence, it doesn't offer argument (although he does elsewhere), it just says, "be quiet", and he also says "quiet". This reminds me of the recent situation with Cosby and an audience in which he was heckled, and just used this "no", and just tries to tell them to be quiet, basically. Realize that Cosby's brand of rapaciousness was borne very much of Reed's era. |-| 
|-| cnxtdg2 || 3 || He talks about Body Count briefly in this music video from 1991: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Djb3YbRMWGU |-| 
|-| cnxtgg2 || 4 || I was like "this looks like humboldt'. NOPE, Del Norte =) Was just kayaking up on the north fork the other day. Sick dog dude. |-| 
|-| cnxtiuy || 7 || Maybe it's just me, but I didn't find that funny at all. |-| 
|-| cnxtj4e || 3 || [My face after watching this.](http://i.imgur.com/Yzkhck2.png) |-| 
|-| cnxtkau || -12 || I don't get what's so good about it? Just another rambo guy unrealistically taking out dozens of bad guys. That's a new one! |-| 
|-| cnxtl5g || 3 || God I can't believe Keanu is 50...He moves like he's 30. |-| 
|-| cnxtr01 || -3 || I love how the lady is just so impressed that she gives up on the idea of yelling at him just to hear him finish.  |-| 
|-| cnxtr39 || 5 || I wish roller blading was socially acceptable. I did it as a kid and it was so much fun. |-| 
|-| cnxtta9 || 16 || I knew I recognized that face.  http://legendsrevealed.com/entertainment/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/oliver_reed_gladiator.jpg |-| 
|-| cnxtuy1 || 7 || That... was fucking AMAZING... Wow, that's one of the best sing person acapella arrangements I've ever seen. |-| 
|-| cnxtxvk || -4 || This is, uh, really creepy. An adult male unknowingly filming a young boy through the window of his house.  |-| 
|-| cnxu3zd || -5 || Dude... At least post the whole thing... In the whole video it ends up being a prank  |-| 
|-| cnxu5ki || -3 || 'Merica's funniest video ever
 |-| 
|-| cnxu8nc || 12 || I think action films will never be made this way in the west.  There are several factors to this.

*  Jackie Chan was classically trained at the Peking Opera House
*  He was surrounded by a crew of life long stuntmen-buddies
*  His films were so dangerous that he couldn't get insurance for them
*  Time, Jackie was a perfectionist.  He would redo shots over and over while taking huge amounts of punishment.  He's gone on record saying he didn't like filming western films because it was a shoot a scene, and go type of deal
*  Movie stars bruise easily and aren't classically trained.  Some of these stunts are career ending
*  Newer movies like wide swinging punches instead of tight strikes because it looks better, but most trained people will tell you that none of those large swinging moves are good, telegraph, time used, etc. |-|

|-| cnxuc4d || 40 || [Reminds me of Big Bill Hell's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sZuN0xXWLc) |-| 
|-| cnxudci || 8 || Speaking of old funny videos, what's that video where the kid is in a really poorly green-screened flying car with background footage of a small wooden fence and he says something and drives out of the picture? The whole video was less than 10 seconds I think. |-| 
|-| cnxuduk || 5 || He's also been featured in a metalcore bands cover of "[Turn Down For What](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQh7OjYIGWA)" |-| 
|-| cnxui2l || 7 || Any idea what the song is?

Nvm. Kaleida. Think.  |-| 
|-| cnxukq3 || -3 || Oliver Reed fully deserved it.

He was acting like a fucking prick during this interview. |-| 
|-| cnxulpn || -5 || So you're saying it was a shit year for movies? |-| 
|-| cnxupji || 4 || I laughed pretty hard at that, I can't lie. When he shaves himself apart, then falls onto the shavers, flying into pieces, it was just too ridiculous and unexpected not to laugh.  |-| 
|-| cnxusro || 5 || This was me as a child on a few occasions. My neighbourhood had plenty of kids to play with but occasionally no one could come out. There was a circuit I'd do which would take half an hour going to each house repeating the same actions as this boy. When I'd gone round once and knocked, I'd go round again, in case anyone got back from wherever they'd been. And if that still failed I'd go to the park and sit on a swing for an hour, sometimes someone would show up, then walk dejectedly home.

Most of the time shit was awesome, played football and wrestled and shit. But every now and again this happened. |-| 
|-| cnxuto4 || -3 || No. |-| 
|-| cnxux1t || 20 || How is no one addressing the fact of how creepy it was that the neighbor was filming this? |-| 
|-| cnxuyoh || -6 || Stick with me for a second, but I believe this man might be mentally-handicapped:

*  He's in a reclined position as if in a wheelchair

*  He's visibly cross-eyed

*  When he's asked if he's high, he has someone speaking for him

*  He has arm-tremors commonly found in people with problematic brain functions

*  He mouths-words to himself

Note:  This does not preclude him from being stoned.  I'm simply saying he might be mentally-handicapped

A stoned mentally-handicapped man. |-| 
|-| cnxv2f0 || -6 || 1. Unlimited ammo cheat activated. 

2. Champagne bottles would not break that easily. 

3. Theon Greyjoy would not be hanging out naked with ladies, he has no penis.  |-| 
|-| cnxv644 || 4 || This might be the saddest thing I've ever seen posted on reddit.  |-| 
|-| cnxvhzy || 24 || [Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?x-yt-cl=84503534&amp;v=78hq9r56lbw&amp;x-yt-ts=1421914688) explains what happened behind the scenes. |-| 
|-| cnxvkco || -3 || Wow, that was bad.... but pretty food for him, I guess. |-| 
|-| cnxvmd8 || 6 || Stares in the eyes the whole way down.... Brutal   |-| 
|-| cnxvvmj || 3 || good luck getting a rat dog like my mrs wants to do something like this.

i should use this to prove what a real dog looks like  |-| 
|-| cnxvyck || 3 || Before I got done reading the title I thought to myself "emmmhmmm, gotsta be a black lab" my inner monolog is a sassy gay black dude. |-| 
|-| cnxw08k || 11 || I don't agree with Oliver Reed's opinions here but damn, he sure handled that well and was one witty man! I had never seen any interviews with him before. Plenty of films but no interviews. Off to look for more now lol. |-| 
|-| cnxw0uf || 74 || I would argue that the final fight in The Raid 2 was the best action scene of last year |-| 
|-| cnxw3lr || 3 || this is creepy as fuck and just sad  |-| 
|-| cnxw7u1 || 4 || medium... relative to what?

i just about lost it at this point and had to pause it to catch up from the laughing |-| 
|-| cnxwael || -10 || This was a great movie...In opposite land. |-| 
|-| cnxwaru || 3 || Good looking mud puppy.  |-| 
|-| cnxwbgb || -3 || That is the most stupid video I have ever watched, in fact I am now a dumber person because of it. |-| 
|-| cnxwgzt || 3 || Google scuba diving dog - numerous pix of diving dogs |-| 
|-| cnxwjhn || 3 || It's so true. This scene from [Drunken Master from 1978](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IqaHu_o-gw) is one of my favorites (the dub is sort of weird). He pretty much just gets wasted and [beats the hell out of people.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwrqm0Y1UO0)

 |-| 
|-| cnxwn8i || 3 || My dog (labrador/collie) used to love finding rocks in the river and taking them to the opposite side. She used to blow air out of her nose when she had her head under water for a long time to stop the water getting in. |-| 
|-| cnxwqrp || 6 || Yes, I enjoyed this thoroughly, except for one thing:  Why doesn't he shoot Iosef when he's in the pool?  He's obviously trying to kill him, because 10 seconds later he's shooting at Iosef as he runs away! |-| 
|-| cnxwu4b || 5 || This is the version preformed by spongebob

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KztZmZDNCVg |-| 
|-| cnxwuna || 5 || Personally, I like [Smooth McGroove's version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s20588opz4). |-| 
|-| cnxwwn6 || 3 || Not me dude! grew up with 20 kids on my street! shit was awesome! |-| 
|-| cnxwx4j || 15 || Holy shit, that montage of the guy saying "I NEEED YOUR LOVE, YOUR LOOOOVE..." while the guy is stabbing the other guy on the neck, is absolutely stunning. If the point of the director was to impact the audience with that scene, it was a guaranteed hit. Absolutely amazing. I do not like what is happening on screen, but I am amazed by the director language.  |-| 
|-| cnxwx7b || 3 || I have a chocolate lab.  She can dive to the bottom of our 6 foot pool to fetch a ball that has sunk. |-| 
|-| cnxwxs9 || 3 || I clapped and laughed out loud  |-|

|-| cnxwzzo || 4 || idk the raid 2 had some nice actions scenes. |-| 
|-| cnxx09s || 9 || If you like knife fight scenes, you should check out The Man From Nowhere. Insane stuff. |-| 
|-| cnxx0k2 || 4 || No one else is creeped out by Buffalo Bill secretly recording a little boy? |-| 
|-| cnxx1nv || 3 || If Coco was my wife I would never play Xbox. |-| 
|-| cnxx27f || -7 || seems cringey to me to start playing it while people are having a meeting nearby. Makes me think hes a socially awkward neckbeard. |-| 
|-| cnxx6w0 || 105 || Things turned sharply downhill once the Leafs actually took the ice. It has been a brutal season...every season... |-| 
|-| cnxx76f || 3 || That's an evolutionary advantage. Who knows, if natural selection took its course, we'd have a new species of aquatic dogs in a couple hundred thousand years. These traits would be passed on and passed on and passed on until it became genetic code. Really cool |-| 
|-| cnxx7za || 3 || W-What the shit? I feel so POOR now |-| 
|-| cnxx8te || 3 || There's no arguing taste. |-| 
|-| cnxxbuu || 41 || One of the best things about John Wick is that he finish all kills with a headshot, even when the bad guy si already dead, he headshot him

|-| cnxxtes || 3 || I had a dachshund when I was a kid that would dive to the bottom (8ft) of our pool to retrieve the diving rings we used to leave behind. It was amazing to watch; this video reminds me of him.  |-| 
|-| cnxxw1e || -3 || I don't appreciate the commentary. There's nothing funny or humorous about this at all.

edit: Maybe I'm just the only one who sees this lonely kid and feels bad inside. |-| 
|-| cnxxxma || -3 || It looked great, but seriously.. How come bullets do fuck all unless you're shot in the head? Almost every guy he shot just kept coming like nothing happened. Fuck, even he took two to the chest and brushed it off like it was just some minor inconvenience.
 |-| 
|-| cnxxy87 || 3 || Oh fuck yes.  This was awesome.  Something about singing is just so crazy.  You know.. You might hear a song and it really hits you in your heart and you're like "God damn this shit's gonna make me cry" and that just gets my right in my soul because when you think about it, it's simply *how* they are saying their words.  Wow.  Someone can "say" (read sing) something in such a beautiful way it makes you cry? Crazy.

Instead of crying though, this guy funks me up. |-|

|-| cnxygng || 310 || I like when he says 'ass' like they almost had to dub it in.  

And he said 'bitch' in such a way that representing it with text is almost impossible.  |-| 
|-| cnxyoqj || 3 || 6 years in [Go Shorty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l94S1yDJEE) still holds the #1 spot in my heart. |-| 
|-| cnxyr2j || 5 || You can't see it in the video, but he's definitely wearing a fedora. |-| 
|-| cnxys1z || 36 || Honestly, it's really good to see movies having fun with subtitles. The change in location, font, size and color adds it to the scene, rather than leaving it as merely a translation.  |-| 
|-| cnxyuj7 || 3 || I was glad they incorporated a few reloads in there (and a couple changes of pistol). The only part that really bugged me was when he reloads in a doorway. Seems to me that he'd be a pretty obvious silhouette to one of the henchmen as he did that. |-|

It really is a joy to see the innovations of today transcend unto a later generation. When watching your loved ones celebrate their comprehension and usability it is a feeling of happiness that comes full circle.

If he put that bottle in a female's posterior, he would be arrested, but it's somehow okay for him to insert it in a male. It sickens me seeing Reddit support these crimes, shame on you!.

I think one of the biggest issues that will face humanity over the next century is what to do with the tens of millions of laborers who will be replaced by robotics in the coming future. Educated people will perhaps find something to do, but uneducated and unskilled workers will be completely fucked. For instance, imagine when all fast food restaurants simply turn into big vending machines, what will all of those laid off workers do? How could they survive in a capitalistic system? It's not going to be an easy question to answer.  |-|

For instance, at a department award ceremony I received 2 star pins which are awarded for "rescues" from structure fires. It was a big deal at my station as only one other person had a rescue that year in station. The joke of it? I received one pin for pulling a 7 year old out who was covered in 3rd degree burns and died 4 days later, and the other for "rescuing" an 80 year old woman who was cooked so well done that her eyes melted to my facemask as I pulled her out and her skin is still binded to my gear on my shoulder.

|-| co0cbw4 || 33 || For those unfamiliar, David Graeber is the author of a fantastic book called [Debt: The First 5000 Years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years)

&gt;Debt: The First 5000 Years is a book by anthropologist David Graeber published in 2011. It is a wide-ranging book, exploring debt's relationship with money, cash, barter, community, marriage, friendship, vassalage, slavery, morality, honor, law, philosophy, commerce, religion, greed, charity, violence, war and government; in short, much of the fabric of human life in society. It draws on the history and anthropology of a number of civilizations, large and small, from the first known records of debt from Sumer in 3000 BC until the present. It explores how debt has changed and been changed by the people and societies which have used it.

&gt;A major argument of the book is that when the imprecise, informal, community-building indebtedness of "human economies" is replaced by mathematically precise, firmly enforced debts, widespread impoverishment and violence are common results which only a few societies have managed to escape. |-|

|-| co0fcvg || 28 || For anyone who hasn't seen it, check out this video called[ "Humans Need Not Apply" by CGP Grey.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU) It talks about mechanization and essentially the future of "pointless jobs". |-| 
|-| co0ja2o || 42 || Here is why Universal Basic Income isn't going to happen any time soon, at least not in the United States. 

**1. Protestant Work Ethic** - there is a deeply engrained belief, at least in the United States, that "if you don't work, you don't eat." In essence, if you don't work, you don't deserve anything. We've conceptually tied human dignity to labor. Connected to this is...

**2. Anti-Welfarism** - The iconic representation of the welfare queen collecting checks for all children in her Cadillac (an image Ronald Reagan helped make popular, but which was derived an anecdote which has never been substantiated) captures a sense that people who do not work are parasites with low moral character, whose character is weakened with "hand outs." There are a lot of people who go flat broke avoiding public assistance because they are afraid of the stigma.  

**3. Identity.** There is a piece of information which strangers share if they talk for an extended period of time. It comes in the form of a question, "What do you do for a living?" Who we are is defined by what we do. We look down on janitors and look up to doctors. It would be nice to change this, but this tendency is a barrier to change. 

**4. Capitalism requires labor.** Even if labor is illogical, even if a bot or a clever piece of software can do your job, even if you spend half the day on Reddit, this is how it works. The capitalist owns the means of production and distribution and the employee works in the office, factory, or shop. Is it stupid? Sure, but capitalism is an unmitigated God-term in the American lexicon. We envision ourselves as having opportunity by hard work (pull yourself up by the bootstraps) and/or innovation ("Build a better mousetrap!"). The only (alleged) alternatives are "socialism" and "communism." 

**5. The most important reason: They need to keep us occupied.**

An idle mind is the Devil's Workshop. Let people do their own thing and they might start thinking that they have time to take control of their communities. They might form political parties and foment dissent. They will drink more, get into more arguments, commit more crime. 

When you are at work you are a docile body, your location known, your behavior evaluated, your time measured. You get home with just about enough energy to watch TV, have a drink, play a video game, and chat with family and friends. You come home exhausted (sometimes and in some cases not from actual labor, but from having spent the best hours of your day already) and "zone out."  

Americans work long hours, on average about 45 hours a week. A lot of people work more. **It does not matter if it is really hard labor.** Every hour you spend at work is an hour you're not on the street protesting police violence in Ferguson, researching Monsanto, learning what your politicians are really up to, etc. Do you really want 300 million people with guns to have more free time? 

Isn't it funny that the U.S. imprisons more of its population (per capita and in total numbers) than any other nation in the world? Isn't it odd that certain drugs carry stiffer penalties (e.g., poor man's crack v.s. rich man's cocaine)? *Is the war on drugs really a failure?* Depends on what your goal is.  

I think it is more plausible that welfare will expand a bit, but that we will continue to find busy work miraculously appear for us. Expect New Deal type public works projects before universal income. **And the kicker is they will demand that we be grateful for having provided us employment contrary to market forces.** 

This will be the handout. It's what we already have, but they'll just hang a lantern on the reality that we are increasingly engaged in busy work, and they'll call themselves saints for keeping us busy.

|-| co0fq22 || 11 || Oh man, if they think this is a problem in the UK, you should see the US.

We're so good at inefficiency that we pour money into it instead of solving vital problems like repairing our bridges. |-| 
|-| co0ot9o || 15 || I'm sorry, but I just can't get over how yellow this guy's teeth are...  |-| 
|-| co0afbm || 128 || I think he should just cut straight to the point and admit that money is a mechanism of social control and that's why "jobs" exist for the most part and why most central banks have "full employment" listed as one of their core objectives. |-| 
|-| co0a8r0 || 31 || Population is increasing, women entered the workforce en masse decades ago, cost of living is increasing.  If you think millions of people are really "worth" their salary you're mistaken.  Just look at the layoffs after 2008, nobody was worth a damn.

In some ways we're operating a massive ponzi scheme for the overall benefit of everyone.  At least those of us that aren't millionaires |-| 
|-| co0dlpi || 13 || I felt exactly the way Greaber described working away in a well paid, yet pointless job.

My way out was to move into something else, trouble was anything else would pay less, unless I moved.

So to earn money I started building websites in my 'spare time'.  Income started to be generated from these sites.  This allowed me to move into a lower paid, but more worthwhile job.

Now I'm at the stage where I am earning more from the websites than my job and can start thinking about stage two.  No Job.

|-| co0g8pv || 5 || What changes would happen if we moved teaching services online? 

Lets say for this discussion, we took the english speaking countries (USA, Canada, UK, Australia, NZ) which should equate to roughly 400 million people, and we revolutionized high-school &amp; university courses by making these primary online self-serve courses. The government or individual could pay the video creator (could be the professor, university, other) for each view/person. How would this change the world that we know? 

Ideally the video's should be very cheap, allowing anyone with the time to educate themselves to a higher level on any subject that interests them. You should be able to cut back on the majority of education costs,  facilities would be mostly unnecessary along with their staff, I assume you could cut back on half the teachers but would still need many to teach hands-on courses &amp; to make new/improved videos. If we reduced the teach population in half, if we removed 75% of universities, and we eliminated all the student debt that went with it, what would we see happen? How much would the government &amp; individuals save in unnecessary expenses?  |-|

|-| co0dcuj || 15 || If you give people free money every year, shitty (but useful) jobs wont be filled. I work part time in a dishroom while in college and I can tell you that job would most definitely NOT be filled if people didn't absolutely need a job. Is this a good thing? What would be the solution to this? The only thing I can think of is that the dining hall would have to pay a lot of money to get workers to work there. Actually, honestly, that's fair. People should get paid more to do shitty jobs. |-| 
|-| co0krw1 || 3 || If someone gave me 30k British pounds every year I can honestly say I would never work again, and if I did, it'd be very little.

I'm lazy, I don't want to work. If I get to live for free then I will.

Basic income is a bad idea because people like me exist, and are the majority. |-| 
|-| co0qez6 || 3 || If the masses had more time to spend on things such as...say...politics, and what's going on in their communities, it'd be tougher on politicians to push legislation that would hurt the working masses. Can't have that! |-| 
|-| co0r9hk || 3 || A 12 hour work day with two 6 hour shifts for the laborers. Something like a 7:00-1:00 shift for the morning people, and a 1:00-7:00 for the non morningers. Business are open longer, allowing for more business to get done as a whole, but the worker isn't forced to work the whole twelve hours. More free time for laborers, while allowing them to be more efficient at work. You'd never have to worry about getting chores/errands done before or after work with the possibility of a place of business being closed.  |-| 
|-| co0f6pu || 10 || Agreed with him up until the last part about CEOs not being necessary. They are very unique individuals who keep all the companies that help make the world running. Not to mention everyone that starts their own venture (which he was saying is good) will thus be the CEO if their company. I fail to see how they suddenly become less relevant because their company happens to get big.  |-|

Should we not be teaching knowledge and skills that really help you improve yourself and the world, not simple knowledge to pass exams? Don't we all agree with this on the inside? Why has nothing changed? |-|

|-| co0ar17 || -4 || He really wonders why people are working longer hours despite automation, as if those are the only two factors?  What a stupid point to raise.  And it's funny that only he is able to talk to all of these people in a way that makes them secretly reveal how useless their jobs are.  I've see a ton of corporate waste in my few years, but amazingly I can't think of a single person who had a job for long when it could be done away with.

Edit: David Graeber is a commie Jew.

&gt;Graeber's parents, who were in their forties when Graeber was born, were self-taught working-class intellectuals.[4] Graeber's mother, Ruth Rubenstein, had been a garment worker, and played the lead role in the 1930s musical comedy revue Pins &amp; Needles, staged by the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union.[4][5] Graeber's father Kenneth, who was affiliated with the Youth Communist League in college, though he quit well before the Hitler-Stalin pact, participated in the Spanish Revolution in Barcelona and fought in the Spanish Civil War.[6] He later worked as a plate stripper on offset printers.[4] Graeber grew up in New York, in a cooperative apartment building described by Business Week magazine as "suffused with radical politics."[4] Graeber has been an anarchist since the age of 16, according to an interview he gave to The Village Voice in 2005.[7]

|-| co0eznx || -7 || "Free money" doesn't exist. It would come from the members of society who weren't parasites and went to work.

In case you somehow missed the subtext here, what this guy is selling is Socialism. 

Socialism has failed. It is fundamentally flawed. There are no successful socialist countries. Economies need competition.

While it is a nice thought that you could sit on your ass all day and write poetry, it's not something we should aspire to. People should aspire to be hard working, useful members of society. It's something you can take pride in.

It's right up there on my list with people watching shitty sub 720p content on their HDTVs. Not only are they flushing money down the toilet, but they have a trophy in the middle of their living room highlighting just how much.

|-| co0h0ro || 10 || I'm glad someone else has a love for Reaper! I was a professional audio engineer for nearly 12 years and have been using it for the past 8. I would always tell my friends and colleagues about how amazing and affordable it is but for some reason everyone has a hard-on for Pro Tools.  Also, instead buying your SFX individually through that website, you may want to consider buying a sound library from Hollywood Edge or Sound Ideas. They have a lot of great general packages. |-|

One of the common things that I notice on upcoming YouTubers is when they use green screen to simulate outside conditions, even though they are recording inside their room. The audio ends up having too much reverb. It just screams mismatch.

The sound has to match the video. You can trick your eyes much more easily and sort of get away with in video production. Sound is much harder to fake.  |-|

|-| co0yz4i || 3 || This don't drink and drive video is one of my all time favorites! A real classic skateboard movie. One of the first "new school" movies. Feat. Guy Mariano and Jason Lee and Spike Jonze as director. I read somewhere they had got some money from somewhere that required them to make e a don't drink and drive segment. If you are interested in skateboarding you should watch the whole movie and know that this movie changed skating.

|-| co0ylo6 || 158 || My brother's chocolate lab does this... sort of. One day we were goofing around on the dock and while she was looking I dove deep underwater and snuck underneath the dock. There's barely enough space for breathing room so I slowly stuck my mouth out of the water so I didn't bonk my head or make noise so she would hear me.

Well, after about 10 seconds I hear her claws and whimpers on the dock above and she dives in. After a few ungraceful doggy paddles she spots me under the dock and comes toward me with wide, panicked eyes. Apparently she didn't have a rescue plan so instead of gently biting my hand to drag me out she just scratches the fucking shit out of me. I bang my head on the dock and swallow water so now we're both panicking.

I shove her away to escape her toe-knives and climb back onto the dock. I lift her out of the water and set her down next to me. Her tail is going crazy and she licks my face thinking she just saved my life. I look down to examine the bloody scratch marks all over my neck and chest, sigh, and call her a good girl.

TLDR; A sweet, yet dumb, chocolate lab almost drowns me trying to save me from drowning.

|-| co0x6mw || 31 || I was once at Ventura beach when we noticed a motionless seal about 25 yards off shore. Something seemed wrong so we swam out and realized it had been bitten by a shark. After some chasing we managed to get the poor guy to shore where we held him in his final moments. I'll never forget how he lovingly looked my brother in the eyes, leaned over, and bit him square in the leg. My brother had to take a bunch of antibiotics for a few weeks after that. Poor lil ace paid the ultimate price though. RIP Ace.

|-| co0a7b0 || 211 || This is what mourning idealism looks like.  If anything, this commentary is probably most suitably aimed at our (redditor) demographic.

Most of us are doing pretty well compared to the rest of the world, but our lives still lack any real meaning.  Few if any of us are actually driving change in the world.  Many of us are struggling with realizing the world is far too complex to encompass it all onto one mind, and this forces us to cope with out own weakness and incapability.  This lack of control leaves us feeling helpless.  All we can do is lash out at seemingly obvious injustice, and while injustice should be lashed, the way topics can be spinned obfuscates the lines between justice, injustice, benevolence and exploitation.  

We are hopelessly lost, thrashing about in the confusing smog of politics and propaganda.  Cynicism is a ladder out of the smog, but even from atop this lofty perch, all that is visible is the outside of the cloud.  All we can do is look at the smog with disdain and occasionally and tell it things we don't like, but the smog is down there, and you're up here.  Cynicism is a defensive reaction, and defense is not a proactive force of change.

Something about irony, bla bla bla, you get it.  I'm hungry now. |-|

|-| co0dux2 || 10 || Man, I don't understand the comments in this thread at all. I really liked this short film. It captured the anger and frustration I feel on many random political issues, especially when I'm constantly bombarded with people's viewpoints on those things. It makes me want to just throw up my hands and say "fuck you, and your fucking viewpoint." I don't see this frustration expressed much, and I thought this video was refreshing.

She is wrong on many points, of course. And she obviously knows she is wrong. But that doesn't invalidate the feelings. |-|

http://youtu.be/C1Irs_kORa0?t=38s |-| 
|-| co0eup0 || 7 || I thnk some of the people who are saying they don't like the film are missing the point.  It's not just a blunt critique of the breadth of intolerance in the world today.  

What the film really shows is that 21st century man is overloaded with exposure to problems that they can personally do nothing about.  It's the problem of atomization.  And I think it's an apt statement. |-| 
|-| co06md5 || 7 || She makes some valid points. |-| 
|-| co0cjm7 || 5 || tl;dr: "f-ck intolerance and f-ck you if you don't agree. "

After a moment or two, I had to keep watching to see what point the film was trying to make.  I had lots of criticism for the little things but standing back and taking a look, I would have to say it is well done.  |-| 
|-| co0a5x5 || 4 || It's amazing that she can begin her monologue because she hates that islamist fundamentalists would attack people for exercising free speech, but she goes on to hate free speech. She hates hate crimes against gay people, but also hates gay people making themselves visible through pride parades, when they should presumably sit in corners and try not to be noticed or bother anyone in response to their oppression. Primarily, it seems that she hates people who make a fuss, even though she herself is making a fuss, and she hates social media culture, despite being a character in a video meant to be spread on social media. It's hard to imagine the kind of person who wouldn't raise her ire, because believing in anything is grounds to get you attacked from her standpoint. You would have to be a MODERATE liberal who never makes their opinions or sexual identity known. It's pretty easy to not want anyone to make a fuss when your day consists of waking up to a breakfast with your child and husband, getting brunch with your girlfriends, taking a jog, eating dinner with your husband and child with a nice bottle of wine, and then a family movie night. Anyone with a slightly more challenging life (anyone) might find reason to cause commotion. Basically, fuck the film maker who thought this was a compelling idea.

I understand the point of this film is that she ever so ironically says "fuck intolerance" at the end, and I get that the filmmakers were ok with this being offensive. But I believe that the film makers were presenting real opinions of the things they think suck in the world, since this started as a "response to the incomprehensibly horrifying way 2015 has started." They believe all of these hateful things against anyone who has a belief or identity other than that of a middle-upper-class moderate liberal, and they recognize the irony of the fact that these beliefs make them intolerant. 

Well perhaps they should do more than just recognize that irony and start interrogating their frustrated opinions to understand from where their vitriolic contradictions stem. For example, "fuck vegans?" Nobody's hurting you by choosing to not eat animal products. That is all a vegan is: someone who doesn't eat animal products. And I say, if that floats their boats, good on them. Even if a vegan points out to me that I'm supporting an industry of torture, I shouldn't say, "fuck them," I should say, "you're right, but it's not one of my top priorities." The hero of this video instead says, "get YOUR priorities straight." Not only is she telling someone how to live their life (start eating meat), which she hates, but she's falling for the fallacy of relative privation. You can't care about cows getting killed because there are bigger problems, like terrorism. But there are bigger problems than terrorism, like AIDS and cancer. If you follow relative privation far enough, basically the only problem in the world anyone is allowed to care about is environmental destruction or global poverty, depending on which you think will kill more people in the long run. 

It's important to differentiate between "vegans" and "assholes who harass me for eating meat." It's important to differentiate between people who worship Islam and Islamist terrorists. It's important to differentiate between any generalized group and the actions of a few assholes (even groups in power!). If you don't, your directionless rage will lead you to hating gay people and people who hate gay people, liberal and conservative ideology, free speech and those who attack it, etc. This is a proof by contradiction: if the exploration of your theory has lead you to hate things that you cannot logically hate simultaneously, the axioms you started with were wrong.   |-|

|-| co0hugh || 77 || It is amazing how payed respect to the animal at the end a tribute from one animal to another after a long day. This is like watching early humans in action in real life. |-|

|-| co0dhtv || 18 || I've seen this video a few times but just had a thought; if the man runs 8hrs to chase the thing down in light gear alone, how is he lugging that meat back to their settlement? |-| 
|-| co0owgj || 5 || I can't decide what I like more the fact that this guy ran 8 hours with short breaks or how he honored the animal after he killed it. |-| 
|-| co07nil || 17 || Was antilope . Is cantilope. |-|

How does a cameraman keep up in an 8 hour run with this man?

also

This man just ran in a random direction behind the antelope, how does he drag it back to his party? 

 |-| 
|-| co0nwry || 5 || The Tarahumara also do the same thing. It's a coming of age thing for the males. They will chase down a beast till it just stands there. 

Compare that to the coming of age of the typical Fat American. Who probably gets a nice car and drives to Taco Bell. |-|

I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures which are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.

**I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug.**

I will not be ashamed to say "I know not," nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery.

I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God.

**I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.**

**I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.**

**I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.**

If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help."

I guess he plugged his ears through every immunology class he's ever taken, because I'm only a WEEK into mine and we've already learned that vaccines are safe.  

In 1999, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Association of Pediatricians (AAP) released a joint recommendation that vaccine manufacturers begin to gradually phase out thimerosal use in vaccines.  Thimerosal is a mercury-based additive.  This recommundation was given in order to keep children below the EPA recommended maximum for mercury exposure, **NOT BECAUSE THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF IT CAUSING AUTISM**.

In 1998, a study appeared in a British Medical Journal called *The Lancet*, which further fueled misguided parent advocacy groups and anti-vaccine organizations.  The study, published by Andrew Wakefield, claimed the critical vaccine measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) caused pervasive developmental disorders in children, such as autism.  

More than a decade later, subsequent research has been unable to substantiate the claims made in this study.  **10 of the 12 initial authors on the paper have withdrawn their support for the study.**  In 2010, *The Lancet* retracted the study after it had been shown that **the data was falsified**.  This study did enormous damage to  the population's immunity, with the MMR vaccine use decreasing from a high of 92% to 60% in some areas of the UK.

&gt; *In 2004, I met the most amazing woman who would soon become my wife. Heather is a* **chiropractor** *and has a heavy focus on nutrition and healthy, chemical free living.*

Sometime around the turn of the century, chiropractors became complete quacks. 

My ex once took me to a screening of Food Inc. hosted by her chiropractor. After the film he started going on about the benefits of raw, unpasteurized milk and how he refused to let his 5 year-old daughter drink any milk but raw milk.

My ex, who is a nurse, was completely convinced and said she was going to start drinking it. I wasn't convinced and did some research. All of the benefits the chiropractor described was all bullshit. All of it. I also saw what the risks of drinking raw milk could cause, including life-threatening and crippling effects. 

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if Jenny McCarthy was taught the lies she preaches about vaccinations causing autism from a chiropractor.

|-| co984k6 || 109 || During my career as an attorney, I've realized that doctors really aren't as smart as you'd expect. I know I'm completely generalizing an entire profession, and as someone who's in a profession that's very susceptible to being generalized, I shouldn't do that.

My area of practice is tax and white collar crime. It's amazing the percentage of my clients who are doctors doing really dumb shit. I don't see it with scientists, engineers, computer programmers, or any other profession that is typically thought of as a "smart" profession.

It seems like doctors are more susceptible than others to being extremely selfish. Although they're making more money than 99% of people out there, they seem more likely to cheat on their taxes or find other ways to rip people off (medicare fraud, fraudulent billing, tax evasion, etc.). Maybe they think they're smarter than everyone else and can get away with it? Again, I realize I'm completely generalizing, and the majority of doctors are great people. |-|

|-| co9bzlz || 21 || Here is that physicians response to all the negative reactions he has gotten: 

I recently did an interview which was aired on NBC Phoenix. I was asked my opinion on vaccinations in response to the current measles outbreaks that have occurred at Disneyland in California. My reply has generated quite a bit of anger in thousands of people.

There has also been a tremendous amount of support to my comments and opinions. In short, The Society Against Injecting Our Kids With Chemicals (TSAIOKWC for short) has a lot of followers.

I want to address all this misguided anger and see if we can re-direct it where it belongs.

Be angry at food companies. Sugar cereals, donuts, cookies, and cupcakes lead to millions of deaths per year. At its worst, chicken pox killed 100 people per year. If those chicken pox people didn’t eat cereal and donuts, they may still be alive. Call up Nabisco and Kellogg’s and complain. Protest their products. Send THEM hate-mail.

Be angry at fast food restaurants. Tortured meat burgers, pesticide fries, and hormone milkshakes are the problem. The problem is not Hepatitis B which is a virus contracted by drug users and those who sleep with prostitutes. And you want to inject that vaccine into your newborn?

Be angry at the companies who make your toxic laundry detergent, fabric softener, and dryer sheets. You and your children are wearing and breathing known carcinogens (they cause cancer). Call Bounce and Downy and let them know. These products kill more people than mumps, a virus which actually doesn’t cause anyone to die. Same with 
hepatitis A, a watery diarrhea.

Be angry at all the companies spewing pollution into our environment. These chemicals and heavy metals are known to cause autism, heart disease, cancer, autoimmune disease and every other health problem. Worldwide, these lead to 10’s of millions of deaths every year. Measles deaths are a tiny fraction compared to pollution.

Be angry at your parents for not breastfeeding you, co-sleeping with you, and stuffing your face with Domino’s so they can buy more Tide and finish the laundry. Breastfeeding protects your children from many infectious diseases.

Be angry with your doctor for being close-minded and not disclosing the ingredients in vaccines (not that they read the package insert anyway). They should tell you about the aluminum, mercury, formaldehyde, aborted fetal tissue, animal proteins, polysorbate 80, antibiotics, and other chemicals in the shots. According to the Environmental Working Group, newborns contain over 200 chemicals as detected by cord blood. Maybe your doctor feels a few more chemicals injected into your child won’t be a big deal.

Be angry with the cable companies and TV manufacturers for making you and your children fat and lazy, not wanting to exercise or play outside. Lack of exercise kills millions more than polio. Where are all those 80 year olds crippled by polio? I can’t seem to find many.
In fact, be angry with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates for creating computers so you can sit around all day blasted with electromagnetic radiation reading posts like this.

Be angry with pharmaceutical companies for allowing us to believe living the above life can be treated with drugs. Correctly prescribed drugs kill thousands of people per year. The flu kills just about no one. The vaccine never works.

Finally, be angry with yourself for not opening your eyes to the snow job and brainwashing which have taken over your mind. You NEVER asked the doctor any questions. You NEVER asked what is in the vaccines. You NEVER learned about these benign infections.

Let’s face it, you don’t really give a crap what your children eat. You don’t care about chemicals in their life. You don’t care if they sit around all day watching the TV or playing video games.

All you care about is drinking your Starbuck’s, your next plastic surgery, your next cocktail, your next affair, and your next sugar fix!

This post was created with love and with the idea of creating a better world for our children and future generations. Anger increases your risk of suffering a heart attack. Be careful.

|-| co9brez || 7 || What a piece of shit. He should have his medical license revoked. I hope people troll the shit out of this guy. |-| 
|-| co99vk6 || 10 || I don't get how this isn't illegal.

If I drive my car recklessly and kill someones kids, it's my fault. If I refuse to vaccinate a treatable disease and spread it, killing a few children, then somehow that's my choice and no one can make me do it.

Really? That's being reckless and endangering people for no good reason. They should be held accountable for their actions. |-|

It's called social responsibility, you fucking **DOCTOR!!!** |-| 
|-| co95dtc || 3 || He should be forced to home school them and keep them in isolation the rest of the time.  |-| 
|-| co99tm3 || 3 || Yeah, fuck that "doctor". Hope his kids don't have to suffer from his medical/scientific incompetence.  |-| 
|-| co99ucl || 3 || this is bulshit. that's okey if your child doesn't affect to my child but it does.. this is not liberty.  |-|

lol, this guy can't be real |-| 
|-| co99nqj || 7 || I almost... really really almost, wish his children died of measles or some other vaccinatable disease since "people just die"

only reason I don't is because those poor children don't have a choice thanks to their retarded as fuck father |-|

Display some self-control.  |-| 
|-| co9byml || 4 || What a piss poor excuse for a doctor.  |-| 
|-| co9aqpl || 6 || This circlejerk is invading every area of my feed. To all future posters of anti-antivaccine (in ANY subreddit), we get it, we agree with you, but enough is enough.  |-| 
|-| co99xlq || 3 || If the selfish ignorance of a single family results in the death of mine. Best believe i will come after your lives with every intention to torture and kill you. This makes absolutely no sense at all. Some people are just plain retarded and shouldn't be allowed to reproduce and spread their idiocy. |-| 
|-| co9ckr2 || 3 || This is rage inducing. I can't even deal with it. Apparently, his chiropractor wife is responsible for his new found stupidity. He needs to lose his medical license. |-|

|-| co9alw7 || 3 || Isn't that doctor in violation of the hippocratic oath and should be stripped of his MD status? |-| 
|-| co9bpj9 || 3 || Doctor: "I got the most people sick, making me the victor."

Medical School: "We must apologize for this doctor. He is an idiot. We have purposely trained him wrong. As a joke." |-| 
|-| co9brnv || 3 || This guy needs his license revoked, just like the idiot who published the first anti-vaccine paper. |-| 
|-| co9c8fl || 3 || One of these days, I fear that a parent who loses a child due to the failure of another parent to have their children vaccinated will seek deadly vengeance. |-| 
|-| co93h50 || 3 || How...what...What in the FUCK kind of medical evidence does Dr. GlutenFreePurePeople Adolf Hitler has for his claim that its toxic? Like....Small pox...killed millions...vaccine shows up and its nearly erradicated. So...clearly its toxic. What? Seriously some people man. |-| 
|-| co97vpe || 3 || "i'm not going to sacrifice the well being of my child"

just sacrifice your child. you know. for god.  |-| 
|-| co998ne || 3 || I'm not sure i'm understanding this correctly. What would the parents of vaccinated kids have to be afraid of from unvaccinated kids? Wouldn't the vaccinated kids be protected from the illness that the unvaccinated kids would be vulnerable to.  |-|

|-| co9heeb || 9 || The thing that surprised me the most about this was the fact that it would take nearly as much time to get to Saturn from Jupiter, as it did to get to Jupiter from the Sun.  I never visualized the expanse between the two bodies. |-|

 |-| 
|-| co9fp8p || 6 || If we did travel that fast from the sun to Jupiter, would 43 minutes *really* pass? Or would it just be an instant, because time doesn't move at light speed.  |-| 
|-| co972mq || 248 || Calling this "real time" is a bit misleading as the video is shown in the rest frame of the light. From this perspective *no* time elapses due to time dilation, and the distance between objects should be zero.

So really, this is a classical picture which doesn't map to "real time" at all. |-|

|-| co9fxr0 || 3 || This video was fascinating but terribly depressing to me. There are so many stars out there in the universe, yet when you put it into this context, it seems we are doomed to stay rather close to home.

|-| co9hwiv || 161 || This is so great especially if you watch from the beginning. Over that 8 minutes you really get to develop a dislike for them, and a hate for the bald dude in the white Sherman jersey, after hear and seeing 8 minutes of screaming at a tv, high fives, and jumping up and down at seemingly every catch like they just won the game. |-| 
|-| co9ke9t || 33 || The craziness was really the insanity of the Kearse catch and then the pick. That high right to that low was the largest swing in my sports history. Time to let Schneider go to work, combine in 3 weeks! |-|

|-| co9msfi || 53 || I always brushed off the Seahawks as a "new" rival as a Niner fan. Never hated them as much as the Cowboys.

Then the fanbase started chirping and hollering and buying billboards and trying to buy bricks at our new stadium, etc.

Never in my life do I remember seeing any Seahawks fans, now I see jerseys everywhere. Get a new coach, new QB, and some snazzy new uniforms and you got yourself a bandwagon.

I talk a LOT of shit about my 49er fanbase, I think our fanbase can be downright awful sometimes, but at least when you attend a game or party here you'll see jerseys of ANYBODY. Linemen, punters, special teams, etc. You look in a Seahawks group you only see about 5 star players jerseys. |-| 
|-| co9mfut || 35 || I am a Bears fan but I've always pulled for the Seahawks as the underdog team from a traditionally less successful area - a fresh change from the big market teams that always seem to win.  

That is until this last weekend.  I was in Las Vegas and I've never seen such a group of douchebags as the seahawks fans.  Loud. Obnoxious. Rude.  After a few days of it I decided to go for the Pats so I'm glad of the outcome.  This video shows the typical fan I saw.  They remind me of most Raiders fans I've ever met - zero class and cannot recognize that being a fan doesn't entitle you to be an asshole in the name of your team. |-|

**Schadenfreude** |-| 
|-| co9cvq3 || 88 || God that was satisfying. As a long suffering eagles supporter, watching these band-wagon hopping seattle frauds just made my day. You got one last year, enjoy it, cause believe me, you don't know how long it's gonna be until you get to taste that success again.  |-|

|-| co9sp7w || 4 || Beast mode? It sounds like they're just REALLY into an episode of Transformers: Beast Wars and Optimus Prime is about to transform into a gorilla and rip Scorponok's fucking stinger off. Waspinator is just flying around doing jack shit. And then fucking Dinobot (after he defects and becomes a good guy) crashes through the ceiling with his whirling shield and knocks the shit out of Megatron's head. But then Megatron turns into a T-rex and rips Dinobot's spark out and he's dead forever. |-| 
|-| co9ggc6 || 39 || To be fair to Seahawks fans, they absolutely should have won that game. You give that ball to Lynch on the 1 yard line, 90% chance you win the game. It was a ridiculously stupid play to make, so if I was a fan i'd be pretty pissed off too.  |-| 
|-| co9j9bo || 23 || A group of heavily inebriated bandwagon fans knew to give the ball to Lynch on the 1 and Pete Carroll didn't. Just let that sink in. |-| 
|-| co9lsjj || 4 || This video brought me a lot of happiness. Thank you for posting! |-| 
|-| co9mits || 6 || People seem to be blowing the seahawks bandwagon out of proportion. I'm a Bears fan but I see no more bandwagoning then what goes on every year. Bandwagoners are usually the same people. They float from team to team depending on if they're good and have a good chance to win because they are not real sports fans and like to bask in the glory of victory without paying your dues by sucking all the other times. If Broncos won super bowl last year and were looking to repeat you'd see same exact thing. This goes for all sports too. Its magical how many Miami jerseys have turned in to Cleveland jerseys this year.  |-|

|-| co9p1ec || 3 || Am I the only one that spent the entire video watching the lady on right. Who clearly has no fucking idea what's going on. And is really trying hard to pretend she does. She even goes for a high 5 at one point and and is hanging for a good 4 seconds and then tries to swiftly turn it into a... I don't know what she turned it into, but it didn't work.

Why are these people so wrapped up in the outcome of a game in which they are not directly involved? It makes no sense to me. Why is the guy yelling at the TV about a play call?  |-|

people seem to devise on it by taking the two extreme positions 

1. Sexism is never a problem in games 
2. Sexism is the biggest problem ever and everything is awful 

can we just have the middle ground and work to make games as good as they can be  |-| 
|-| co95iyi || 92 || Called her out in a calm, adult manner, with no cursing or pewdiepie mannerisms. Nice, informative video. |-| 
|-| co9dgfm || 99 || I'm a female gamer and I would be devastated if idiots like this were able to have an impact on the gaming industry. If I wanted to play boring, politically correct video games then that's what I would buy.

But if I want to dildo slap abortions in South Park, go furry hunting in a leather gimp suit in Saints Row or fuck alien consorts in Mass Effect then I LOVE that it's my choice to do so. If you don't like it, don't play it, don't pay attention to it and keep YOUR kids away from it. But please don't try to ruin everyone's fun by enforcing your own opinions and standards upon us. 

Gaming is meant to be an escape where you can enjoy and do unreasonable or reasonable things and we all know that there's no link between our actions in games and our actions in the world. Just like everywhere else it is still just individuals making choices and that's the way it should be. |-| 
|-| co94lgv || 58 || Honestly I could give a shit about her message at this point, You cant laud moral authority than just shy of steal and not follow through with your commitments.

|-| co9aw01 || 29 || I consider myself a feminist. It's really embarrassing to have somebody like this associated with the movement. How can you complain about misrepresentation of women when you misrepresent yourself? Media should not be censored for not fitting into an agenda. There are women's issues more important than Chun-Li, like abortion access or sex trafficking.  My bf is a gamer, and while there are fewer female character options, I haven't seen anything too disturbing. Realistically, bodily diversity has no place in Call of Duty. |-|

Is this still a thing? Girls unhappy with their appearance/objectivity in video games? 

This was a thing back in 1995, big breasted girls, bursting out of the games, game ads, so on. the goal was to hook the 13yr boy who had raging hormones, and it worked, but judging from the games I see now, this isn't happening as much, if at all.

This seems like an attention whore/money making scheme to me.  |-| 
|-| co96rl7 || 25 || That pic of her with all those games and the simple evidence that she didn't play them is great. That pic is honestly what made me notice her in the first place.

That photo is the definition of : " Us gamers, huh, we sure are something ".  |-| 
|-| co9dm84 || 16 || Video games don't objectify women anymore than they objectify anything and everything.

|-| co96a44 || 81 || Say what you want about this woman's criticism of gaming culture, but as a guy who has played every console since I had a Texas Instruments, gaming culture is cringe as fuck and needs to be called out on a lot of the juvenile, racist, sexist bullshit that one encounters in video games, both the content and the culture surrounding it.

|-| co9n6ng || 4 || i'm a girl, i grew up playing video games. ive always played videogames. i started on sega genesis, went to supernintendo (out of order i know...) n64, xbox, ps1, ps2, ps3, xbox 360, and always had a high spec computer. Played shooters, rts, stuff like spore and runescape and WoW, guildwars... a lot. 

that all being said, all this shit is silly and seriously doesn't help her case. How sad it is that this group wants to show how sexualized and victimized women are in the games, and then wants to show how victimized she is in life.... like in the sense that she's whining and pLaying some princess peach shit. listen, us girls KNOW women are sexualized.... but honestly, at least for me, i dont give a fuck. please PLEASE PLEASE do NOT start making BULLSHIT games to just be so PC. i'd MUCH rather have people beating up strippers while maintaining the integrity of GTA than some watered down bullshit where devs can't have creative freedom.
listen, the threats, sexual advances, "i bet you're ugly in real life. send me a FB invite to prove it" shit is just a bunch of bullshit. fuck those guys, i come to play video games not get all butthurt because some asswhipe of a kid wants to troll and make me feel like im in the 1950s. im not. To me, growing up i thought women played videogames because i played videogames and had a good chunk of girls that played too... not my little pony shit either, but like a girl who won a Halo competition against 20 other dudes, a girl who always ranked top three in every search and destroy match online, a girl that always kicked ass raiding in Wow, these were the girls i worked with and we never sat and had a fucking pity party about the sexism in the industry. id take sexism any day to have a good game than a bunch of PC bullshit to appease a bunch of people that are not happy. that being said, id love some more female characters i could play, and being completely naked as a army ranger is a fucking stupid idea.... but better than some hello kitty bullshit.  UGH Sorry for the rant, but to me being a female gamer isnt anything fucking special. all it means is i'm a female, and i like to play videogames. leave me the fuck alone about being a girl unless you wanna instance together on guildwars 2, because that's my shit right now. :) 

TL;DR i support a better/equal representation and ability to play more female roles, but not at the cost of creative content. Additionally Sarkeesian never shows (or maybe doesnt even know about) strong female roles like Samus, Elena fisher, Jill valentine, Commander shepard, and others.  |-| 
|-| co92fe1 || 15 || Great video, but unfortunately the storm has passed. She's already been legitimized by the industry and the media. What really gets me is Colbert had her on his show, months after Suey Park did the whole "Cancel Colbert" thing. Different issue, sure, but it's the same kind of person at the heart: a professional victim. |-| 
|-| co95rme || 17 || Too bad this generation can't get this behind complaining about government corruption or injustice that displaces families and costs lives or helping the environment. Somehow it's all about some woman and her video game critique series where every critique ends up amounting to 'this could happen if you do this' and 'maybe we could write this a little better instead of relying on cliche tropes'.

Kills me. |-| 
|-| co97nn1 || 8 || I really really wish that there will come a situation where she is in public, where she can't run and some really serious journalist has the possibility to put her on the spot. There is so much factually wrong in her videos and it is so balantely  obvious that she never researched shit. 

Anyone remember the Colbert part where she was in? She was so close to be put on that spot, but Colbert failed me so hard in this segment.I lost much respect for the man that night. |-|

Is there fanservice in the game? YES, there is a metric fuck-ton of it! But that is completely irrelvant - the gameplay is immaculate for the genre, the story is great (many argue it's the weak point, but SOMETHING has to be the weakpoint in anything), the music is fucking spectacular (still listen to it to this day), the sound effects are on point, and the package overall is just superb.

thanks for the video and share. |-| 
|-| co9enoe || 4 || Just an aside but I wouldn't put it past the internet to give a video a 1:33 like to dislike ratio.  |-| 
|-| co9j0ui || 3 || Why do people think some industry is so bad off that it needs them to swoop in to be a censor? Art is supposed to explore imaginative and fantastic areas, but not those areas over there! That's off limits! |-| 
|-| co9atcr || 4 || Slaughter animals in any game, meh its not like its real.

Step on dead bodies/ kill people with no remorse from the character in the game, meh its not like its real.

support terrorism in a game, meh its not like its real.

Make a girls boobs jiggle, OMG SEXISM THATS SO WRONG WHY CANT YOU MAKE THE GAME EVEN FOR ALL GENDERS, WHY DID YOU MAKE COCKS FLAP AROUND THATS GROSS AND OFFENSIVE TO WOMEN WHO DONT HAVE DICKS THATS NOT FAIR, YOU CANT DO THAT


She gets her money off of trolling you so you click the videos and give views, just ignore the trolls. |-| 
|-| co96ytq || 5 || This is what I don't understand about gamergate:

Aren't tropes created by Television and movies?  Why when those same tropes are used in video games it's an issue? And also, how come the ones that actually make the effort to break down those tropes or cliches tend to be completely ignored?  |-| 
|-| co96vxq || 6 || My bad. As a non-gamer, I was hoping to get some objective information. This came off as a guy cornering me at a party, and backing up all his claims with *"Trust me dude... it's bad"*

This response is the YouTube equivalent of the debate tactic known as "Nuh-uh!" |-| 
|-| co97hz9 || 6 || Okay I guess I will be the voice of dissent here.  I like Anita Sarkisian's  (I'm probably spelling that wrong) content, and I say this as someone who loves a lot of the games she criticizes.  I do think there is a certain role that female characters play in video games and it is usually a male fantasy. Does that necessarily make it a bad character, no. Bayonetta is totally fetishized but she's also a fun character.  Then you have women in the background of games, like strippers in GTA 5 that serve no purpose besides lapdances and getting gunned down.  I think Anita Sarkisian has some good points, I don't agree with all of them but I don't write her off as a huckster either.  

The guy who made this video does make some good points, there should be transparency as to what this kickstarter is doing.  And she should give credit to those who make the let's play videos.  I agree with both those statements. But also having seen plenty of Anita's content including "Tropes vs Women" I see all that shit in games.  And none of the attacks made on Anita are against her arguments, they are only against her.  He doesn't even mention the arguments she makes, which are compelling and do hold up to evidence. This is what bothers me about people who attack Anita, they attack her and not her arguments.  They compare her to Nancy Grace and say she is a huckster but don't give a counter example.  If I am to take gamer gate seriously it should be a constructive debate and not flinging shit at each other. Until then I don't want any part of pro or anti gg.

Edit: okay, I tried opening a rational dialog and I got downvoted.  Maybe the media is right about gg's fanaticism and knee jerk reactions to criticism.  I'm through wasting my time on this issue, I got shit to do  |-| 
|-| co97xfj || 3 || She'll finish in 2020 at the rate she is going, probably later... It took less time for Germany to invade most of western europe and eastern, and then for those regions to be liberated than it will for her to read wikipedia summaries and steal content. |-| 
|-| co9etvj || 4 || Wait... are those *her* tweets?! |-| 
|-| co9d44x || 4 || Gawker will now make a click-bait article about this x-posting it on jezebel, stop bullying!  |-| 
|-| co9g0p0 || 3 || As soon as I heard that Sunny music I knew it was going to be a good video. |-| 
|-| co9gc51 || 3 || So the kickstarter for her was to give her money to buy games? why would anyone do this... |-| 
|-| co9gjzc || 3 || wait so the mods aren't closing this........ or are those clowns that tried to censor previous threads demodded.  |-| 
|-| co8z244 || -17 || I don't blame the guy for asking for a refund if he wants one. It can't hurt to ask. But the nature of kickstarter is that there's always the chance that the creators either won't deliver or that you won't be satisfied with the final product.

Most of the rest of this video is just annoying whining though. In the video where Anita discusses Hitman, she explicitly stated that there are penalties in the game for killing people. Of course, he doesn't acknowledge that in this video. So he's going to accuse her of not doing her research and cherry picking even though he's doing exactly that himself like a hypocrite.

And then he claims that it's "impossible" that the reason the ABC News video had tons of downvotes is because she's a woman talking about gaming. As if mob mentality was never a thing on the internet. Downvote mobs happen on reddit and they happen on youtube. First of all, I don't think Anita has ever claimed that everyone agrees with her about her that sexism in gaming is a problem. I think it's clear to all that plenty of people disagree with her, so I'm not sure what point he's even trying to make. But if he's claiming that the fact that she has a lot of dislikes on youtube is proof that she's wrong, that's just silly. |-| 
|-| co9cs33 || 3 || Sadly this video is part of the problem. Paying attention to hateful ignorant attention whores only feeds them. Erase that succubus' name from your memory and move on with your life.

#Pcgamingmasterrace |-| 
|-| co967l1 || -7 || Jesus, this bullshit is still going on?  
Then again, with clear evidence and logical reasoning to back up his arguments like, "You know that isn't true, I know that isn't true," this guy sure proves his points.  
He starts off defining Feminist Frequency as, "a video series that superficially analyzes female characters in gaming by shoehorning them into predefined tv tropes...while spouting pseudo-science in an attempt to convince you that video games contribute to sexism in society today."  
Not a single thing in the rest of the video backs that up in any way whatsoever.  He just whines about the videos taking too long to come out and how Anita only responds to white males (wtf?), and apparently disabling Youtube comments is some form of censorship, because those comments would have been filled with enlightened, civil discussion.  
Gamergate's supposedly all about 'ethics in journalism' but somehow all they ever do is put out videos bashing a very few select feminist women.  Where are all the gamergate videos and articles analyzing how advertising is affecting gaming review scores? |-| 
|-| co92kgt || -11 || Isn't this old news already? I was honestly happy the whole gamergate ordeal was finally over, it was one of the most pointless and idiotic things i've ever heard of. Every point that can ever be made about this so called "issue" has already been made. Let's just stop. |-| 
|-| co91c4l || -7 || I seriously haven't made it through 45 seconds of Sarkeesian speaking. 

My blood pressure just skyrockets and I start swearing uncontrollably, the woman is beyond irritating and is a stereotypical feminazi, that's all she really is honestly. She has a warped view of what SHE thinks gender roles should be yet seems oblivious to hundreds of millions of years of evolution.

 |-| 
|-| co9euai || 3 || Fuck this SJW leech.  |-| 
|-| co946tm || -4 || Followers of people like Anita Sarkeesian remind me of "the allegory of the cave". Brainwashed "college kids" who dont really know anything about the real world outside of there womens studies textbooks..  This is only the tip of the iceburg people. But damn is it sure pleasing to see someone ALWAYS comes out with the truth.  |-| 
|-| co91f73 || -4 || I really think things should be pushed beyond the idea of a refund, but more for  actually having her prosecuted for fraud and having her power stripped from her so she can stop influencing society for personal gain.

Literally, the fact that she's a female, using feminism to profit and push an agenda she probably doesn't even care about, is a massive detriment to the cause of feminism, as it just makes women seem less trustworthy because this champion of the cause (who is not an outlier, but supported by many) is literally exploiting those she otherwise represents. |-| 
|-| co935mh || -16 || fuck any shit relating to gamer gate. stay in your waring subs where you belong. No one fucking cares about your war |-| 
|-| co93l0s || -8 || This was one of those few times that I thought I'd better look at the comments *before* I watch the video, and I am so glad I did.

Just because you are critiquing something does not mean you want censorship. As much as I usually like to stay away from this topic, even I know that: 

* A, Sarkeesian doesn't want censorship and isn't trying to implement it, 
* B, even if she did want to, she doesn't have the fucking power to.

Now all this crying about how bad she is for linking social criticism to a medium she likes is absurd. It happens in all genres (movies, tv, magazines) and no one is trying to take away your precious past-time. 


What's the problem with her critiquing games? Who gives a shit?

It lead me down a brick road (a yellow one if you will) of SNL digital shorts. From there stopped off at the gum drop forest listening to Katy Perry remixes and dubs, then it was off to some random retro chillstep to mellow me out while I finished up the half gram purple train wreck stinger. 

I stopped off at college humor for a bit. Watched some Pete Holmes, fed cat, nuked some rolls, cracked a monster... Put spider out of misery from wife's screams. 

Blazed up another stinger (cinex), poured some chili on the pizza rolls (wise choice), and now I'm here. Sup?

We started to try and live capture them and release but for the most part it was fruitless. I hit my limit when one ran across my hand while at my PC. 

So I set up a trap under the sink, where it smelt of mouse the most (little hole in the back corner leading into the cupboard). So I armed the trap, took 2 steps and SNAP. I go back to find a dead mouse. I throw it in the bin and set up another. Another 2 steps and bang. This went on for days, I asked the neighbors and they were having similar experiences. It became apparent that our efforts were being wasted when one night we were driving down our street and I was wondering why the road was moving. I  could hear little bangs and what sounded like water under the car. I stopped and turned on the high beams to see a sea of mice running in front of us and around us. 

In the morning the road looked like someone had poured blood down it and the gutters (curb)

Within a month I guess their food source had ran out, we finished trapping (killing) the mice left in the house and did the most in depth clean of a house I have ever done (even got people in to do in the ceiling). |-|

|-| co8zic8 || 31 || OH CUZ IT'S A DONKEY! |-| 
|-| co8tz49 || 98 || This is hilarious lol. Some of them even look offended that the guy actually WASN'T talking about them.  |-| 
|-| co8zk0q || 11 || Some of these girls looked so happy after he complimented their ass.

"Yay, someone complimented my ass... OH, ***COME ON, REALLY***!" |-|

|-| co9bvsv || 3 || This is how pranks should be, not punching somebody in the face then shouting "bro its a prank" when they pull a knife. |-| 
|-| co8s3pk || 3 || The ladies that didn't bother to look behind them, still pissed off. |-| 
|-| co8v3i7 || -5 || I wish the guys pulling this prank were slightly wittier. The whole "tapping" part doesn't really work on both levels like "touching" or the compliments.

|-| co914km || 36 || WHAT THE HELL!?

He's dead? Man.

Some googling says he had a severe allergic reaction, and went into a coma.

This is pretty awful news. |-| 
|-| co9267h || 30 || ... well Crunchyroll is reporting it

http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2015/02/02/rwby-creator-monty-oum-passes-away

Rooster Teeth says it themselves...

http://roosterteeth.com/members/journal/entry.php?id=3302319 |-| 
|-| co92bcx || 42 || Here's a short announcement from [The Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmsAH20mO10) |-| 
|-| co96zyf || 24 || Dead fantasy... |-| 
|-| co9dyl4 || 8 || The saddest part to me is how well his life was going. You never know whats really going on with somebody but it looked like the guy was living his dream, RWBY just signed a deal with Warner brothers Japan.Its a reminder to me that even with perfect planning, impeccable talent, and years of commitment things don't always work out. Monty was and always will be an inspiration to creators all over the world, Rest in peace. |-| 
|-| co94xa2 || 13 || Damn! I guess that means no more RWBY?

RIP Monty, you amazingly talented bastard... |-| 
|-| co95iqa || 5 || Saw Haloid when he first released it all those years ago! I was a big fan of Monty's work ever since. Really sad to hear of his passing, but take comfort in the fact that he left behind a lot of great work in his craft. My heart goes out to his friends and family. Rooster Teeth requested that in lieu of flowers, that his fans do something creative in their own lives to honor his memory. I'll be working on a passion project today to do just that. |-| 
|-| co9bnp4 || 6 || I've been a fan of Rooster Teeth for about seven or eight years now. I respect everything Monty has done and wish that his short life wasn't ended so early. At least he left behind amazing work like this, but no one will ever replace him. |-| 
|-| co983lg || 8 || He died from an allergic reaction during a simple medical procedure. I know it's rare, but aren't there ways for doctors to check beforehand? |-| 
|-| co960xv || 3 || Oh shit, i heard he was in hospital the other day, and thought nothing much of it. Very sad news, really went off RVB and RoosterTeeth, but his animation was so cool and was a real breath of fresh air.  |-| 
|-| co9e3lf || 3 || Wow I read his bio. He is an example of "follow your passion". According to Wikipedia, he dropped out of high school and worked on all his amazing animations. Later he was hired by all these big named companies. Not everyone can do that. This is a serious loss to the world. |-| 
|-| co96jls || 3 || He will live forever through the amazing content he has created.          
             
A single person achieved many years ago what groups of people today can't replicate. He was a genius and I loved every single one of his videos. R.I.P Monty |-| 
|-| co94mhd || 10 || R.I.P Monty! Thank god I had the joy of knowing your existence  |-| 
|-| co9gc6x || -20 || [deleted] |-|

|-| co999cv || 189 || Reminds of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWLIfYB41AU) and why you don't build your restaurant over the ocean. |-| 
|-| co99uid || 35 || The explosion was ~3.8 km (~2.4 miles) away. That's a big fucking shockwave. |-| 
|-| co96xs2 || 54 || thanks I'll bear that in mind next time I'm viewing a massive explosion. |-| 
|-| co99m1u || 129 || Video is horizontal. There are no swearing or screaming women. Camera is reasonably stable. Cameraman immediately recovers to film the carnage after the window breaks.

|-| co9gcaf || 5 || uhm so are we all going to talk about the glass and not mention the giant explosion near a residential area!? Maybe I just don't know how Russia works, but that looks like a big, costly, and dangerous mistake that could have ended worse (maybe it did end even worse than showed, but there is no context and no one is asking) |-|

|-| co97xfr || 25 || [Here's](http://youtu.be/ad4cjR9Zg60) some more of Mitchell Brunings if anyone enjoyed him as much as I did.  |-| 
|-| co9eidu || 35 || This would be a better video if it didn't pan to the judges for half the song while they compete with each other on who can sap up more attention.  We get it, you're surprised someone can sing like Bob Marley.   |-| 
|-| co9cul2 || 11 || With the way Bob had kids he could be one of his bastards 

For those who don't know Bob had 17 kids with 11 women that we know  |-| 
|-| co9g9i7 || 10 || I cringed at the judges reactions  |-| 
|-| co9d983 || 13 || So what is the point of this show exactly? They don't look at him, until they do? 

 |-| 
|-| co956mu || 11 || That was very good! That really took me back. . . |-| 
|-| co9l2u5 || 4 || If I said I didn't like it, I'd be Lion. |-| 
|-| co9esoa || 8 || As someone who grew up on Bob Marley's music i can tell you this guy captured the spirit and soul of reggae music through that 2minute cover. **Beautiful** |-| 
|-| co9amb5 || 6 || Gah damn you weren't kidding |-| 
|-| co96u4s || 29 || its pretty awesome, but i dont understand shows like this. "artists" just singing songs that have been done so many times, every which way, nothing original. Shows like this, just create more and more of the same songs that you everyday, the same stuff, not that im saying its bad, but the more people that watch these shows are perpetuating more of the same shit. |-| 
|-| co9jfmq || 4 || This guy is good and he sound a lot like Bob Marley.  Marley had something that this singer does not have yet, however, and that is restraint.  Not that it is uncommon, but quite the opposite.  Restraint is a learned skill that many professionals learn after some training and development.  Amateur or "new" singers think every note and line needs to be sung as if it is the only line being sung at that very moment for the entire universe to hear.  Restraint tells us *when* to flourish so that it is meaningful next to all the other sung lines. |-|

|-| co9al9d || -6 || I like Bob Marley but his voice isn't hard to imitate if you're Jamaican... |-| 
|-| co9f39h || -3 || People really miss the point of artists.  It's not as if Bob Marley had the best voice.  It's nice and all, but it's his lyrics that are what made him famous.  This guy is just imitating his voice.  Nothing special about that.  Comedians do it all the time. |-|

|-| cob4cmw || 12 || That's really nicely edited and informative. I have never even thought about how "green screens" were done on film, I just assumed they projected a video onto a background and stood in front of it (I think they probably did), but now I know how.

I love knowing how films are made and edited. I could watch hours of VFX breakdowns, I just wish studios went into more details about the steps in the VFX process rather than showing a video of how things are composited. |-|

|-| cob7et8 || 7 || Is that a young Alan Rickman? |-| 
|-| cob5rdx || 4 || Man... this makes me pine for the days in the AV studio at my high school. We had a horribly old system that worked close to how he described the TV matte system... except for they were probably way easier for the end user than the original systems he is referencing- since again I could use it as a high school student.

It was so frustrating to work with but now looking back I'm really glad I had the chance to, since now it is so much easier now. I just remember in the middle of the show(morning announcements in home room) having the subjects face get all splotchy because someone moved a light and we hadn't set it up right. Then having the teacher start either laughing at us or yelling depending on his mood. 

Wish I still had any of those tapes... damn I'm starting to feel old. |-|

So, every time he was out without his car or sleeping soundly we would move his car, to the exact same spot but facing the other direction. We did this for weeks and he never said a word but we would always watched and he was always so damn confused every time he saw his car. It was probably one of our greatest and most subtle practical joke ever. |-|

|-| coblc7o || 17 || I can tell you when and where this situation didn't work out so well.  No grate on the upstream side and a good one on the downstream.  Had a big gully washer and kids were swimming in the flash pond, one got pulled in, didn't make it. |-|

|-| coboom1 || 7 || Hahaha! I have no idea how close I just came to dying! Hahahaha! |-| 
|-| cobrzrm || 8 || I am reminded of a sad story.


I had a kid move in across the street from me when I was 14 or so. I went over with my friend who knew him already and we hung out with him and his dad and they gave us Hawaiian Punch and Chex Mix while we chatted. The dad had just had a divorce and his son had chosen to live with him. I really liked them both immediately. 


Two days later my friend told me that the new kid's dad had died the day after we hung out with them. He was walking his dog with his son along a canal and the dog fell in the water next to a portion where the canal funneled into a pipe underground. His dad tried to pull the dog out but fell in as well and they both got sucked into the aqueduct. 


They didn't find the bodies until they came out the other side a couple days later. My new friend moved back with his mom and I never saw him again. |-| 
|-| cobq1tv || 6 || That guy's quite a bit larger than the kid, he's lucky he didn't get stuck... |-| 
|-| cobq2pm || 6 || If there was a grate in there, they'd be fish food. |-| 
|-| cobqdwq || 5 || I like this version better, where we see that they survived. |-| 
|-| cobrmvq || 5 || Fuck! That is super extremely scary. Typically they have a grille that stop rocks and shit from getting through. Imagine what would have happened if that were there in this case. You would be stuck on the grille until the water stopped flowing.

The kid laughing almost fucking died a very horrible death. |-|

|-| cobjy4t || 4 || Holy mackerel. |-| 
|-| cobomli || 4 || Wish I had a video of this, but alas none exists. Visualise this as a related topic. A recent flash flood pushed trees into an under road drain. Access from above was impossible, so a crazy volunteer was placed into the roaring flood waters, tied to a truck whilst carrying a chainsaw, and floated to the tree. There he had to stand on the tree he had to cut up, so it would pass through the drain to clear it, whilst hoping his mates would be able to drag him back against the surge when the drain began to flow.

Yes, he lived.

No, I have no idea how, and judging by his attitude to life, I doubt he will be with us much longer. |-| 
|-| cobq0qp || 4 || Finally and ending to the terrifying gif! |-| 
|-| cobr1sz || 4 || That guy looks like he saw something life changing while going through that. |-| 
|-| cobrpdq || 4 || Having seen the gif of them disappearing yesterday, I am SO FUCKING GLAD I have seen this. Phew! |-| 
|-| cobry3y || 4 || For some reason, this reminds me of a scary moment from my childhood. As a kid, my parents were out one night and I had a friend over. I convinced him to fold me up into the couch bed we had in the family room. He managed to fold me up in it, but couldn't get it to close all the way.  He then had a very difficult time unfolding it to let me out. He had to run into my uncle's room (my mother's brother was living with us at the time), to get him to help 'unfold' me from the bed.
To this day,  I firmly believe I would have suffocated to death if my buddy had been able to fully compact that sofa bed with me inside, and then not be able to get me out.

|-| cobry6r || 7 || "I'm getting too old for this..." I also like how the women are standing around laughing and taking pictures instead of, you know, actually offering to help? Good old gender roles...

Edit: 5$ says the kid wanted to go again lol |-| 
|-| cobtgsc || 6 || This happened to me as when I was about 12. I was at my friends house during a flood and we were having some fun riding our bikes through the 6 inch deep water. To help give you an idea, he had a stone driveway with wooden edges and a storm drain running underneath it about 12 or so feet long. The drain connected a small pond to a larger pond. Once we were bored with bikes we decided to break out the remote control boats. After about 10 minutes one boat runs out of battery and I go to reach for it over the side of the driveway. Turns out when wood gets wet it becomes slippery as hell and as I reached for the boat I slipped into the water. I was immediately sucked to the storm drain and my body was suctioned against it with my head still above water. Then out of nowhere Whoosh! I was ripped under and slammed my head repeatedly on the ridges of the tube. Kind of like running your hand along a metal fence, but with my head. I knew when I made it to the other side because my head and back had stopped slamming into the pipe. I surfaced by literally following the light but was trapped in my tee-shirt. I frantically searched for the hole to stick my head through, found it, and grabbed onto the stone wall on the side of the pond just in time. If I was probably 2 seconds later I would have been sucked too far into the pond and probably panicked. Luckily my friend ran over and pulled me out. I haven't spoken to him in years, maybe I should hit him up for saving my life and all.

TL/DR: I got sucked into a storm drain as a kid, I am now eternally afraid of any water I can't see through. Fuck oceans. Fuck Lakes. Fuck ponds. |-|

the guy taking the pictures is stansbury. i guess the off duty black cop must have been a liar or something. either that or when a black cop is off duty he just becomes a black guy, in the eyes of suspicion.

He may just be misstating it.  It is often a crime to be "interfering with the duties of a police officer".  If he had a warrant or other legal right to take a picture of her client, to obstruct him would be a violation of that law.

I can say that if a cop had a warrant to search a client, or a reason to stop-and-frisk (Terry stop, doesn't require a warrant) a lawyer could indeed be arrested for interfering.  Could also be disbarred.

However, it's potentially a minefield for the officer.  Lawyer-client relationship has privileges.  If there's reason to believe they're trying to prevent her client from utilizing her, oh yeah that's bad for the officer and his department. |-|

|-| cobrn2n || 3 || TL DR 148! 148! Arrest these officers!


Now bear with me a second while we establish some facts.

1)  Jami Tillotson is a public defender.

2)  The gentlemen in question were her clients, fresh from a court case and thus no matter how you slice it (as a public defender who hadn't left her clients yet) the responsibility of Jami Tillotson.

3) According to the following:

Cal Gov Code § 82048 
(a) "Public official" means every member, officer, employee or consultant of a state or local government agency.

Therefore Jami is officially a public official.

4)  The officers called for a 148. Looking up 148 in the California penal code, we find:

148 Every person who willfully resists, delays, or
obstructs any public officer, peace officer, or an emergency medical
technician, as defined in Division 2.5 (commencing with Section 1797)
of the Health and Safety Code, in the discharge or attempt to
discharge any duty of his or her office or employment, when no other
punishment is prescribed


Which leaves us with the interesting logical conclusion that the officers commit a 148, break up a lawyer and her clients, then attempt to use THAT SAME 148 to arrest the lawyer for advising her clients and doing as she is supposed to. 

The only grey area in this whole thing is if police can ask your legal council to leave or stand aside if the proceedings do not currently directly relate to charges (I. E. If you are detained and your lawyer happens to be present can they ignore or remove to ask to leave. I'm guessing it's a no, but have found no documents supporting one way or the other.) |-|

|-| cobo0v3 || -5 || here's the thing, you do not have to answer questions without an attorney present. what the investigators were doing was taking pictures to further an investigation, and not trying to gather information from either suspect. by her stepping in the way and not allowing the officers to take pictures, she can be charged with obstruction of a law enforcement officer, and interfering with a police investigation. police were in the right on this one. |-|

|-| coau681 || 1408 || tell your friends they made a amazing zero-budget commercial. very well done I actually enjoyed watching the video. It was humoring! |-| 
|-| coau5uk || 584 || A little background:

My friend – who plays the leading role – is not an actor. The Director and cameraman are professionals, but did everything in their spare time.

The client (an mc boot manufacturer) supplied them only with a pair of boots and nothing else. The client did not even know what type of commercial that was being made. It was shot during one single day on location at a real MC club in the deep woods of Sweden; Sundbäckens MC.

Everyone appearing in the film are real members of the club. Except for "The Prospect" :)
 |-| 
|-| coazbap || 93 || OMG.. I knew that place rang a bell.
2 Years ago I went with two other Portuguese friends to the Rally of Sweden in Hagfors. 

We were quite tired of driving for hours and we spotted a little place which seemed the kind of place with some good warm coffee and tasty snacks.

We rang the door and were let in to the establishment. That was when we realized the place was actually a bikers club. 

Nevertheless, I walked to the bar and asked for three coffees, which I wasn't really sure anymore if they had it.


There was a guy sitting on a high chair, exactly where you see the actor keeps slipping his boot at the bar, I was standing next to him when I asked for the coffees. Highly intoxicated, he turned slowly to me and said.. "Pppffffff... coffffeeeee....you pussyyy".

We got a few looks, being foreigners, Portuguese looking and asking for coffee at a bikers club.. so we decided to finish our coffees outside and went on our way.

Never thought I would see that place on reddit, brings me fun memories.

|-| coav3cx || 4 || Very good, and watchable throughout.

I felt like there was no... no *pop* when *new boots, membership granted* event happened, though. Maybe, I dunno, a pause, a closeup on the boots (on the kickstarter?) Every shot was perfect, but it all flowed evenly past the main shot! :-) |-|

|-| cob5fww || 3 || I have a pair of Lindstrands, they are unbreakable. A dog bit me once in it, not a single scratch, and it was a big dog. |-|

|-| cob6oxu || 3 || That was really well made. Genuinely impressed.

It got the point across purely through what you see, kept it entertaining, the editing and sound design was spot on. It was just....I couldnt fault it.

Well done!!! |-| 
|-| cob2qnf || 7 || The production values were outstanding but conceptually, it was weak and the story dragged on for too long. Didn't need to be beaten over the head with six examples of how slippery things were. I think we got it the first three times.  |-| 
|-| cob5jyi || 16 || /r/hailcorporate |-| 
|-| coaz3dg || 43 || Zero Budget yes, but just because people are working for free with free stuff. You could make a hollywood movie with zero budget if people worked for free and provided free gear. 

People still committed time into the project.

Nice video still! Just, you know zero budget isn't really zero budget. |-| 
|-| cob8cbg || 3 || I liked it but thought that boots on the road at the end sent the wrong message - that the Prospect had left the boots behind. I think it would be better to show the "stashing away scene" followed by a "showing the product" scene at the end. Similar to what you have but ordered differently. |-| 
|-| cob2stn || 4 || I personally thought it was really good for something done within a day. The only "problem" I can think of is the close-up shot of the bikers jacket at the start. It was pretty hard to read because it wasn't still. (Probably just me). If the last cut was more 'impactful' it would've been better but for something done within such a budget/time, this is far better than anything I can produce.

|-| cob42j2 || 6 || Advertising major here. This was one of the better commercials I have seen recently, and yes I am including most of the ads that were run during the super bowl. The cinematography was excellent, the story was awesome, and the product's entrance could not have been better. I strive to make more ads like this one. |-| 
|-| cob6jah || 3 || Hollywood commercial editor here, so going to give you some agency/marketing style notes.

First off it is great, he did a great job, fun story, great way to show off the product.

Main issue is it takes about 15 secs for the "joke" to get started. I wanted more joke less set up. I think the one thing I would change is not start with the raking the leaves. It's just hard to tell he slipped because of his boots. It is also one of the best comic moments but would play better as a latter "slip".

It is long but its a :60 and :60s are long. I would challenge him to try and tell the story in a :30 also and see how it plays out. I feel it maybe more exciting, catching as a :30. |-| 
|-| cob4e81 || 3 || Nice ad but I hate the term zero budget. You involved people donating time and equipment. Money may not have been spent but there was still investment. 

Plus if they didn't feed the cast that is utterly dickish.  |-| 
|-| cob6j56 || 3 || Very impressive! The one change I'd make would be to show a pile of the abandoned boots in the middle of the road, not the Lindstrands. Slightly better comedy and also it looks a little like they're abandoning the Lindstrands there in the road, not the old ones. I'd then fade to black and show the Lindstrands on a black background.  |-|

|-| cobr6gi || 113 || Bio-mechanically speaking, those are open palmed punches. They aren't slaps. A slap is a flick of the wrist that focuses energy onto the skin of the target (in this case, the cheek). The intention is to deliver a burning sensation to the skin. the hand motion is calculated to stop exactly at the point of the target to deliver a whiplike snap into it.

By contrast, a punch involves a wholesale transfer of energy THROUGH a target. As such, the puncher uses all of his body and the movement is coordinated in stages from the feet to the hips to the trunk to the shoulders and elbow and on sequentially into the hand with the goal being the displacement of the target. That's what this was. The last guy's energy was transferred with a flexed arm through a rigid heel of his hand.  That's a punch. It's very awkward for a punch, but it's a punch nonetheless.  |-|

I found the arrangement dull, especially during the verses. It might be symptomatic of the original, which is quite simple (but so catchy!). I think I would've liked more brass and a more layered sound throughout. The whole thing feels spare to me.

That said, good solos and nice harmonizing. Like many others, I dig the edge to the vocals. So I didn't like the arrangement, but the execution was really good. Keep it up :) |-| 
|-| cob6axl || 56 || Love the vocal fry of the lead. Love the gypsy chords used, so django! Awesome job!

|-| cob9kji || 17 || When I was in my junior year of High School my family wasn't really doing all that well. Christmas was coming up and I knew that there probably wasn't going to be much in the way of presents. It wasn't really a big deal to me but I could tell my parents were pretty depressed about the situation. Christmas morning came and there were a few little things my parents managed to scrounge together under the tree. We heard a car door close and and ran to the window just in time to see a gold truck pull away. Went to the door and found two packages sitting on the doorstep addressed to me and my sister. There was a bunch of gifts inside of each of the boxes. It was amazing and a Christmas I will never forget. To this day I still have no clue who did that for my family but I try to pay it forward any chance I get now. I would to thank that person, but I don't think I will ever get the chance. I hope to tell this story to my son when he gets a little older in the hopes he gets a lesson from it as well.  |-|

|-| cobi9j5 || 3 || So many questions. Why didn't he build a bridge instead of a house? If he couldn't build a bridge, then why not an over hanging platform that goes out far enough so that he could make the jump? Where did he even get the stuff to build a house? Why not jump off of the roof of the house in order to make it across? Fall damage? Why do I over analyze everything??? |-| 
|-| cobk847 || 4 || I have something not quite the same, but [also good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiePaAHK3jE&amp;list=FLj4Hk1FsU7ZPyku3PlK8olA&amp;index=14). |-| 
|-| cobk4l3 || 3 || Wasn't this already made? I remember a couple months ago the exact same story animated in this style in /r/videos.  |-| 
|-| cobkfbp || 3 || isn't there something else 100% exactly like this? |-| 
|-| cob64ab || 4 || &gt;Based on the original story of *"We Go Forward"* (Owl Turd Comix)

What a name... Owl Turd Comix. |-| 
|-| cobs8nv || 26 || She's  really funny. The laughter  ruined it a bit, i couldn't  hear half of what she said. |-| 
|-| cobpjnu || 15 || I could watch this women forever! |-| 
|-| cobu2zn || 11 || "She's a whore" 

Gad damn that was simultaneously completely expected but also completely unexpected for me |-| 
|-| cobrjkr || 8 || That shit about Jay Leno had me laughing out loud. |-| 
|-| cobttlm || 5 || This lady is like r/AskReddit. Ask a simple question, get destroyed.  |-| 
|-| cobuqgz || 4 || I remember when she made several appearances on the Tonight Show in the years before she passed away.  She was a cookbook author and also Truman Capote's aunt with whom he lived with at times during his childhood.  The lady was such an interesting character and was beloved by The Tonight Show audience. |-| 
|-| cobq4ns || 4 || never heard of her, thanks much |-| 
|-| cobt20g || 3 || I think I'm in love. |-| 
|-| cobj4f9 || 16 || I'm lucky I guess. I don't even have time to look at the clock. Its Break, Lunch, What?! Home time already?! |-| 
|-| cobjmb8 || 44 || you spend all day waiting to meet your gay lover? |-| 
|-| cobhyc7 || 22 || I gave up wearing a watch because of this same scenario.  I hate work so much. |-| 
|-| cobr84w || 7 || I actually wish this were the case.I find,especially as I get older,that the days go whizzing by regardless of whether I'm engaged or bored,ending of course with the inevitable.If boredom could somehow "keep me here longer" I think I'd welcome it,as I'm not looking forward to the alternative.  |-| 
|-| cobncgj || 10 || People who have their dream jobs look at it the other way. 

I only have 8 hours to work on this today.  |-| 
|-| cobhs4d || 8 || I miss this show! |-| 
|-| cobq5il || 3 || We all have 8 hrs a day at work. When the day is spent productively and I take on more responsibility, then the day pass buy quick. I dont earn more, but i gain reputation, and more opportunities are available.  |-| 
|-| cobquj9 || 3 || My life except 12hr days, usually never look at the clock till 10pm, then again at Noon, then every hour after that until the final hour, then every 10 min.

Pays well though.  |-|

|-| cobnvnx || 18 || From his [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Fulara):
&gt;The reason for his grimace was that the expression enhances his ability to achieve faster and more accurate tapping abilities. |-| 
|-| cobnlxm || 27 || His default face is a prolapsed butthole.  |-| 
|-| cobrgit || 13 || When you nut but she still suckin'. |-| 
|-| cobp10j || 7 || He is that good because he sold his soul to the devil. He makes that face because the devil took his butt hole instead. |-| 
|-| cobo5q8 || 6 || http://i.imgur.com/HAUVo0u.png |-| 
|-| cobtazb || 6 || Playing like that, he can make any damn face he wants! |-| 
|-| cobou8j || 4 || It's because he's strumming with his cock.  |-| 
|-| cobswgf || 8 || One of the most extraordinary pieces of playing I've ever seen. Incredible virtuosity.  |-|

|-| cob1fm8 || 18 || Vaccinations are so hot right now. |-| 
|-| coawffh || 33 || OP this video has been reposted so many times. 

[I think we all know what you need to do](http://youtu.be/nc_LIR5ExIU) |-| 
|-| cob1p20 || 20 || Well OP, I havent seen this.

Now on topic. Its pretty cool how they built this argument. They actually found common ground, showed how the view is moronic regardless, and destroyed it. Sadly, none of this matters to anti vacc people. Because they think they're smarter than everyone. Full cup and all that. |-| 
|-| cobheer || 4 || Believe it or not, this is the first time I've seen this. |-| 
|-| cob9lp5 || 3 || I call dibs on reposting this next week! |-| 
|-| cob4uv9 || -7 || Ohhh the good old reddit circle jerk. This week vaccines. Hop on that wagon OP you goddamn sheep |-| 
|-| cob9f24 || -7 || Reddit overblows this whole anti-vaccination thing so fucking hard, its ridiculous.  |-| 
|-| cob4st4 || -3 || I don't have cable but it's funny to see how much influence CNN has over everyone these days. |-| 
|-| coawc76 || -12 || excellent show / episode.  so do you believe it? |-| 
|-| cobb4re || 47 || Misses trick ----&gt; Scratches dick |-|

|-| cobmqve || 23 || Persona 4 song represent! |-| 
|-| cobn5ia || 18 || Persona 4 is thug now. |-|

song |-| 
|-| coboscq || 43 || Now, disclaimer, this guy is a scum bag, and I don't like many aspects of his persona.

However, I kinda sympathize with this one. Skateboarding is a kind of skill that requires endless practice. You're going to fuck it up, over and over and over again if you want to actually get it right. It's pretty hard for the kid when there's all these people watching, and giving him shit every time he fucks up. 

That said, I have to give him props for getting back on the board and continuing to fuck up the trick until he gets it, despite videos like this one, and others. |-| 
|-| cobpapi || 6 || LOL that Persona 4 music.. best Thug Life video I've ever seen. |-| 
|-| cobopvq || 6 || If I were him I'd just build my own skate park on my property. It's gotta suck to go out in public trying to learn something as hard as skateboarding while being as famous as he is. |-| 
|-| coboa2l || 10 || Every video, picture, or anything about justin bieber for that matter I've seen on reddit and no where else. I think reddit secretly loves this guy.  |-| 
|-| cobp6ba || 4 || I don't care how many skateboard tricks you land, I would still rather have over one hundred million dollars. |-| 
|-| cobjb3q || -5 || out of the two, i think justin bieber still comes out on top. |-| 
|-| cobjyv1 || -4 || Except its impossible to land a 360 flip when you're a poonanner and immediately reach for the ground with your back foot after you spin and flip the board... he'll bust his shins 1000 times while learning this trick this way. It will be awesome.  |-| 
|-| cobczhj || -8 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| cobom4b || -4 || Maybe, just MAYBE, you'd pull that off if your pants were fucking on right, you idiot. |-| 
|-| cobmqty || -4 || How come I keep seeing videos of this kid sucking at skateboarding now?  I just saw [this](http://www.tmz.com/2014/12/29/justin-bieber-skateboarding-video-falling-stairs-nyc/) one the other day.   |-| 
|-| cobokpa || -4 || How adorable. It's nice to see the Bieber boy getting along with all the other children. |-|
