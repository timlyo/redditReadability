Those people may not have a dollar a day but they have tribal land and livestock and homes that they've built. Do you need money when you have everything you need? They get jobs to buy beer and phones and radios and stuff like that. Not nearly as bleak as it seems. I mean how many of us have our own land, animals and homes? Or the means for our own survival? Yet these stats get thrown around and we pity these people. Like without money you can't live or something.  |-|

In less then 20 years France will have a Muslim majority and its French White skinned history will slowly start being contained and repressed over time. Muslims opposed to the West long since figured out that in the absence of modern armies and weapons, out breeding their enemy was the next best thing. It tables the fight until the numbers make it no contest. France will be the 22nd century example of incredibly irresponsible 20th/21st century immigration policies gone horribly wrong, and serve as a warning to other nations of what can happen to your country within 50 years if you do it all wrong headed. Sometimes doing the right thing is in fact the wrong thing. France will be the example. Down vote if you like, but I speak absolute truth. |-|

"Keeping America competitive requires us to be hit again."

"Our government has a right to choose between buying food and buying prescriptions."

"Americans should not rise any faster than the rate of return on success, and I support a new television service will begin to claim Social Security."

"Today marks the official retirement of a new effort to encourage the good of families, represented here this evening by Sergeant Norwood's mom and dad, Janet, sent me a letter to the enemy and spare innocent lives, and we will."

"America will continue to lead because it would keep us from helping our friends, our Nation has superb professionals in law enforcement to concentrate on those who earn low wages"

"We will increase our research in better batteries for hybrid and electric cars and in caves, and it will help our economy."

Founder here.
This is the beta v1.0.

Noticed an influx of traffic and figured someone reposted to reddit.

V1.0 was never meant to get posted or popular -- so don't judge based on this release.  Lots of problems with it.

It was about a year ago this was made.

V2.0 is coming soon in about 4-5 months.

If you have any questions or suggestions, message me.

Cheers,

Marc |-|
