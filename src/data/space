|-| cntxppx || 14 || Dawn is at ~Earth-Moon distance from Ceres! I beg to differ with NASA: These pictures are significantly better than the best from Hubble. You can make out 4 craters in the movie, and one very clear crater with a central peak in the enhanced still frame. The best Hubble images were never that good.

Here is the story on the Dawn web site.

http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/feature_stories/Dawn_delivers_new_image.asp

Thanks Liz, it's a great story. (Liz Landau is the person in the JPL public relations office who wrote the story.) |-| 
|-| cnty7dv || 19 || Gotta wonder about the bright spot next to the darker, larger spot at the top left.  Ice? |-| 
|-| cntz8o7 || 4 || Maybe not better than Hubble, but this looks far more useful

Frames are good |-| 
|-| cntzcqn || 6 || It's still not sinking in that this thing is round. I haven't seen anything like this since the early moon passes of Cassini. |-| 
|-| cntzpu0 || 6 || It's funny how we can see galaxies billions of light years away but can't be sure of the existence of a planetary body just outside our own solar system. |-| 
|-| cnu0cew || 8 || Yea I just saw it to on the jpl website, it is f*cking amazing to see!

I was/am really looking forward to see better pictures from Ceres and from Pluto this year. |-| 
|-| cnu0e55 || 4 || [full article](http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/dawn-delivers-new-image-of-ceres/#.VL1I0UfF_IY) |-| 
|-| cnu119a || 15 || You gotta wonder what that bright spot is. I can't wait for more close-up photos! |-| 
|-| cnu3bwm || 7 || Pretty standard for certain types of nozzles, but good on you for doing your own research. |-| 
|-| cnu4ihk || 6 || This is so exciting. Seeing it in motion really brings it to life so to speak. 2015 is going to be such a great year. |-| 
|-| cnu7j73 || -4 || Honestly, how can people say the inner rocky debris from the Solar system's early history are 'planets?'  Do the inner rocky worlds look like Jupiter or Saturn?  They look more like moons of those worlds.  Pluto got kicked out of the planet club, those inner rocks look a lot more like Pluto than Uranus.   |-| 
|-| cnud8hz || 18 || Mars has water we can unfreeze and drink, it doesn't have any oxygen but it has an atmosphere and temperatures that at least in the day time range from winter weather cold up to a few days a year that get up to the 70 or 80s in the tropics. 

The moon on the other hand is -300 degrees at night and 250 degrees in the day and has no atmosphere and also is baked nonstop in radiation and is basically a barren hellscape made of loose dust that slowly ruins everything it touches.  |-| 
|-| cnudk4g || 4 || Moon's escape velocity is about 2.4 km/s while Earth's about 11.2 km/s.
I suspect the first stage could lift the rocket to orbit from the Moon with no problem.
So most of the energy in the fuel of the Saturn V could be use to speed up the rocket... 
Can somebody do the Math's on this? I calculated the kinetic energy that the Saturn V had had at Earth's and Moon's, escape velocity and assumed that the difference could be used to accelerate the rocket in space but... how do I calculate how much would that translate into velocity?    |-| 
|-| cnuerjw || 7 || This image was captured from a distance of 383,000 kilometers.
The distance to the Moon is 384,400 kilometers.

Ceres has a radius of 487 kilometers.
The Moon has a radius of 1737 kilometers.

The image of Ceres is 27 pixels wide
Moon imaged by Dawn from the same distance would be just 96 pixels wide

I can take a better image of the Moon with a small zoom camera. I wonder why they couldn't fit a small reconnaissance instrument. I am sure there is a good reason, and I would really want to find out.
 |-| 
|-| cnugj5m || 5 || This is the most exciting thing happening in Science right now.

There is a non-zero chance that Ceres has an ocean beneath its surface. We'll know in a few months.

If it has an ocean, it immediately becomes the easiest place in the solar system to look for life (it doesn't require some crazy entry-descent-landing system like Mars does, it doesn't require the long trip &amp; high radiation tolerances that exploring Jovian moons does, etc.)

If it has an ocean, even if Ceres is completely sterile, it becomes the easiest place in the solar system to use as a refueling depot for exploring beyond Mars. Water breaks down into oxygen &amp; hydrogen - rocket fuel, as well as consumables for human crews. Taking off and landing on Ceres is trivial due to its low gravity. |-| 
|-| cnukyqr || 125 || This is one of those rare moments that I almost can't believe the picture isn't fake. |-| 
|-| cnum0rl || 4 || It helped me to consider just two dimensions. Is the surface of a ball finite or infinite? Does it end anywhere? The same idea goes for just one dimension if you consider a closed loop. Now extend this idea to three dimensions, which is harder to visualize but follows the same principle. |-| 
|-| cnunfbs || 4 || There's a lot of misinformed people here. With SpaceX the reason is because Mars holds more long term potential because there is a possibility that it can be terraformed. Mars One is run by idiots. |-| 
|-| cnunzc9 || 17 || When was this taken? Where is it? Can it still be observed high in the sky? Is it a naked eye object yet?

I'm sort of nestled on a slope with tall trees and a valley so I'm really kind of limited on the horizon. |-| 
|-| cnuoj1h || 14 || Google. The planet is 100% behind you on this investment. Please follow through. It might be the most important investment you ever made as a company not just for your future but the future of man kind. I'm not sensationalizing. Space exploration is THAT important. |-| 
|-| cnuphwu || 10 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| cnupi8i || 8 || If it wasn't broadcasting any radio waves, or reflecting lots of light with mirrors, I kind of doubt it. It would probably just go right by unnoticed. |-| 
|-| cnuprem || 96 || Berta has finally ascended to the stars, from her humble Youtube/reddit beginnings, it brings a tear to my eye. :*) |-| 
|-| cnupyjx || 4 || If the probe isn't broadcasting an waves, we would miss it entirely. If it was traveling in a cluster of similarly sized objects, we might look out for a meteor shower that night. |-| 
|-| cnuqcci || 7 || Why is there such little discussion of this event? Isn't this huge news? |-| 
|-| cnuqkq6 || 59 || Wow. Berta has transcended beyond the need for us males. She was right. |-|

|-| cnuru91 || 3 || Try to make it easier on yourself instead of harder. 

Break up every word into two groups.

Matter

Idea

If it is matter, it has shape. It has location. It exists.
If it does not have matter, it is an idea. An idea is an explanation for the actions of matter.

Infinity is not matter, so it is an idea. 

EveryTHING is matter, space is the opposite. It is not a thing. Things have size. Space has distance, between things. Infinite is a mathematical word, not really a good science term for explaining the distance between things.

Imagine you are the last thing away from all other things. If every material was behind you, you would just be farther from those things. You would have no way to measure how far you could go, because you would be able to keep going. The distance you go is the distance you go (not infinite). You could not see any THING in front of you.

But you can't really keep going, because of gravity. Well they try to explain gravity but I don't think they do a very good job by giving you an equation to show the magic of action at a distance.

Gravity is every other THING pulling on you as you try to go in any direction. If you were that far away from all other matter it would take more than all the energy in all the matter, because you are pulling (trying to) all the matter. So gravity shows us all THINGS are connected and that space is an illusion. Just an idea of NOTHING or that which is not matter.

As far as END, there's another idea. ;) |-|

Updates can be found here http://www.spacearchive.info/vafbsked.htm

EDIT 2: Thanks for all the additional suggestions!  This is great. I have to step away from the computer for the evening but I'll update the list with the remaining suggestions when i get back.  Thanks everyone! |-| 
|-| cnv0m6h || 50 || Wait hold up, whats this about 2015 being a year with fireball meteors? |-| 
|-| cnv1be3 || 24 || I'd like to add 3 rocket launches from California to your list.

* JAN 29 - Delta II - Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite.

|-| cnv31zq || 7 || Does anyone else find the perspective...frightening? It almost feels like the Earth is above you rather than below you. |-| 
|-| cnv3a6e || 24 || So New Horizons is just going to pass by Pluto? What would it have taken to entered orbit with it? |-| 
|-| cnv4luw || 4 || Also this does not include the Google Lunar X Prize competition. Astrobotic Technology should be the first private company to land on the moon and they will dropping a can of Pocari Sweat on it. |-|

https://forekast.com/events/show/54affa70666b7726f7080000 |-| 
|-| cnv5hhw || 12 || A small thing: LISA pathfinder will actually be insensitive to gravitational wave signals and is more accurately a technology demonstration mission. |-| 
|-| cnv5vin || 9 || Would be lovely to mention that Philae and Rosetta are ESA missions, since everything else is flagged as NASA. |-| 
|-| cnv6iog || 4 || It'd be awesome if we could have this until 2018 or so, then we'd be able to print it off as a calendar! |-| 
|-| cnv6w00 || 5 || Missing what is possibly the most important event (although there is no specific date): SpaceX lands a rocket. 

Also: Falcon Heavy. |-| 
|-| cnv79wp || 145 || Just FYI, the 1-year stay in space is a first for NASA but not for the Russians. [Valeri Polyakov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Polyakov) spent 437 continuous days in space aboard Mir in 1994/1995. |-| 
|-| cnv7ozl || 272 || [Inverted colors](https://i.imgur.com/OnQCLrN.jpg) for those that want to print and save toner. |-| 
|-| cnv7vto || 15 || Could there be a google calendar for this? Of all the official crap that pops up (princesses birthday, or anyone elses, and easter), this would be interesting. |-| 
|-| cnv88u8 || 17 || July 14, New Horizons!  I can't wait to see high res pictures of Pluto.  As a little kid it disappointed me so much that it was the only planet in space books without real pictures.  Second most exciting event of the year after the new Star Wars. ;) |-| 
|-| cnv8aks || 4 || So the SpaceX cargo missions to ISS are worth mentioning but the manned launches are not? Well, I guess they are just boring and routine flights.. |-| 
|-| cnv8jks || 3 || Anyone have a link to a stream? Took a quick look at NASA tv and didn't see anything on the schedule. 

Edit: http://www.ulalaunch.com/webcast.aspx I think I found it. |-| 
|-| cnv8tg3 || 5 || Isn't there a superb solar eclipse for North America this year? 

I'm probably wrong.  |-| 
|-| cnv8uar || 5 || I remember learning about New Horizons back when I was in elementary school, and how it would reach Pluto in 2015.

The future is here, everyone |-| 
|-| cnv97qx || 4 || [Here's the animated money shot](http://i.imgur.com/e5ghnlC.gif)...definitely some kind of bright crater there, which got me thinking: what are they going to name it?

Each solar system body has it's own [naming convention for various features](http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/Categories). It turns out Ceres' convention is the names of gods and goddesses of agriculture.

EDIT: Looks like someone has already posted a [more stabilized version](http://i.imgur.com/mcO7mY6.gif) in this subreddit. |-| 
|-| cnv9b1d || 3 || Thank you for this.  Now I at least know that on July 14 (Perseid) and on December 13-14 (Geminid) there will be overcast where I live preceded and followed by 6 straight beautiful cloudless nights. |-| 
|-| cnv9n6i || 4 || For a even more detailed overview of 2015 you can also check out wikipedia.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_in_spaceflight |-| 
|-| cnva34l || 7 || It left out the lunar eclipse on September 28.  But whatevs, seen one seen them all right? |-| 
|-| cnva4ff || 9 || No one seems that excited by this, but I can't wait to see it up close! A dwarf planet in the inner solar system with a possible internal ocean. Freakin' awesome if you ask me. 

&gt; Ceres appears to be differentiated into a rocky core and icy mantle, and may harbor an internal ocean of liquid water under its surface. The surface is probably a mixture of water ice and various hydrated minerals such as carbonates and clay. In January 2014, emissions of water vapor were detected from several regions of Ceres. This was somewhat unexpected, as large bodies in the asteroid belt do not typically emit vapor, a hallmark of comets.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet) |-| 
|-| cnva91c || 20 || Fun fact! Ceres which is now classified as a Dwarf Planet used to be considered a full planet for half a century.  That's where we get Cerium on the periodic table (to go along with Neptunium, Plutonium, Uranium, Tellurium [earth]).  Pallas was another "planet" which gave us palladium. |-| 
|-| cnvaz29 || 35 || One of the biggest things I'm looking forward to is May 5th. That's when the exciting part of New Horizons really starts, since that's the point when its pictures will exceed [Hubble's]( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Pluto_animiert_200px.gif ) in quality.  |-| 
|-| cnvbkoe || 5 || I wouldn't call 46 parsecs close. 

Thats 149.86 light years away. 

Sure on the cosmic scale thats close but I did some napkin calculations and if we traveled as fast as the fastest man made object ever created (Juno probe at 25 miles per second). It would take us **7470.95** years to reach it. |-| 
|-| cnvc8f5 || 8 || Thats just so cool to be able to see what its like on the surface of another planet thats tens of millions of miles away. Its too bad we're only on this rock for about 100 years, its a drop in the ocean compared to the scale of nearly everything else in the universe. I feel like we're getting robbed in the life expectancy department. 
 |-| 
|-| cnvcelr || 4 || Does Ceres being classified as a dwarf planet mean it isn't also an asteroid?  Pluto is a dwarf planet, but is also a Kuiper Belt Object, right? |-| 
|-| cnve8ap || 13 || Glad to hear the news! With the support of Google I Hope this propels SpaceX further into space! |-| 
|-| cnvfnf9 || 3 || I'm confused....

March - Launch of eight new GPS sat

June - Launch of tenth new GPS sat...

What is it about the ninth what makes us want to skip it, I know this is Microsofts stance...? |-| 
|-| cnvgzt7 || 6 || Interesting that Fidelity is involved. They wouldn't invest in this without expecting concrete return. Google OTOH commonly invests in promising tech without a clear path to profitability. |-| 
|-| cnvhmer || 9 || "We are a way for the Cosmos to know itself". How do we go about that "way"? By investing in the people, and the companies who instead of looking straight forward, look up.  The human race takes another step in the right direction and I'm more optimistic than ever seeing news like this.  |-| 
|-| cnvivx8 || 20 || I apologize if this has been posted already. If so, I will delete the post in due haste. |-| 
|-| cnvjmf2 || 44 || Ohhh ok, let me just record this UFO report down using my invisible typewriter...

*tap tap tap* |-| 
|-| cnvjp9s || 5 || I will pay all the monies to be rid of the likes of Rogers and Bell here in Canada. Google might as well refocus from their fiber plans and shift to this, less fighting devil incarnate every inch of cable laid. |-|

|-| cnvneef || 7 || Question: what would NASA gain from doing things like this? I see crap all the time about how NASA is trying to hide the existence of UFO's or aliens. If they discovered ETs would announcing it not be a good way to get funding? |-| 
|-| cnvnhtb || 9 || ~~NASA cuts ISS live feed after UFO appears, with conspiracy theorists going wild~~

NASA lose ISS live feed after the moon rises above the horizon, with conspiracy theorist going wild. |-| 
|-| cnvov8y || 7 || This is nothing against some UFO guy who claimed in his YouTube video, that ESA (or NASA - it was obvious cover up... ) sent Rosetta spacecraft to comet because military discovered radio signals coming from that comet and they assumed that they are generated by an alien solar system spy outpost... |-| 
|-| cnvqjdl || 31 || If this video were timestamped, then surely someone smarter than myself would be able to look up the position of the ISS at the time, figured out the direction the camera was facing, and determined where the moon should appear, right? Does this live feed have a timestamp, or did the youtube poster remove it? |-| 
|-| cnvrabq || 5 || This image appears to be missing the [Green Bank Telescope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bank_Telescope), which is a 100m x 110m elliptical dish radio telescope, fully steerable.   |-| 
|-| cnvri0k || 20 || Perhaps the camera picked up a classified military craft and cut the feed because of that. Seems more plausible than blurry aliens. |-| 
|-| cnvtmzo || 27 || Cameras are switched automatically and it takes some seconds. During the switch the still image is shown. NASA didn't cut anything, this is how the HDEV experiment works.

In the video you can see that the camera is switched from the forward looking "horizon view" to the downward looking "birdview".

Edit: A word. |-| 
|-| cnvuc84 || 3 || Yahoo! is really bad lately linking to Inquisitr, Examiner and other tabloid nonprofessional sites yapping about UFOs...:( |-| 
|-| cnvutwl || 6 || Uninformed article first of all; as others noted the camera turns off regularly automatically. The youtube user "Streetcap1" has multiple video uploads of other UFO videos; suspicious level +1, bias level +1. The video quality is lower than it ought to be; those cameras can do better than the stream "Streetcap1" presents in his video. It seems the video is fake, people. |-|

|-| cnvwc8b || 51 || Sorry to bring this to you guys, but the "grey UFO" is actually the Moon ;) You can see alot of photos and videos of moonrise from ISS. The guy from youtube channel made the video quality so low because otherwise it would be super obvious what you can see there.

|-| cnvxs0p || 8 || It could be an alien craft tens of kilometers in diameter that was only spotted from the ISS and not by anybody under it (where it would light up the entire sky.)

Let me know if you have any questions. |-| 
|-| cnx9x5p || 51 || That is highly exaggerated. You wouldn't be able to tell the orbit was elliptical with just your eye without measuring it because it is so close to being a circle.  |-| 
|-| cnxa5ff || 4 || So if anything between around 260 - 310 K is livable we've already got ~30 or so planet candidates. |-| 
|-| cnxasxm || 3 || That is ridiculously out of proportion to reality. If the sun were twice as close during part of the year, it would appear twice as large in the sky. The tilt of the planet would have nearly no impact on the seasons, because the difference caused by the tilt would be completely overwhelmed by the massive increase in heat when the sun was at its closest point. We'd either all fry in the summer or we'd all freeze in the winter. |-| 
|-| cnxc3wt || 3 || Wow, so out of proportion. At its furthest point in orbit, the earth is 95 million miles from the sun. At its closest it's 92 million miles. This distance is so negligible that the northern hemisphere's summer occurs at the further distance. If this animation were true the earth's tilt would have no affect on the seasons and we'd all experience summer and winter at the same time. Also I'm pretty sure all the ice caps would melt if we spent half the year 3 times closer to the sun.  |-| 
|-| cnxc5nk || 3 || Honestly, I find it extremely ignorant to think we're alone in this vast expanse of space. It's too large for us to be the only intelligent beings, or planet that contains life. I have no doubt there are extraterrestrials, but I also think it would be hard for us to find them, considering the depth and size of the universe &amp; so-on. |-| 
|-| cnxclge || 6 || Why does the noontime sun location make that figure 8 shape? Why doesn't the sun just go up and down? |-| 
|-| cnxd9ge || 7 || Never did I think I would consider the friggin' SUN to be too small. |-| 
|-| cnxetxp || 6 || I cant speculate on how big... but to give you some context for a comet impact. 

Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 impacted Jupiter at  216,000 km/h in 1994 and was observed from earth. 

From WIKI

&gt;The first impact occurred at 20:13 UTC on July 16, 1994, when fragment A of the nucleus entered Jupiter's southern hemisphere at a speed of about 60 km/s.[2] Instruments on Galileo detected a fireball which reached a peak temperature of about 24,000 K, compared to the typical Jovian cloudtop temperature of about 130 K, before expanding and cooling rapidly to about 1500 K after 40 s. The plume from the fireball quickly reached a height of over 3,000 km.[17] A few minutes after the impact fireball was detected, Galileo measured renewed heating, probably due to ejected material falling back onto the planet. Earth-based observers detected the fireball rising over the limb of the planet shortly after the initial impact.[18]

&gt;Despite published predictions,[13] astronomers had not expected to see the fireballs from the impacts[19] and did not have any idea in advance how visible the other atmospheric effects of the impacts would be from Earth. Observers soon saw a huge dark spot after the first impact. The spot was visible even in very small telescopes, and was about 6,000 km (3,700 mi) (one Earth radius) across. This and subsequent dark spots were thought to have been caused by debris from the impacts, and were markedly asymmetric, forming crescent shapes in front of the direction of impact.[20]

&gt;Over the next 6 days, 21 distinct impacts were observed, with the largest coming on July 18 at 07:33 UTC when fragment G struck Jupiter. **This impact created a giant dark spot over 12,000 km across, and was estimated to have released an energy equivalent to 6,000,000 megatons of TNT (600 times the world's nuclear arsenal)**.[21] Two impacts 12 hours apart on July 19 created impact marks of similar size to that caused by fragment G, and impacts continued until July 22, when fragment W struck the planet.[22]


Diameter of Earth for the record is a little under 13000 km. 

&gt;The comet was observed as a series of fragments ranging up to 2 km (1.2 mi) in diameter

 |-| 
|-| cnxf3rk || 4 || Well, [Chicxulub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater) was in the neighborhood of 10km in diameter and it certainly caused "damage all over earth."  If there were a similar strike today, it might not kill ALL of humanity, but it would sure get most of us--if not directly, then by wiping our huge sections of the food chain and nuclear winter and acid rain and so on.

Now if the impactor were, say, 50 km in diameter . . . or 100 . . .  

 |-| 
|-| cnxfd70 || 7 || This is really cool. Russia has historically had better luck with Venus than anyone else. Great to see them getting back to inter planetary stuff.

EDIT _ Looks like the order is in the title WHOOPS! |-| 
|-| cnxquii || -14 || What I find most surprising about this is that they call 1,504 adults over a four day period to be "the public." Seriously? You can't do any kind of serious population analysis with a response pool of only 1,500 people! &lt;/rant&gt;

Edit: Yes, I looked it up and apparently you *can* get a general idea of what a total population feels like if you have a random culling of poll takers. Probability and statistics has won me over. I stand corrected. |-| 
|-| cnxsxdk || 10 || It always annoys me how wrong the distances between planets or the sizes of planets are displayed. I know it should be common knowledge that most of the models displayed in videos or books are topological and not topographical, still, not even mentioning that fact is a bad thing to do in my opinion.

Here is a good site to grasp the size of the soloar system
http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html
(I recommend hitting the small "c" button ant the lower right corner)

Especially the ellipse of earths orbit seems extremely exaggerated. |-| 
|-| cnxtg0u || 117 || Awesome! And now we can look forward to another 40 years or so of Congress and the president completely ignoring NASA despite what the public thinks, because who cares about them?  |-| 
|-| cnxu4f1 || 56 || I think this graph has no further "meaning" other than NASA is the largest non-political agency. Space exploration hasn't been defined and drilled into the 'values' of a party so no politician has any reason to dislike it.  |-| 
|-| cnxuxi3 || 31 || How in the hell could anybody have an unfavorable opinion attitude towards NASA?  |-| 
|-| cnxv9fv || 17 || What I find equally interesting is that poll found Democrats more favorable towards almost every government agency with the sole exception of the CIA. It's interesting how, on the face of it at least, the Democrats are generally more supportive of government agencies, the Republicans are less supportive of government agencies, and those who are Independent tend to only strongly support government agencies directly related to health and science (namely CDC and NASA). |-| 
|-| cnxvfkr || 95 || At first I thought it was ridiculous that any federal agency had a higher approval rating, but the CDC is kind of ridiculously important.  |-| 
|-| cnxvlms || 36 || It's funny, I actually like the IRS...

They seem to do their job well... |-| 
|-| cnxvmbh || -10 || Are we supposed to believe these numbers? I've never been asked for my opinion about anything... Has anyone on here actually been a part of one of these polls? (Ex: Do you like NASA?)  |-| 
|-| cnxvt9i || 4 || Can we compare budgets now too? I'd bet they have to least amount of money for the highest favorability rating. So sad. We put a man on the moon so long ago, and since, we've had the money to go into low Earth orbit a handful of times.  
  
NASA should just lie and say that if we get people on Mars, we'll be able to control every ones minds. The US government would have us there tomorrow. |-| 
|-| cnxvvpx || 5 || This is precisely why nobody wants to fund it. How can one side support something the other side likes? ***It's preposterous!*** |-| 
|-| cnxw7oo || 3 || Frankly I'm shocked the average citizen even viewed the IRS as favorably as they did |-| 
|-| cnxwcn6 || 3 || Impossible. Republicans all hate science because they don't understand it. They hate NASA for sending rockets up to heaven to hurt God. 

Post Neil deGrasse Tyson memes if you agree. |-| 
|-| cnxxcnh || 3 || I taught a masters-level class in systems engineering using this book as the textbook. It had lots of useful information for a systems engineer trainee, and it was free -- a terrific advantage over most of the other textbooks on systems engineering.

I understand that book -- from 2007 -- is being revised right now. If you have some comments on what works or what doesn't in that book, what should be added or deleted, please send them to me and I'll try to get them into the revision process.  |-| 
|-| cnxxz0n || -4 || And now Ted Cruz is in charge of its budget.  So get used to doing space stuff on Earth rather than in space. |-| 
|-| cnxybva || 15 || I find it funny that the DOD is slightly more approved by democrats than republicans despite the belief that republicans war monger. |-| 
|-| cnxyels || 3 || And yet Congress starves them for funds....ever wonder why we rely on the Russians to get people back and forth to the Space Station? 

'Cause we never funded a follow-on to the Shuttle after it aged-out of the system. 

Oh yeah, and Congress cancelled the SSC too... |-| 
|-| cny12rq || 4 || People would rather be spied on that pay taxes according to that chart. :( |-|

|-| co12nvm || 18 || Nice animation, but based on old theory.  The latest evidence suggests that some of the large basins on the near side of the moon, such as the Oceanus Procellarum, [were formed by volcanic activity, not giant impacts.](http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2014/10/moons-vast-ocean-of-storms-reveals-ancient-rifts-of-volcanic-activity-not-a-cosmic-impact-basin.html). |-|

|-| co0zou5 || 7 || Was the volcanic period related to the large impacts directly before? It looks like it from the gif. What was the connection, if so? |-| 
|-| co11la6 || 7 || Most of the moon is the same as it was a billion years ago. That's crazy to think about. There's rocks on the Moon that stayed in the same place from the time of the dinosaurs to today. |-| 
|-| co13cvk || 6 || Did this make anyone weirdly proud of our badass little moon? It sure can take a beating. |-|

oh nevermind: source https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIKmSQqp8wY |-| 
|-| co11eh3 || 3 || So was the moon at one point more perfectly smooth and round? All I can think about is running around it like Goku on King Kai's planet.
 |-| 
|-| co11ezd || 3 || Okay. How do we protect a possible moon base from such bombardment? Have it underground? |-| 
|-| co12io6 || 3 || I'm kind of interested in how the moon was even created to begin with. From the looks of this gif is it just presumed the moon started in a perfect smooth sphere? How did that sphere even come about? |-| 
|-| co17kgw || 3 || Man, how badass would the moon be today if it still had a giant ocean of lava? |-| 
|-| co10bt7 || 3 || I wonder if that's the Great Filter? Like, if our solar system is destined to hit another rough patch of cosmic debris for 100 million years that will bombard humanity out of existence. |-| 
|-| co14gbu || 3 || Imagine how badass it would be to look up in the sky at the moon, and see it half-covered in lava.  |-| 
|-| co16mw3 || 3 || This is an incredibly misleading gif. The period of heavy bombardment wasn't restricted to only basins, but included the vast majority of all highlands craters. So take what they call "intermediate cratering" and shift it earlier to coincide with the basins. The mare volcanism should come after the the bombardment is mostly done. This gif gives the impression that the volcanism is a consequence of the basin formation, which is incorrect. The lavas filled the basins because they were the lowest local topography.

There are a number of other errors. Whoever made this doesn't understand lunar geology very well. |-|

Then God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years; and let them be for lights in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth”; and it was so. God made the two great lights, the greater light to govern the day, and the lesser light to govern the night; He made the stars also. God placed them in the expanse of the heavens to give light on the earth, and to govern the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good. There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day. |-| 
|-| co0q226 || 12 || I always assumed the water was there to stop the launchpad melting.

I only recently found out its main function is to suppress the sound waves generated by the main engines so that they don't bounce back off the ground rip the craft apart on launch.

|-| co0o14s || 6 || Misleading headline for karma hits, it is 3X the distance to the moon away from earth. You might see it with a very large pair of binoculars if you hold them very steady but your best bet is a telescope, it also will not be very bright as Asteroids have a dark surface. It is likely in the Magnitude 10-12 range, just beyond 7x50 binoculars range. If you miss the 45 minutes it is visible it will be back in 1.84 yrs. |-|

Major fail there humanity, major fail. |-| 
|-| co176mp || 6 || I think you can be pretty confident the spot is not a reflection off of a lake. That talk does, however, capture the excitement of discovering features like this on an extraterrestrial body. I think Dawn is going to deliver almost as much exciting information as Cassini/Huygens. |-| 
|-| co0higc || 3 || Will this be visible with the naked eye at all? Because I need to use my eyes to line up my telescope with objects because it's not super fancy.  
I doubt the weather will cooperate though. It's been cloudy for like two weeks straight and we are supposed to be getting like 5 inches of snow on Monday.  |-| 
|-| co1239h || 9 || Well technically you can say that everything on Earth is the way it is because of the physics of dying stars. |-| 
|-| co13tjj || 5 || The biggest reason we haven't colonized other planets is they are not capable on their own of sustaining life.  All the resources would have to come from earth.  Since we don't exactly have an overabundance of resources here, it doesn't seem like the best idea to ship them off somewhere else. |-|

|-| co0mirh || 6 || &gt;Non space/intelligent person, here. Just curious about a few things...

&gt;* In the vacuum of space, is there any perpetual resistance or drag?

Not really. At least not enough to worry about. It is as close to a vacuum as it gets.

&gt;Given enough power while in the vacuum of space, could a man-made device reach the speed of light or close to it? If so, how feasible is it?
 
No. Because the closer an object gets to the speed of light the more energy is required move it. To reach the speed of light requires infinite energy.

&gt;How do we transfer data through space currently (e.g. mars rover)?

[The deep space network.](https://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/dsn.html)

&gt;What are the current/potential throughputs, bandwidth, and more importantly range we can achieve? 
 
I don't know for sure, other than the fact that we're still receiving data from a Voyager probe which is outside the solar system.

&gt;How does the Hubble telescope capture such clear pictures with such long exposures collecting light while moving? 

It's not moving much at all relative to the distance of the subjects it is imaging.

&gt;How does NASA retrieve that data? 

No idea.


 |-| 
|-| co0ylin || 4 || I found some data rate information.

Each Voyager records 48 seconds of high rate (115.2 kbps) data once a week and once every 6 months its sent to Earth. It requires the 70 meter DSN support for data capture, I couldn't find information on how long it takes to transmit the data though.

Cassini has a Peak Data Rate (current best estimate) of 365.568 kbps

Mars Global Surveyor has a minimum downlink rate of 21.33 kbps, 2 kbps engineering data downlink, and 10 bps emergency downlink.

Curiosity (the rover) uplinks to a satellite and then they send the data on - "Curiosity and each orbiter may reach 2 Mbit/s and 256 kbit/s, respectively, but each orbiter is only able to communicate with Curiosity for about eight minutes per day." Between 100 and 250 megabits of data can be transmitted to an orbiter.

Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter can transmit data to Earth at rates as high as 6 megabits per second

Mars Express can transmit data up to 230 kbps

|-| cobsubd || 10 || Whenever life gets you down, Mrs. Brown

And you think you've had enough

And people are stupid, obnoxious and daft

And you fell you've had quite enough

Just remember you're on a planet that's evolving

and revolving at nine hundred miles an hour

That's orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckoned

A sun that is the source of all our power

The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see

Are moving at a million miles a day

In an outer spiral arm, at forty thousand miles an hour

Of the galaxy we call the Milky Way

Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars

It's a hundred thousand light years side to side

It bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand light years thick

But out by us, it's just three thousand light years wide

We're thirty thousand light years from galactic central point

We go 'round every two hundred million years

And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions

In this amazing and expanding universe

The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding

In all of the directions it can whizz

As fast as it can go at the speed of light, you know 

Twelve million miles a minute (and that's the fastest speed there is)

So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure

How amazingly unlikely is your birth

And hope that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space

Because there's bugger all down here on Earth. |-|

|-| cobmj4t || 3 || That image isn't accurate.  The milky way is in a super cluster of galaxies the scale of which is not accurate in the least in this gif. |-| 
|-| cobodqp || 5 || No matter what you say to me. I will never believe a person when they say "i can comprehend this scale"... 

No matter how many pictures I've seen, videos of scale I've watched, just comparisons between our own little planets...

It's just impossible to fathom the scale in which the universe measures.

You look at yourself right now. Most likely sitting in a room. In that room you are still to some degree a small area of the room. That room is probably a small, or even large area of that building. That building is a tiny, tiny area of the city you live in. That city is truly tiny on the scale of the country you're in. Then that country in of itself pretty small on scale of this planet.

Now to me at least, I find it hard to even imagine my size compared to this planet (which I do waaay to much). 

Now sure, if you use something like the planets in our solar system, the moons they have. Yes, you can put them up beside our moon and get some  understanding of how small we are. 

(Let me just add something in here) You look at the moon at night and think to some relative degree that it is close.. But it's really not. You can fit every planet in our system between us and the moon... Just try picture that after looking at a few scales. 

But if you try to tell me you understand how big the Horsehead Nebula is or how big our galaxy is... I just can't believe you.

TL;DR I don't believe the human race will ever truly understand the scale of the universe or fathom the size at which it works. |-|

Controls, switches and displays for piloting the spacecraft and for monitoring and controlling the performance of all systems were located on various panels located inside the crew compartment, with the main panel measuring approximately 7 feet long and 3 feet high.

|-| cobewh7 || 3 || I'm not sure who wrote the article, but it was based on the paper:  *Paradoxes of cosmological physics in the beginning of the 21-st century* by Yurij Baryshev at Sant Petersburg University. Baryshev wrote the book:  *Discovery of Cosmic Fractals*, where his hypothesis is the universe is fractal in nature not homogenous like relativity and Hubbel's law says it should be. I would guess Baryshev has a stake in these paradoxes. 

 |-| 
|-| cobaldm || 8 || In my opinion, it isn't a question of if humans travel to other stars, it's a question of when.

Spaceflight is obviously a difficult and expensive task, but humans have a kind of knack for overcoming these kinds of issues. In nearly 60 years of direct space exploration (not counting the millenia spent chrating the locations of stars, constellations, lunar cycles, the position of planetary objects, Earth's orbit, etc), we have learned tons from both manned and unmanned craft, not to mention that we are far better at launching objects into space using rockets then we were in the early days.

There are multiple proposed methods of reaching other stars, ranging from some solid proposals based on established science (such as solar sails and ion drives) to proposals a bit more crazy yet still in some realm of feasibility (laser sails, antimatter rockets, various nuclear engines), and borderline insane proposals that nobody expects soon, if ever (wormholes and/or warp drives).

As far as getting humans there, there are several proposals in that arena, many of which seem to be making progress so far (embryo seed, suspended animation, life extension, ship going at relativistic speeds, digitizing consciousness into a main computer, and the good old fashioned generation ship).

No matter the method, or even how long it takes humans to get to the point where they can send men or machines to another star, there is little chance that humans will simply shrug their shoulders at the edge of the solar system and say "why go out there when its better here?" |-|

Yes, the climate does change.

Nothing the Alarmist was predicting 10 years ago has happened. It is impossible to link mans activity with climate change.  This guy is only playing your emotions.
