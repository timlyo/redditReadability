I'm a bit of an econ/history nut and I listen to this podcast whenever it comes out, and was very excited to find out that Monopoly was originally TWO contrasting games: one the way we know it now (where you accumulate wealth and put the other players into bankruptcy) and one was more cooperative. The cooperative one was meant to illustrate the awesomeness of the Land Value Tax (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax).

Perhaps obviously in retrospect (?) the monopoly version was way more fun to play.

Wikipedia's treatment of the history of monopoly (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_board_game_Monopoly) is also fun, but the podcast does a great job of telling the story. |-|

|-| cnvjmb0 || 12 || I'd like to open with a quip of a post I made in [this recent thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2qectj/american_revolution_when_the_red_coats_intially/cn5g6cb) on /r/AskHistorians:

&gt; Basically it is argued (and is commonly held in thought to this day) that by very virtue of an absolutist Europe armies were strictly regimented and drilled. Ewald would say 

&gt;&gt;*"The permanent military establishment proved an expensive but indispensable component of absolutist rule. In domestic policies it served as a means to bind the nobility to the state. . .In foreign policy it formed a readily available instrument for power politics. . .It's ranked and file, however, lacked a feeling of loyalty to the state or dynasty. Levied from among the lowest social classes, forced into military service. . .the standing armies of Europe. . .were held together by brutal force and blind drill. Too great of an investment to be risked lightly in battle and liable to desert at any moment, they were most efficient in a pitched battle over open ground, where superior drill, volume of fire, and sheer numbers decided the outcome of battles. Any kind of individual action was almost impossible with such. . .troops."*^1

&gt; So in some sense, yes, musket based warfare was born with an abhorrence to skirmishing based tactics. However it was not out of 'cowardice' or 'a new kind of enemy' that they did not forsee but out of necessity. The standing army provided a means to force the nobility to share fate and allegiance with 'the state' but also created a system where the 'rank and file' had to be brutally suppressed and drilled and could not be allowed to just let off on their own. 

&gt; So the very basis of why absolutist warfare existed along with its application (at least in Western/Central Europe) did not allow an irregular force to develop independently. This is also because "Little War" as it was commonly called required highly trained and motivated officers as it was a 'continuous war' and was a strictly tactical field. It was not an attractive field. *"Continually in action yet only supportive in function, outside the support structures and promotion criteria, unconventional in actions and dissolved at the conclusion of peace"*^2 -- noble officers did not want any part of this since it held no glory or advancement like the 'regular' army until much later.

So really 'skirmishing tactics' as a whole, including 'longbow special forces', were just frankly not possible under what is generally ascribed to 'absolutist armies' because of their inherent structure. Saying "why didn't they have longbow commandos" just outright ignores the social conditions around why armies existed and how they were used in the 17th - 18th centuries. It's 'rivet counting' -- trying to apply 'stats' to determine their usefulness and not socio-economic reasons which are far more prevalent. 

Now, for your points:

------

&gt;  It's certainly a strong advantage, and may explain why muskets became so dominant, yet it comes nowhere close to explaining why weapons that were supposedly more powerful would be driven completely to extinction. 

Because bows were not more powerful; not even the infamous longbow. The English Longbow was an outlier of effectiveness but we can use it in the 'best case' scenario. With a 150 pound draw using a 905 grain arrowtip firing at about 250 ft/s that generates about 127 ft/lb's of energy with a firing distance of ~200 meters. A .69 and .75 caliber smoothbore musket can, with a 220 grain load, for the cost of half the range, achieve a muzzle velocity of ~1100ft/s and a kinetic impact of ~900ft/lb's. As in, a gun gets to the target effectively instantly and penetrates just about every single thing they're wearing. Into the 15th century armor has already advanced enough that even the longbow's tips can not penetrate even a direct, dead on hit though and even back into the crusades the regular bows that everyone else used were bouncing off of armor and being perfectly absorbed by padding. In other words when an arrow hit someone it might kill them; when a bullet hits someone it will kill them.

You're also completely glossing over training. Bows required years of training to become mildly proficient at; even if we're just talking about 'volley fire' they required arm strength and training to use to a significant way. I mean the Longbow is the commonly cited example and it had a 150 pound draw weight up to 185 pound draw. It frankly required a certain level of physical aptitude to use a bow. A gun required none of that, anyone could use a gun. Further a gun required, at most, 1-2 weeks to train a man to use. It didn't require years of training and physical aptitude it required pointing at the enemy and pressing a button. There's a reason England was the only place who used the longbow -- it required significant training from everyone and even then was pretty phased out going into the 15th/16th centuries. 

Further we have morale: Being shot by a musket is *fucking terrifying*. They blow out ear drums, they produce a crap ton of smoke, and they penetrate just about everything coming your way. Now that's just one -- imagine 100, or 200. All coming at once with all the smoke and sound. Bows produced a similar effect from volley fire but nothing like the boom and the smoke of a musket and that can't be ignored. Dave Grossman's On Killing talks about this specifically and points to it being the crucible point to why, despite being 'technically' less accurate and having less range than bows early muskets took over. 

&gt; why wouldn't armies retain elite companies of longbowmen to use as skirmishers or to devastate a weak point in the enemy line with arrows?

Because they couldn't protect themselves and would generally be useless on the early-modern and modern battlefield. I don't know how you expect longbowmen, with all that draw and equipment, to 'act as skirmishers' aka fast moving screeners...they stood behind the line and unleashed volleys not skirmished with the enemy. Longbows aren't used to skirmish...if there's a 'weak point' in the enemy line it's preferable to either send in cavalry or a musket column with bayonets lowered to crush them anyways as that's a decisive actor while skirmishers ("skirmishers"...) are an attritional actor. 

**Let me pose you this question: Why would you rather have 500 longbowmen instead of 500 musketmen, precisely?** Those 500 musketmen can fend off a cavalry attack, can charge into an enemy position and drive them from it, can stand back and fire upon an enemy, can break into loose formation and skirmish, can crush a faltering enemy, and can defend a position reasonably well. What can a bowman do? They can't charge a position, can't defend themselves from cavalry, can't defend a position (because bayonets will drive them from it), but they can shoot 50 yards further and 6 rounds a minute instead of 4? What? Why would *anyone* do this? Warfare in the early modern and modern era isn't about the best K:D ratio it's about making them break and run first -- bows are shit at that compared to muskets, bayonet charges, and cavalry.

&gt; To use the 20th century as an example it would be completely impractical to give every single soldier commando training, yet special forces and elite troops still exist. 

...Who use the exact same weapons. The difference is, in the general, intensity of training not equipment.

&gt; Similarly it would be completely impractical to give every single soldier a rocket launcher or a tank, yet those weapons were still used. 

Similarly cannons, carbines, muskets, rifles, pistols, sabres, pikes, swords, and mortars were used. Just like light, heavy, and medium cavalry was still used.

&gt; This is true even going back to the napoleonic era. Armies did include stronger, better trained troops such as grenadiers, sharpshooters or guardsmen. And they continued to make heavy use of horses even though cavalry were undoubtedly more expensive and more difficult to train than footsoldiers.

Grenadiers were no different from regular infantrymen in any way other than their dress and their experience, same thing for guardsmen. Sharpshooters also used precisely the same weapons as everyone else; at least for the French and largely the British and Prussians as well. 

Cavalry was used as it was a necessary decisive actor -- something was needed to crush the enemy after immediate defeat or to break their center line and that was heavy cavalry. Bows, especially as you suggest a 'small continent' of them as 'special forces' could not act in such a decisive and important way. What could a bow do that a gun couldn't, really? Fire marginally faster and shoot marginally further? That's about it but they did not penetrate armor, they did not allow versatility as acting as a pike and a gun, did not have interchangeable parts, took over half a decade to produce, and took a decade+ to train to use in any proficient way (especially in a 'special forces' kind of way...); those men would just be better served in their own line.  

&gt; wouldn't steel breastplates continue to be given to shock troopers such as grenadiers, or at the very least be given to officers to prevent a stray bullet from wrecking the chain of command?

Breatplates at best protected against pistols which were only used by officers or *caracoles*, light cavalry screeners. It would do nothing against a bayonet or a musketball...the things grenadiers would be charging into as the elite troopers they were. All it would serve to do is slow down a group of people who are supposed to be fast moving. Officers did occasionally use armor as did cavalrymen but generally if you're marching around all day in highly mobile formations the officer getting tired the fastest and not being able to keep up is a major issue.
 |-| 
|-| cnvvb4z || 3 || The amount of training it takes to shoot a bow is exaggerated. I can give a couple of personal examples to support this point:

I can shoot a simple bow i.e. not a modern compound bow and with no aiming devices and hit a target about the size of a man's torso from about 70m away. I rarely practice shooting, just whenever the mood hits me, I shoot a little bit. Except for the class in the following example, I have never shot regularly.

The second example is from an archery class I took because I needed an elective credit on college. We used simple bows in the beginning and fancy modern compounds at the end of the course. The teacher asked how many people had shot before at the start of the class and about half of the class had so half had not. The class was once or twice a week and after a couple months everyone could hit a round target 1m across from about 30 or 40m away, except for one guy. I don't know what was wrong with him but he managed to hit everything but his target.

Armor in the 16th century was very strong and a well made breast plate could withstand a shot from a musket. Shooting a breast plate with a musket would leave a dent in it which was known as proofing the armor (proving it could protect you from fire). Here is a picture of such a breastplate: https://www.google.com/search?site=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955&amp;q=proofed+breastplate&amp;oq=proofed+breastplate&amp;gs_l=img.3...1278.9824.0.10005.27.16.4.7.1.0.95.1349.16.16.0.msedr...0...1ac.1.61.img..8.19.1202.dE_kj_2rdyY#imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=8ppy_PkmlaTt5M%253A%3BfQ-6sV9BeLPhTM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.garthvincent.com%252Fthumb%252FphpThumb.php%253Fsrc%253D..%252Fimages%252Fproduct%252F1407358674x1.jpg%2526w%253D890%2526h%253D662%2526zc%253D1%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.garthvincent.com%252Fantique%252F1521%252Fa%252Bsiege%252Bweight%252Bbreastplate%252B%252F%3B890%3B662
With breastplates so well made in the 16th c. that they can stop a musketball, it isn't unreasonable to assume that there were breastplates that could stop arrows on the 14th and 15th centuries.

There was even an episode of Mythbusters where they busted the myth of the Battle of Agincourt, saying that the English longbowmen didn't win the battle because their bows punched holes in the French knights' armor but because of the weather. The ground was muddy and neither hooves nor armored boots are porous, therefore the French got stuck in the mud while the English did not. Unfortunately, I have never been able to find that episode online. They even did a test where they shot an arrow at a breastplate and it didn't even pierce it.

TL;DR: The amount of training it takes to use a longbow and the power of a longbow have been exaggerated. |-|

It is one of those moments in history with huge implications. Prior to the Seljuk Turks moving into Anatolia, the Byzantine Empire was holding its ground or even pushing back against the Arabs. Without the Turks, the Byzantines probably would not have collapsed. Further it is less likely that the Crusades would have happened--they were triggered in part due to Alexios Comnenos requesting aid against the Turks. 

Without the Crusades and with the Byzantine Empire intact, the West would probably have had far less interaction with the East in general. Would Europe have stagnated as a result? Plus, without the eventual decline of silk road trade due to tense relations with the Ottomans (who rose up out of the Anatolian Turks years later), would Europeans still have sought out alternative trade routes by sea, which eventually led to European dominance all over the world?

Most of it is just crazy speculation, I know, but it is one of those keystone events in history which could have changed the world dramatically if it had gone another way. |-|

Not everywhere has that ability.

Salt is one of the few minerals we have to actively seek out to live.  Additionally, salt is very useful for the preservation of food prior to refrigeration and bacteria killing chemicals and pasteurization (at the time they knew nothing about bacteria), additionally, salt generally makes the flavor of food more palatable and taste better, which along with another valuable commodity, spices, helped improve the taste of food, especially because sometimes food was a little "past due" where flavor enhancers can make it edible.

So salt was traded like anything else of value and had its value where it couldn't be easily gotten. |-|

|-| co0yqn0 || 205 || I majored in History and now struggle to find work.  I currently live in China and teach.  It has been two years and I regret the History degree.  History is easy enough to learn about just by reading.  If you want to learn more just take some classes as an elective but if I could do it again I would look to get a major in a more employable field and find the best internship possible.  Now I consider applying the skills from the degree to a job that is more employable. The skills that are arguably employable from this degree would be research skills, writing skills, oration and such. This doesn't leave many fields for working and since I didn't take an internship that set me up to cross fields the position I am in is even harder.  I truly and humbly suggest, if your intention is anything other than teaching, or being a historian to transfer majors to something different.  If you like reading and writing maybe something within reporting or editing might fit similarly.  Even poly-sci may be a better approach.  Depending on your grades and attitude Law school can be an option from both history and poly-sci but the competition is intense and the work more so.  

Hope this helps. Actually reading your post again I was very similar in that attitude, not knowing what I wanted to do but loving history.  Read books for history and get a degree in something else.  I am 26 now.  Message me if you wanna talk more about it.  I wish I could do college over and now will be forced to make decisions I should have made years ago.    |-| 
|-| co0vr36 || 46 || History major. Got my teaching license at the same time, taught high school after I graduated, enlisted in the Marine Corps, now working in a position normally reserved for engineers while I apply to grad school. So having a degree in history doesn't necessary limit you.

|-| co0youp || 102 || History/Political Science dual degree here. History was so useful for teaching me how to grasp the "big picture" events and important trends and concepts as well as the critical details. It also taught me how to evaluate evidence and use evidence to inform my decision making and thinking. Finally, it taught me how to ask the right questions and how to help inform the questions I do ask with the events and experiences of the past. Studying history is a great way to expand your scholastic abilities. Moreover your skills can be applied in a multiplicity of scenarios/positions. 

What many other redditors have pointed out however is that "history jobs" are really not in high demand. With that said if you get the right professional and research experiences (which do exist) then you can easily enter into the fields of policy or professional research for example. It's all about how well you can demonstrate to employers that you have what it takes to solve problems, condense and explain lots of information easily, and communicate your findings with others. 

You shouldn't however do history as a major and expect to jump right into museum curating. That kind of job takes professional certifications beyond a B.A. You also shouldn't take history as a major if you are not interested in applying the skills you will learn in a variety of positions not just in the "history field" because there are limited opportunities in those professions.  |-|

|-| co0zshf || 26 || I recently graduated with a history degree, and I personally do regret it.

The reasons I regret my history degree:

I found out, while studying history from an academic perspective, that I really only like reading history. I do not enjoy studying it on an academic level. I have always been more interested in the sciences, but I was scared of the math (due to a bad calculus teacher), and so I chose to pursue something that I thought I enjoyed, only to find out that it frustrated the hell out of me to never have a solid, verifiable answer to historical questions. Sadly, my university didn't offer anthropology, archaeology or any of the history-related sciences, otherwise I would have melded my two interests and probably been more satisfied. 

Obviously, my experience may be entirely different from yours and you may enjoy the open-endedness of the academic study of history. I did not. 
Some things to keep in mind: depending on the university you attend and your financial aid status, you are going to be in debt when you graduate and potentially in a LOT of debt. This is true whether you major in history or not. In a lot of ways, a college education is an investment. It is possible to make a bad investment, but it can REALLY pay off if you do things right. If you plan on pursuing a graduate degree to go onto academia, then don't listen to your friend. If you really want to get your undergrad, get out, and make a decent amount of money, I would recommend shooting for a degree in a high-demand field (STEM and IT fields especially, but only if you have interest in them). 

I certainly do not want to discourage you from pursuing a history degree if you have a passion for it. Just keep in mind, that I thought I had a passion for history until I found out what the academic study of history is really like. Perhaps my university had a poor history department, or perhaps it just wasn't for me. Just keep in mind that while college is a great chance to explore new things, gain some experiences you could never have otherwise, and to pursue your dreams, it is also expensive and time consuming. It all depends on your outlook: do you want to take 3-5 years off from the real world, immerse yourself in new experiences, and hope for some good luck in landing a good-paying job? Or do you want to spend that time pursuing a marketable knowledge and skill set that can easily earn gainful employment? Obviously, some people get lucky and they find both, but based on what I have seen it is not anywhere near the majority. Just think long and hard about your future. Whichever way you choose to go: get involved on campus! Go to your professor's office hours, talk to them after class, join or start student groups, network! I made the mistake of thinking my degree was enough.

I am currently delivering pizzas and searching for a better job, but there definitely weren't any recruiters hunting for history majors at my university's job fairs.  |-| 
|-| co0ynsw || 36 || Honestly, I think your undergrad degree matters less (unless you're going into a field that requires a lot of specific knowledge like medicine or law). You can get an undergrad in history and get plenty of normal business jobs, the  Bachelor's degree is more about proving you are dedicated and have a well rounded amount of knowledge. Plus, history gives you good research and writing skills, which are valuable for a lot of jobs. 

Worry about choice more if you go to grad school, but a history undergrad is much more versatile than a lot of people say it is. |-| 
|-| co0xbka || 92 || Major in something that will get you a job.  MINOR in something that interests you (if you're not happy with the job prospects for that particular field). |-| 
|-| co0zu0b || 23 || /sigh. I suppose I should tell you my story.

I majored in history. Also got a minor in anthropology while I was at it, but that's beside the point. Much like you I was very much interested in this field, but at the same time I realized that it would not pay the bills. The solution to the problem, at least the one I've found, was to separate my studies from my career.

Here is how I did it. While in high school I began studying everything computer-related. Programming, networking, etc. This way I was able to afford a pleasant life for myself and also the higher education I wanted. You could say I went to the university as a hobby, while having a career in computers. This arrangement was anything but easy, but in the end I got a degree from a prestigious university (top 12 in the US, top 24 in the world) while still being able to live in a nice condo, travel, have cool gadgets, a new car, etc.

Naturally this took a lot longer that 4 years because I worked full time and went to school at night. That said, I graduated with only $10K in loans. For comparison my school is said to cost about $50K a year. Two years later I paid them off. At that point I had enough experience and enough connections to change careers. Right now I work in creative capacity within the video gaming industry. History helps quite a bit when I make stuff up. But so does understanding computers and programming even though I no longer do that.

Edit: If you plan on being a teacher, as some here have suggested, consider this: there are A LOT more hungry history majors than there are vacancies. Chances are you'll end up in some corporate job that will drain your soul or you will be making coffee in Starbucks.

TL:DR — you can study history if you can find a separate way to make money. Then you might get a job where history would help. If you want to be an actual historian, prepare to live and die in poverty, unless some miracle happens. Unless you have a solid plan (not a dream, a plan) don't do this to yourself.

|-| co0z8ri || 15 || Your friend is not right. A major in history is not a waste of time. Law is a natural place to go with a history major, but I also personally know three doctors who are history majors. History provides its students with excellent analytical skills, and it teaches you how to process and organize information, skills vital in any profession. The way the job market is organized today is that majors in the humanities and social sciences generally have an equal chance of getting an intro-level position that does not require specific scientific or technical knowledge. Higher and better positions typically require further education, like a Masters. This is why you should do something that you are good at, as a high GPA will get you farther than your choice of major. |-| 
|-| co11tql || 10 || You can do whatever the fuck you want with a history degree. 

i was a history/poli sci dual major. I graduated two years ago and I received a bunch of job offers in combative markets (NYC/DC/Philly) in fields ranging from political think tanks, to marketing/sales, to paralegal work.*

**My two cents:** if you don't study something technical (engineering, comp sci, etc), you can get a job doing *anything* other than STEM work. You want to move to california to get a job as, idk, an intern at the San Fransico 49ers? Do it. Market yourself well, work harder than your colleagues, and work your way up. That is how everybody else does it anyway. You want to move to Mississippi and start a BBQ joint? Do it. Market yourself well, work harder than your colleagues, and work your way up. 

You can do anything you want with a history degree—or any liberal arts degree—as long as you can convince people that you can somehow make them more money or make them happier or both. 

If you want to study history, study history. Just know that the end game is getting a job. As such, you should be spending more time improving skills—interviewing, networking, internships, marketable skills—than studying history for anything other than GPA maintenance. In terms of marketable skills, took an Microsoft Excel "work shop," which was bull shit and I could have learned everything from Google, just to substantiate a claim on my resume that says I know Excel. Excel is marketable. 

Get fit. People tend to look at those who are in shape (and not meathead-ish) as more responsible. Get some suits, learn to look people in the eye, read books about everything and make yourself be the best history major out there. People will line up to hire you in any field (excluding STEM stuff). 

And a little piece of advice: when you start getting interviews you might get a little nervous. Just remember that nobody wants to waste their time. Nobody says, "Yeah we're going to bring this dumb-ass history major in just to ask him questions and waste his and our time." When you get interview opportunities, remember that, at that point, you're already qualified and they're just checking for personality matches (i.e. "can i work with this kid for 40 hours a week?").

It doesn't matter about your degree as a liberal arts major. You just need to be more employable than other liberal arts majors.  

Cheers and good luck.

|-| co0z3go || 8 || Here's what I learned from studying history:

-You must be able to think vertically (potentially infinite and complex concurrent events) and horizontally (...over a discrete or open-ended timeframe).

-You must be able to conduct critical analysis to separate signal from noise, thereby establishing connections between seemingly unrelated events.

-You must create mental frameworks for understanding iterative and recursive progressions, and be able to modify these to fit endless variations.

-You must be able to identify, rationalize, and communicate to others a clear narrative of events over time. 

As for me and what history has meant for me professionally: I have worked only in technology - with some of the largest corporations, financial institutions, and governments in the world - with the roles of (a) understanding how complex, interdependent systems operate, (b) explaining how technology can facilitate interoperability, and (c) convincing institutions why the technology is critical.

Round-up: Think about history less in terms of 'what you know' and more in terms of 'how you know'. In other words, don't try to remember everything you've learned so you can play it back to someone else. Instead, find the best way to understand and communicate complex ideas - no matter the content. 

Also, you can learn some really cool stories. |-|

Please, please, please don't make my mistake and focus solely on a major that basically prepares you to write a book that nobody will buy or teach a class that nobody enjoys.

|-| co119dw || 10 || I tend to disagree with a lot of people who tend to recommend "practical degrees". My advice is to study whatever is gonna interest you intellectually the most. You're gonna be spending 4 years engrossed in it, doing research, studying, writing, and ultimately writing a senior thesis. If you study a field you're not as passionate about it won't hold your interest as much and your academic performance might suffer for it, and you won't get all the rewards that come from a college education in any subject.

My advice is this: 

* if you're interested in history, major in it. Then go talk to your professors, just to see what their own personal stories were, what they did in school, etc. 
* Go to the career center on campus, tell them you're a history major and ask them what kinds of *history related* jobs tend to be out there for history majors. Keeping in mind, there are plenty of other jobs you can get without a history degree (I've worked in broadcasting and journalism, and I never took one class in either subject for instance).  Keep the careers and jobs they mention in the back of your mind as you go through your classes. Do you really want to be a professor? Do you want to work as an archivist? Do you want to work for a think tank? Etc., etc.

* While you're doing this, for the first couple of years of school, sign up for any activity on campus that even remotely matches your interests. Campus radio? Check it out. Political clubs? Attend a meeting. Jobs available putting on programming in the student center? Try it out. There are so many things available to you on campus in college that you can never get anywhere else. They are free, and accessible with no requirement of prior knowledge. Not only are they a great way to meet people, and great for any resume, but more importantly to your concerns, they give you valuable exposure to many other potential fields that you don't get to have on your own. So let's say you have an epiphany that history isn't your thing but it's too late to change majors, at least you're deeply involved in things that interest you and maybe you can build experience with those to get you jobs after school....SIDE NOTE: my advice is to sign up for as many clubs and activities as possible. As your academic workload and life responsibilities build up, take that same freedom to quit clubs and size down and focus on things that you are most interested in.

* After a couple of years, maybe you have some vague concept of a job you would like to have, or a field you would like to be in, or a company you would like to work for. Maybe its history related. Maybe its not. Either way, see if there are internships available that you can apply for. This above most other things, even your major I've found, is the primary thing employers will look for. (If you end up going into academics, grad school or something, then this will not matter as much). If your new chosen field is absolutely repulsed by history majors, then this will help balance out your resume.

* If you find you love history so much, and want to go to grad school then don't worry about the job prospects. Your happiness is the most important thing. But focus and prepare. Talk to your professors, plan your process long before graduating. When you'll take standardized tests for admissions, what you would want to research. Maybe use that for  your senior thesis. Reach out to schools and other professors expressing your interest. The same advice applies for any other field with limited prospects. Plan early, and be very proactive. Its competitive, but if your heart and soul is behind it, you're in a good position to succeed.

Good luck, and whatever you do, enjoy it. |-| 
|-| co10tg5 || 4 || Remember the old saying:
Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. George Santayana (16 December 1863 in Madrid, Spain – 26 September 1952 in Rome, Italy)

Your studies are meant to educate you, give you life skills and prepare you for the world.  And you SHOULD follow your heart to a large extent as you will have a happier life.

I agree with those who say that just doing history will not earn you enough but that is no reason to give up history.  Look at areas that intersect with history that also have earnings value and stay at that intersection.

For example you could do Economics &amp; History or Anthropology &amp; History or Management &amp; History or even Finance &amp; History.  If you can do a degree in something like that, you would find that you bring unique perspectives that no one else can bring and that will make you uniquely valuable and relevant.  For example:
* Students of Anthropology have been used very successfully by Nokia to design their phones (that were a smash hit 10 years ago).
* Students of economics are beginning to take a fresh look at the reasons why the various Empires of the past (Roman etc.,) failed.  Learnings from there will help us survive through bad economic times.

In the worst case scenario, keep at it as a hobby and you never know where you'll end up.

All the best. |-|

My liberal arts degree, specifically the argumentative power of history, has made me a success in my town.  Even in a blue collar world, people respond to an education.   |-| 
|-| co0zm8f || 4 || History/PoliSci here. I am so thankful that I studied history. It gives you perspective that most lack. Still, it has never gotten me a job. Actually, I had to go back to undergrad, and am now in PA school at age 40. Do whatever feels right, but go into it with open eyes and realistic expectations. Your history degree will be personally enriching, but professionally useless. 

I think the people encouraging you to double major or get a minor in history make solid points. Frankly, I've been very lucky in my life to never suffer for my choice of studies. It is not that way for everyone.

Good luck, amigo! |-| 
|-| co12bml || 3 || you can read history books your whole life, independently from academia. you can also write historical fiction on your own, watch documentaries, etc. there's very very little real economic demand for historians yet college is increasingly insanely expensive. |-| 
|-| co0zig6 || 3 || I'm a biochemisty major right now. If I could go back, or if I had the money/time, I'd have done a dual major. I suspect that in an alternate universe, I'd be doing a history major right now and being super happy about that. I just love the subject that much, and I think when I grow older, I'll go back to school to get my official BA in History.

That being said, a lot of people don't end up using their own degrees. Just because I'm a biochem major does not inherently mean I'll end up in a laboratory as a primary investigator. So in the end, it depends on what you want to do when you get out of school. I personally want to get into academia, researching genetically modified organisms, and I'll need the BS from my university in order to get into grad school for genetics or molecular biology. If you want to get into academia as a historian, go get your history degree, because they won't accept a minor for that Masters/PhD program. If you want to be a curator at a museum, go get that history major. If you want to teach history, go get that major. Otherwise, honestly, it probably doesn't really matter all that much. One of my friends got a history degree, and is now in a Masters program for Library Sciences. Another friend is getting a history major and hopes to work as a foreign diplomat in the Middle East (he's triple majoring in history, economics, and political science off the top of my head). Another one of my friends has a biochemistry degree and is now pursing law. And another one of my friends dual majored in biochem and history and is now a history professor. 

Good luck! |-|

|-| co0uoqa || 3 || well, odds are 99%+ that you won't do history with your life, but your career doesn't have to depend on your major. for example, if you are super extroverted (e.g., classic frat bro) you might have a great career in sales.
 |-| 
|-| co10aij || 3 || I work with two history majors (who graduated).  They're meatcutters.  Now, on the upside, that degree is an in to management, and the job pays decently.  Downside-  well, they're meatcutters. Not exactly history jobs.   |-| 
|-| co10ns3 || 3 || Pass up the history degree. I have a double major in history and political science. It was a gigantic waste of money. A few years after getting my history degree, I went back to school for speech and hearing science in preparation for a degree in speech-language pathology. Now I make $35 an hour and get job offers all of the time. 

Do something you can cultivate a career in. |-|

|-| co097py || 5 || Check this out: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_colonization_of_the_Americas |-| 
|-| co0e4dn || 8 || The HRE (Holy Roman Empire) had very little influence on the start of the age of discovery, mainly because the emperors at that time thought the New World was worthless. Maximilian I (1486-1519) had no interest in it. His successor, Charles V (1519-1556) was the ruler of the HRE when it was at it's greatest extent, which made him be too busy with Central/Western European affairs to deal with the New World, even though he was the Spanish Emperor. Some say Charles V's lack of action is responsible for Portugal's quick expansion in South America. It wasn't untill Joseph I's (1690-1711) reign that the Empire really started having interests in the Americas, spearheaded by the Hanseatic League, who was seeking more trade opportunities to compete with the recently formed United Netherlands (later known as the Kingdom of Holland), but by then it had become very difficult to gain relevant lands in Central America, since South and North America had been pretty much entirely taken by this point. |-| 
|-| co0kver || 4 || Unless you are doing a very broad paper your professor will likely tell you including all of those topics is far too large. Something including all of those topics could be several books long. It is also good to keep in mind Ancient Greece is itself an oversimplification, when it is talked about most of the time it is actual referencing the city-state of Athens. Greece was for a long time a loose conglomeration of city-states with very different cultures. Rome on the other hand was a much more cohesive single empire.  
Both have fascinating topics in regards to how they affect the world today. Looking at philosophy, Athens can provide a great setting, though the reading will likely be large and rather dense. Looking at a legal system, I personally think the Roman empire provides a more interesting research topic. As the development of separate classes and how they were treated is cool and directly affected the creation of the feudal system in the middle ages.  
Edit: some grammar and spelling fixes.

|-| co0nrjd || 3 || I would go to Acre around the 1180s. Wake up on a sunny day in the Levant, put on my maille and go watch my peasants in the field.   
 Language wouldn't be a problem, I'm fluent in French and Italian, old french isn't too different from what it is today.

Later on in the day me and my Knights would ride south to Haifa and look for a skirmish with some Muslim bandits. 

If I could stop something it would be barborossa's death during the 3rd crusade. If he had made it to the levant the entire campaign would've gone differently. Jerusalem might've even been recaptured. Richard the lionheart couldn't siege the city

Some of the comments in this article are absolutely heart breaking but there's one that gives me hope. "By the time we reach the 75th anniversary, there may be almost no survivors left.

|-| cobj5m0 || 3 || I'm very interested in the period too. Unfortunately, I've only been able to find one podcast so far:

[Renaissance English History Podcast](http://englandcast.blogspot.com/)

I'm only a few episodes in - it's interesting and I'm enjoying it, but it's nowhere near Dan Carlin levels. Still worth a listen, IMO. |-| 
|-| cob5f6x || 10 || Anything with Buzzfeed's name attached to it needs to be examined with a grain of salt. They don't exactly make much effort to hide the fact that they like to revise history and push radical progressive attitudes. The body types depicted compared to the classical images in the backdrop don't actually match up. And I *really* wish people would put the, "BUT I'M WEARING THE SIZE MARILIN MONROE WORE!" demon to church. Dress sizes were held to a different scale back then. Even today what we understand as "obese" is different, even in a clinical sense. 


And it is worth pointing out that for many of these cultures had an entirely different problem than what we face today in western society- we have to worry about eating too much, they had to worry about too little. Fat as a symbol 1000 years ago was completely different than what it means today. 


And it is a bit racist to shove cultures under the rug. They want to have you believe that once you get past 200 AD or so everything was about a bunch of Europeans. I can understand that Ancient Greece was supplanted in the public consciousness of Europe in favor of, say, Victorian England, but Asia? The entire continent? Han Dynasty ends and suddenly they don't think anything?  |-| 
|-| coazng3 || 3 || I wonder who decided how an ideal female should look like? Were women trying to be fat or skinny according to the time and location they were living in?I doubt that at one point in this world, being really overweight was ever attractive or ideal, regardless of the gender. 
 |-| 
|-| cob41gs || 3 || These types of 'reports' are interesting but I don't know how I feel about the focus on female beauty standards. There also have been male ideals throughout the ages. Why can't such portraits exist side by side? It's probably fair to assess that healthy = beautiful as a general guideline? |-| 
|-| cob8fhj || 3 || Wait a minute - Italian Renaissance, c. 1400... 1700s?! |-| 
|-| cob0n73 || 3 || My problem with this is that is completely ignores environmental, geographical and anthropological details. history isn't a one size fits all (hmmm that's a good pun...) 

someone living in arctic conditions would die if they were skinny and meager, communities in Africa today believe being on the larger heavier side represents wealth (because they can afford food.) etc. |-|

Just a quick reminder regarding rule 2:

**No politics or soapboxing.**

* Submissions that are overtly political will be removed; political topics are only acceptable if discussed in a historical context. Comments should discuss a historical topic, not advocate an agenda. This is entirely at the moderators' discretion and violators will be fed to the bear.

In /r/history we like to discuss history in an accessible and informative manner, and are of course open to discussion of topics such as this one. 

We have observed that off topic comments serve only to derail conversation and turn threads into cesspits. 

With this in mind, please be aware that /r/history does not allow politics, soapboxing, or off-topic comments. This policy is not meant to in any way stifle intelligent discussion about these topics, but merely to keep the focus of /r/history on history. There are plenty of spaces on reddit that you can post about politics, modern society and current trends, but this is not one of them.

If you have questions or concerns about this policy, [please direct them to modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fhistory&amp;subject=I have a question about soapboxing) rather than replying here. |-|

|-| coazwqb || 3 || There is no evidence for the infallibility of the bible. As I said in a comment on that thread (and wow, is that guy up his own ass), it is abundantly clear that the bible is a collection of fables and cultural stories passed down and collected into one work over centuries of time, and only after that given its "holy" status. That guy was a bullshitter through and through, and theres no need for you to waste your time trying to change his mind, he's already showed that he wont do that. |-|
