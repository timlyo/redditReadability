|-| cnuzz2d || 19 || Best way to achieve this is to place the eggs in boiling water, not cold water from the beginning. Boil on almost high for 13 minutes, then set the pot away from the heat for 1-2 minutes. Then rinse with cold water for a couple minutes and let him sit in the pot with cold water for 5 minutes. Add ice if you want for bets results.

|-| cnxu1r2 || 5 || Most gas stations only have a regular and a premium tank, mid grade is made on-site by mixing them together 50/50.  So a more sophisticated unit could offer 87,88,89,90,91 grades with just an 87 and 91 base.  93 octane is rare, however, and probably has a dedicated tank at the gas station.  Your car will also make less horsepower and get poorer fuel economy using 93 octane unless there are special circumstances requiring it (high compression, high boost, high rpm, advanced ignition timing, all of the above...)

The reason that they are able to interpolate that particular anitomical protoplasm into this dish is because of US Amendment 334 Section B5 which states as follows: No part of an avian creature shall be subjected to prejudice within the dining halls of America.
This is a very significant Amendment within the United States because it just so happened to be passed in 1948, the same year that the Fixation Clause of Manhattan was introduced into western culture.
During the late 1960s, there was very controversial discussion about wether or not this clause should have been passed and Democrats actually held violent protests within the streets of Bolshetville, Indiana. This caused the entire town to be quarantined from the rest uv the United States as part an executive order passed by Grover Cleveland later that year. Another reason for this action was the secondary holy shit how have you read this far down stance wich was taken up by wow, I just realized how funny of a word "wich" is.

I buy a number of their products, namely Liv 52 (Liver Repair formula). I really wonder if they reformulate some of their products for the US market.  There are likely a number of FDA regulations they have to comply to. I would look into getting it from an out of country source as long as you do your diligence.  |-|

You can adjust the amount of pressure in the bubble to take off whatever percentage of body weight you want.  Its used for gait training for people who can't handle their full body weight when walking or for athletes who need to work on their running mechanics.   |-|

|-| cogbb2i || 14 || Damn inker  |-| 
|-| cogfliw || 28 || I have one with double the black ink! I'll have to check if it's the same page, maybe I got your ink.

Edit: [nope, different book]( http://imgur.com/8hjCF3e) |-| 
|-| cogdaj3 || 361 || In June 1978, almost 40 years to the day of it's original printing; a Superman #1 64 page edition was discovered that also had no black ink. At auction that year the edition fetched $22,000, a paltry sum by today's standards but a record at the time. While Calvin and Hobbes does not have quite the devout following of the well known super hero, I'm certain this copy would fetch a pretty penny at auction. Congrats on the find OP. |-| 
|-| cogg5ef || 9 || I always find misprints in books to be amusing, especially the big mistakes.  Most that I have is a book with the cover attached upside-down, so when I'm reading it, it looks like I'm holding the book upside down.  It's [Blind Descent](http://www.amazon.ca/Blind-Descent-Quest-Discover-Deepest/dp/0307736784), which somehow just makes that extra amusing to me. |-| 
|-| cogbvp6 || 13 || That's awesome! Is he wearing a helmet? |-| 
|-| cogjzgb || 6 || I just realized I haven't read my collection in years. I pawed through the essential calvin and hobbes practically every day when I was a kid. Those comics taught me more things than I ever thought possible. I got funny looks from my parents when I ask them what Karl Marx meant when he said religion was the opiate of the masses and how it related to TV. |-| 
|-| coghxzy || 11 || How has this not been cross posted to /r/creepy ? 

It clearly fits the bill of not even being mildly creepy. |-| 
|-| cogg90m || 6 || You could say that it's missing a key component... |-| 
|-| cogj7rh || 5 || As a former Associate Producer for a reality TV show finding old treasures in lockers and involving the word "WARS" in the title, I would research stuff after it was found like this all the time. Misprints can be potentially worth big money. Especially for popular works. Get it looked at!!!
 |-| 
|-| cogqaqi || 5 || Saw the same kind of before/after on an Adventure Time comic, in the illustrator's blog talking about his process. The watercolors look so blobby, it's amazing how it all comes together with the inking.

|-| cogbo2l || 29 || It actually looks really shitty without the black ink :| |-| 
|-| cogelk4 || 7 || If the entire comic book is like this it might be an editor's copy and might be worth allot depending on how old it is. |-| 
|-| coggyd5 || 5 || **Printer here** : I would assume these cartoons are made in a small printingpress ( like this http://www.daltons-printers.com/uploads/images/speedmaster74.jpg ) 

What happens is that one colour is added to the paper pr tower that you see there, most standard colours are Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black and the last tower can be used for different things like a shiny colour that adds effect or similar stuff.

On some machines the printer has to put one aluminum plate into each tower, the plate that goes into the Cyan tower only absorbs Cyan colour on the designated areas ( We have areas that absorb colour and areas that absorb water in some cases ), the plate that goes into the Magenta tower only absorbs Magenta colour etc

My guess is that the printer ran out of black colour ( not ink, dont ever call it ink :) ) OR that he simply forgot to put the black aluminum plate into the machine and one copy got out by mistake. Its more likely the first option , as he is making thousands of these pr hour its easy to miss out on one bad one if you are not paying attention

Been working as a printer for 12 years now but im only making newspapers, no magazines and cartoons.

Swan neck deformities are basically a hyperextension of your PIP (middle joint in your finger) while your DIP (last joint in your finger) is flexed. They are frequently seen in rheumatoid arthritis and connective tissue disorders (like Ehlers Danlos), but can also be seen after traumatic injury, or some people are just born with it!
It happens when the ligament on the underside of your finger - the one that usually prevents your finger from hyper flexing - weakens. |-|

|-| cofztco || 85 || No, your watch is correct.  The centuries-old convention is to use "IIII" for clocks and watches even though "IV" is used in all other contexts.  I've noticed that many modern clocks seem to get this wrong but your watch is correct.  Without hitting Google, my memory says that some French King was dyslexic and commanded the change so he wouldn't be confused between "IV" and "VI".  I guess "IX" and "XI" were less of a problem for him for some reason or maybe "VIIII" was just too long and/or weird.

Edit:  after some quick checking ... The Louis XIV (irony there) story seems likely to be apocryphal.  Other theories are that clock-makers are just more conservative or that "IIII" gives better symmetry with the "VIII" opposite.  Anyway, the fact remains that the great majority of clocks and watches with Roman numerals use "IIII" instead of "IV". |-| 
|-| cog2etw || 16 || Not wrong at all. Historically IIII has always been used for clock faces. IV is wrong for a timepiece. |-|
