Really cool little movie based on a play - a woman who lost her son some years prior strikes up a relationship with a drifter who claims that he was experimented on by the Army. That drifter is played excellently by Michael Shannon. The climax of this movie absolutely blew me away. It was marketed as a horror movie but the director (William Friedkin) thinks of it as not really belonging to any particular genre, though he also referred to it as a "black comedy love story." |-|

 "I told you, man, the green one's the best" |-| 
|-| cntwcrz || 10 || I like this ending better too, but agree that the last lines are cheesy.

How about this:

*Somerset pulls hammer of his gun*

Somerset: "You know I'm not going to let him win."

*Mills turns away, as if defeated, then spins around to shoot Doe*

*A gunshot is heard. Mills looks down - he's unhurt. Doe looks down - he's been shot by Somerset. Somerset walks over and hands his gun to Mills.*

Somerset: "Now arrest me. . ."*

*Doe looks up in amazement and horror.*

Somerset:". . .  I want it to be the last thing this f****r sees."

(Be gentle, okay? Just throwing this out for fun).

This is why there are so many people clueless today as to what goes on in the world, or in war. Snipers are chosen and trained for their detachment and disregard for nearly all human life. Kyle was like a seven year old in fucking Disneyland with a pocket full of cash, he wasn't sad about killing jack shit.

To make a movie about someone with a hunting dog's depth of a sympathetic worldview while making him an introspective teddy bear is fairly misleading.

People see shit like this and then argue that there is a human side to maniacs like Kyle or some bullshit.

But we get all our information from movies now, so who am I to argue? |-|

|-| cnu2vz8 || 34 || &gt;...and so American Sniper never commits fully to Eastwood's mission or the "USA! USA!" message its detractors mistakenly think the movie is broadcasting.

That's the thing.  There is a certain subset of the American public that were and are happy to read a book by a guy who refers to the people he killed in uniform as "savages" and have no problem with that.  But, this group of people is not nearly large enough to allow Eastwood to make an unapologetic biopic and have it make large amounts of money (not to mention be so controversial as to become an impediment to its success).

A very large swath of the American movie-going public is more than happy to fetishize someone like Kyle, but they cannot so easily do so *guilt-free*.  The dramatic embellishments that are the subject of this article are just the "guilt get out of jail free" cards that the audience needs to eat this kind of film up and still feel good about themselves when they leave the theater.  Kyle is not the bad guy, the horrors of war are, etc., etc.

I don't really mean the above to be judgmental, only observational. |-|

|-| cnu4n4j || 7 || **Attack the Block**
It's an alien invasion story, though with a different motivation than what we typically see. It's also very contained - no global battles or widespread city destruction and mass panic - partly because it's low budget, but the reasoning for the containment is very logical and not forced. Great alien design, has a kind of anime/manga feel to it because of great costuming and characterization. |-| 
|-| cnu4srh || 20 || This sounds amazing. I really like Fukunaga's visual style... Of course, True Detective was really eerie and fascinating, but I watched his adaptation of Jane Eyre recently, and even that is kind of unnerving and creepy.

True Detective was so cool, but I'm glad they're going to focus more on the strange parts of 'It', I think everyone was expecting something a bit more sinister and labyrinthine with True Detective's conclusion... Despite taking place in an actual labyrinth, the end of that story was rather to the point. Two buddy cops take out the big bad, and share a laugh together. Fade to black. I'd love to see Fukunaga get to really flesh out the arcane and the occult a bit more. I kind of wish this was a limited series, instead of a two-part film...

I'm wary of the trend towards gritty reboots, but this is one case where I think it's justified. |-|

Edit: super stoked to see the skills of True Detective onboard. The colors and atmosphere of True Detective will be excellent for the film.  |-|

|-| cnu5z8h || 30 || I think it would be really interesting to see them tackle the elements of the book that weren't really discussed in the t.v version, and elements that are never really mentioned when people talk about the iconic status of the novel. Some of the best parts for me was the development of these characters, king takes time to show that while these horrifying and surreal events are going on around the characters, they still spend time doing normal kid things. Although king sets an unsettling tone with the idea of IT  constantly being in the background, I think it would be great to see the films take this approach, especially since its planned for two movies. They have so much time then to build a sense of dread, instead of out and out shock and horror.  |-|

People keep saying "Oh, the target audience is IT people they fucked this movie up" are full of shit. Same with the people who are ripping it apart because the 'Hero' knows how to use a firearm (hint: it's not hard to pick up how to do that) and know how to defend himself (hint: in prison all you can do really is work out &amp; beat stuff up in your room).

|-| cnu8ub9 || 23 || Mentioned it in another thread that, aside from a small incident with obnoxious teenagers, I enjoyed it.

My girlfriend and I went to see it, and she was going into it blind. She hadn't seen any trailers, so she didn't have any bias from the trailers. We both really enjoyed it. It's a slow burn thriller with some brutal action.

Hemsworth's character can fight, and it seemed like a prison-style type fighting where you're just as fast and brutal as possible to survive. The magazine armor and hidden screwdriver was a cool preparation moment. He can't shoot well at all, and holds a gun for maybe two minutes of screentime.

It's not perfect, but damn, it doesn't deserve the vitriol it gets for a trailer. |-|

Also, I feel like his terrible roles only get mentioned because they are so strange. How is he more offensive than De Niro, who hasn't had a good role is a long time?  |-|

|-| cnuaog0 || 5 || I love Michael Mann but it just felt off. I actually had the opposite reaction to you. Seeing it made me want to rewatch Miami Vice and I actually appreciate the movie way more now. The love story in Blackhat felt forced, the script felt off and it wasn't that exciting. In comparison Miami Vice throws you right into the action and is at least fun even if the characters are never really given time. On top of that the I preferred the cop team dynamic as they felt cohesive as a unit in action scenes. 
Maybe I need to rewatch it but my first time in theatres left me feeling disappointed which saddens me because I really was looking forward to the film. |-|

I saw it completely not knowing what I was seeing as my group walked into the wrong theatre. I have to say, the first opening ten minutes was by far the coolest animation for processors and the physical manifestation of transistors actually moving. However, other than that I thought it was a terrible film. The characters all seemed confusing and just seemed to be screaming buzz words and empty dialog. Having not seen the trailers until after I saw the movie, the plot was basically unfollowable. Why did they target the tin mines, why did they blow up a nuclear reactor, why did the lead and the supporting female lead fall in love after being seen together on screen for five minutes? The whole plot was very hard to follow in general and that's why I have complaints. The visuals were amazing IMO, the action was better than par it's just the plot and dialog was very choppy and full of buzzwords. |-|

Not exactly the type of guy to write an honest, heartfelt autobiography about his issues. If anyone was dishonest, it's more likely Kyle than Eastwood. I mean, there are MANY people who refute Kyle's claims in the book(Jesse Ventura, most famously). Additionally, Kyle's wife helped advise Eastwood and Cooper, so she most likely painted her husband in a different way. Even if he were reluctant to admit that he was struggling, his wife (who loves him) would still be able to pick up on it. 

Obviously, I'm speculating. I didn't know the man. All the discussion surrounding him has been absolutely fascinating to me though. It's been interesting to hear how some praise him while others are disgusted by him. |-|

|-| cnuiadf || 73 || I never read the book nor have I seen the movie (I don't like to watch modern war films for personal reasons) but if he was in Fallujah I &amp; II then that city was definitely 99.999% filled with bad dudes looking for a fight. |-|

|-| cnuiaqk || 6 || I thought it was a great movie.  |-| 
|-| cnuiazr || 5 || Movie was just fantastic. I did not think it was pro war at all, neither was it anti war. The movie was simply just a biopic of an American Hero that put his life on the line to serve his country. I thought the film put enough in there for either side of the argument to be raised up. But at the end it did not take a stance either way. If you want to fault it for that then thats fair but don't go on spewing bullshit like seth rogen. |-|

|-| cnuif86 || 517 || I watched the movie and enjoyed it.  However, what has me upset is that they are glorifying a guy who many not be all he claimed to be because he has quite the history of lying, which I found out afterward when I wanted to find out more about him.  Sorry, but if you are a historical figure, I'm going to Google you!

Finding out that he was such a liar calls into question, for me, all his so-called accomplishments.  I get that those sent off to war have to have the ability to to dehumanize the enemy somewhat but his claim that he had went into New Orleans during Katrina to pick off looters is really troubling and paints him to be a murderous sociopath.  In New Orleans, we're talking about fellow Americans.  If he felt that his role was judge, jury and executioner on American soil, do you really think that he was above picking off unarmed Iraqis??  I sure as hell don't and it is troubling to me that he is being portrayed as hero!
 |-| 
|-| cnuifv4 || 18 || I think this reviewer misunderstood Kyle's portrayed "unease" in the movie. Having seen American Sniper, I never got the impression that Eastwood intended to make Kyle look guilt ridden for killing enemy combatants.

The character says multiple times that he feels badly because he wants to do more. On some level he knows that no matter how many kills he gets, his boys will still get killed. He regrets the men he couldn't save. That's what causes his growing emotional stress. |-|

|-| cnujjg3 || 4 || &gt;I do not understand how /r/movies is so anti-Blackhat. I saw it last night (unlike everyone who is shitting on it here it seems) and I thought it was pretty good, certainly better than the Army commercial that is American Sniper or anything else you can see this month.

And this is where you lost me.  Focus on why you liked the movie, don't bash or talk about anything else.  That is why I down voted you. |-| 
|-| cnujk03 || 36 || &gt;In theory, all the good, non-terrorists had been cleared out of the city, which is why there was no normal Muslims, only radical terrorists and affiliates with those terrorists.

Have not seen the movie, so I won't be commenting on it. However, what you just said here scares me. How could you make an assumption like this about people in any given city? Just because there are people who are attached to their homes and unwilling to leave does not mean you can assign them a convenient label to suit what you think of them. You should not throw accusations that people who decide not to leave their homes are terrorists. 

As I haven't seen the movie for myself, I can't really say much about it. But if this is the kind of thinking that it wants people to have walking out of it, then we're living in some scary times.   |-| 
|-| cnujkg8 || -8 || It was just terribly American, and cringey.

The scene where he's sitting on his couch with his brother was basically what killed it for me, and was a great example of Eastwoods famous "One Take" policy.

"I don't know what I'm doing with my life..."

"What are you talking about? We're Cowboys, we are living the dream!"

TV News comes on with shots of terrorist attack. Bradley Cooper slowly stands with his cowboy hat on and stares at the screen.

"Who's doing this to us?"

Cuts to him signing up for the Military.

Beautifully written scene. Also the fake baby scene was great too. |-|

Classic |-| 
|-| cnujm1k || 46 || Just because the film was kept relatively coherent doesn't preclude it from functioning as propaganda. Ever see Enemy at the Gates? The film would be very different if there were evil Soviets everywhere and some badass german sniper with a wife and a baby saving all of his friend's lives. |-| 
|-| cnujm6z || 17 || I'm not American. I liked the movie, felt it defiantly showed the negative aspects of war, but also had some Merica Fuck Yeah moments as well.  |-|

|-| cnujrfx || 10 || Generally not a fan of comedies; loved this one. Clever &amp; very funny. |-| 
|-| cnujria || 82 || I would never say American Sniper is propaganda, but it definitely has a very one-sided view of the war. For me, it simplifies a very complex and morally ambiguous conflict into a mostly black and white, good guys vs. bad guys telling of the story. A few scenes that displayed the war from an Iraqi perspective would have really balanced things out, and given the film a bit more depth, while still displaying Kyle's heroism. It's not a bad movie, but one that could have definitely been better. |-| 
|-| cnujtd4 || 4 || Very enjoyable.  Glad I caught it.  |-| 
|-| cnujtml || 41 || This is a great movie.  Be prepared, however, for this comment from people who don't understand movies that are structured around themes and characters as opposed to "plot":  Lots of people didn't care for the forward-leaping momentum of the narrative --especially the final chapter.  But this movie is titled *The Place Beyond The Pines* for a reason.  That's the metaphorical term for people going to a place (spiritually, mentally, actually) from which there is no returning to existence as it once was.  And almost every major character makes these sorts of life-changing decisions.  This movie explores its "sins of the fathers" and "the sorrow of irrevocable decisions" concepts almost perfectly.  It's fantastically written, directed, shot, and performed. |-|

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.

|-| cnul91f || 5 || Filth!
 |-| 
|-| cnuliau || -3 || Yes I did watch it and what i found was that the movie was extremely simple and nearly all the criticisms and accusations of being propaganda are well warranted. |-| 
|-| cnulibg || 7 || I love it.  So many emotions.  

I saw this for the first time before I knew I was going to be a father and was very impressed by the acting, the script, and the "3" movies within a movie.  

Then I watched it shortly after my son's 1st birthday.  Totally different perspective.  There were scenes that just crushed me.  Gosling and Cooper were so different in almost every way, it made me think so hard about what I would do, and what I have to do to make sure my kid has an awesome life and know that he is loved.  How delicate and impressionable my little guy is.  

Sometimes I listen to [The Snow Angel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3kKbvXCFfI) very softly while I watch my son/wife sleep and it brings me to tears almost every time.  

 |-| 
|-| cnuljm4 || 3 || The movie is not Pro-War; it was about what war does to people. It could be conceived as Pro-American because it is, after all, about an American soldier. 


As far as the movie goes, I thought it was just average. The best scene was the one shown in the trailer, and the rest was a sub-par war movie IMO. |-| 
|-| cnulkxp || 23 || Hmm, I would not be surprised or even upset if they tried to establish a World War Z cinematic universe at this point.

I know the concept is already wearing thin for some people but it honestly seems like the best way to properly adapt the source material. Set up several different movies from different perspectives during the war like in the book and then have it lead up into a big climactic crossover film with the main characters of each solo movie coming together to initiate the final phase that saves humanity.  |-| 
|-| cnulo1s || 4 || &gt;  In theory, all the good, non-terrorists had been cleared out of the city, which is why there was no normal Muslims, only radical terrorists and affiliates with those terrorists. 

There's just so many things wrong with your sentence I don't know where to start. |-| 
|-| cnulo2h || 10 || It portrays Kyle as nearly infallible, and celebrates his hundreds of kills. Not once is what he or the rest of the American military is doing in Iraq really questioned seriously and the one person that does question it is killed and their questioning of the war is seemingly the reason he dies. Also the fact that Kyle in the movie seemingly solves his PTSD in one scene sort of trivializes a huge and often times incurable disease. It can be seen as propaganda because it creates an American hero out of guy who probably wasn't solely because he killed so many Iraqis. If he was a sniper with 10 kills and came back no one would know his name. |-| 
|-| cnulpuc || 16 || I'm pretty surprised by how much of the actual set they had built. The entire trilogy seemed overly drenched in CG and whatnot. |-| 
|-| cnulq15 || 3 || Unpopular opinion, but I actually think there is some merit in the television movie adaptation of IT. Specifically how it approaches the two split timelines of the Losers Club from childhood into adulthood.

The childhood sequences were extremely well done I felt, establishing the tone and mood of this portion as sinister and tense. The scene where Beverley Marsh is in the bathroom and the balloons start coming out from the sink, before promptly exploding into bursts of blood all over her father's face, who seems none the wiser about it, was pretty darn great. 

As for the adult section, I don't know about you but it felt extremely camp and almost jovial, which made sense with what the filmmakers wanted to explore: the Losers Club experiencing the childhood they never had due to the circumstances of It's cycle. But I'd like to see something more faithful to the novel.  |-| 
|-| cnulsx8 || -7 || I just watched it last night and I felt like I got punched in the face by uncle sam. They made him out to be some kind of Uber American Hero, which I thought was kind of over the top, but Considering that Clint Eastwood directed it, i think it makes sense.  |-| 
|-| cnum2lv || 9 || I loved the chemistry between Mendes and Gosling's characters. |-| 
|-| cnum4iq || 7 || Phenomenal movie, thought it was completely underrated. The teenage actors rose to the same level as their adult acting counterparts, and the progression from first to second to third acts were impressively built out and moving. I watch this movie every 4 or 5 months and find new aspects that blow me away. Even loved Ray Liotta  |-| 
|-| cnum88v || 9 || I watched it, and thought it was a pretty lazy attempt at showing the effects of war on soldiers. If Eastwood really wanted to get that across he would've dedicated more of the movie to Kyle dealing with PTSD and should have definitely shown his death. Eastwood is getting increasingly lazy with his direction in movies and his production-line style of directing really showed in this one. The trailer had more life in it than the movie. That said Cooper and Miller did great work in a movie that seemed determined to get the worst out of them. |-| 
|-| cnumf3x || 23 || "We subject you to the vampire circle of shame. Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Well, that was a shame." |-|

|-| cnumfq5 || 12 || almost every character he's done sine Fear and Loathing has been some variation on Hunter S. Thompson |-| 
|-| cnuml6e || -11 || It is pro war for starters, because idiots like you keep repeating the word "terrorist" when the invading army was the actual terrorist. The people were fighting against foreign invaders. Phrasing it like "we were all good and only the evil terrorists are left so everyone is fair game" is pro America and pro war. How do you not see this?

Second, the war does little to look at the negative effects of soldiers in war, it ignores all his crazy claims in the book and creates a perfect hero that "just helps his brothers to win the fight." It ignores the mental illness Kyle obviously had and turns him into Captain America.

All this is pro America and pro war, especially because it's talking about the bullshit Iraqi war. Comparing the fight to 9/11 is also pro-America, since everyone else in the world knew Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11.

Who cares how successful the movie is? It just says a lot about how much society in America (ironically full of so-called Christians) are simple minded war mongering people that are easily tricked by propaganda. |-| 
|-| cnumlba || -3 || It really need Steven Spielberg directing it. Would it done as well, probably not. Would it be a much better movie,  yes. |-|

|-| cnumqu0 || 4 || Inconceivable!  |-| 
|-| cnumt40 || 144 || Frankly I was underwhelmed by the movie. I felt that I had already seen it when I watched The Hurt Locker back in 2009. Same concept of a lone macho dude with a dangerous job in an already dangerous field and the subplot of PTSD. American sniper isn't terrible, but I was generally ambivalent.  |-| 
|-| cnumtsf || -4 || I tried to watch Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas today. After 10 minutes of Johnny Depp's facial expressions and voice over narration I had to stop the movie. Fucking annoying as shit and it's not even one of those Disney movies.  |-|

|-| cnunagq || 3 || Despite Reddit's contempt for him, Johnny Depp is one of the finest actors around. I enjoy his movies. They are entertaining and that is what he sets out to do with each performance. He gets lost in a role and has fun with it. With the exception of the pale makeup, all of his characters are unique.

*The Lone Ranger* was a great western that wasn't marketed well. *Dark Shadows* was an excellent movie based on an old soap opera from the '70s. It was a good adaptation. If more people knew that going in, it would have been better received. I'm looking forward to seeing *Mortdecai*. It will be entertaining. He doesn't need the money, so it's obvious he enjoys the roles he chooses to play. However, it's no wonder he's debating about quitting acting since he gets ridiculed for choosing to act with a director he likes or a character who would be fun. 
 |-| 
|-| cnunbrp || 5 || This movie makes me cry, every time.  It's so beautiful and tragic.  What it shows about fathers and sons and everything being a cycle is just fantastic. |-| 
|-| cnunm4d || 3 || He's been a character actor since Edward Scissorhands. Ed Wood, Raoul Duke, Ichabod Crane, Jack Sparrow, Willy Wonka, Mad Hatter. I think he's great at it but his roles have been getting worse and worse. |-|

Def a flawed movie, but I still love it.  |-| 
|-| cnuob7r || 5 || Went in to the movie expecting to experience a story as told from a patriotic redneck, directed by an 80 year old republican, and………. actually wasn't disappointed. I think a lot of people are going into the film expecting something different?  |-|

Especially Dave Dehaan riding his bike with his father's glasses, shot the same way with the same beautiful song playing. Simply great filmmaking.  |-| 
|-| cnup9yp || 3 || 11:14.

|-| cnuprd9 || -7 || People are just pissy that a movie in 2014 is unapologetically pro-military and somewhat patriotic, the latter of which (even "somewhat") is a huge taboo since 2008ish. Another taboo the movie broke with are Muslim terrorists without a fulfileld quota of a "good Muslim" who basically looks at the audience and explains these crazy ones are but a small minority. Lastly, in 2014 any movie that features a white lead killing non-white people is going to stir up anger. Skin color and political correctness can dominate buzz/talk of a movie enormously, just look at what happened with Exodus.

So you have fat limousine liberals like Michael Moore calling Kyle a coward and the ever-so-edgy "hurr durr Inglorious Basterds" joke.

I think a lot of the anger from the media (which is mostly dominated by a single ideology) is because this is doing so well and Selma, which was dubbed the movie of year before it was even released, is floundering. |-|

|-| cnuqgbu || 3 || American Gangster had the name "American" in it and yet it wasn't really patriotic at all.  My issue with the film was not the idea that America is a force for moral good (I do not think the film was necessarily pro-war, but pro-America), but that it came off as too blatantly obvious.  The guy was a typical American hero character and his original motivations for joining the army are more or less still with him by the end of his tours (in addition to a desire to protect his comrades in arms). |-|

|-| cnurek6 || -5 || How about everybody stops shouting their opinions about this movie and its portrayal of Muslims and War. The movie was based on a true story and like many of the other books and memoirs written about the siege of Falujia (not spelled right) in 2003 it shows how savage and flat out evil those people are. |-| 
|-| cnurfwp || 3 || Haven't seen the movie, did read the book.  I understand that it's a war and people die, my problem was Chris Kyle sounded like he was on a Crusade at times.  People I know fought in Iraq and Afghanistan and they killed people.  They just don't seem as pumped about it, it was something that needed doing as opposed to sport.  The man accomplished feats I couldn't pretend to even attempt,  but he's also a proven liar.   |-|

Some of the chapters were just downright hilarious.  I actually felt embarrassed for the author with the orientalism in the Japanese chapter.  I half expected the old blind guy to summon a Japanese spirit or pull out some glorious nippon steel and go Kill Bill on the zombies.

When you claim a movie is based on a true story, you have a moral obligation to at least not make it look like a level in Call of Duty.

|-| cnusthc || 4 || So....ill ask the inevitable question

"Will the scene involving the subterranean gangbang of a 12 year old occur?" |-| 
|-| cnustlq || 5 || I died at the bit with the sketching of outfits. So good. |-| 
|-| cnut13h || -13 || As far as calling him out on exposing cover ups, that just doesn't work.  If there was evidence supporting his claims they wouldn't really be cover-ups would they.  The whole idea of a cover-up is that there is no evidence.  So of course if you researched it you would find evidence to the contrary, that's how it got covered up.  The rest makes good sense though.  |-| 
|-| cnut4w2 || 3 || 28 days later |-| 
|-| cnutbm3 || -10 || This is great and I completely agree with it except on a few points.  The WMD's.  We were told 3 days after the fact, that we were hit with Mustard Gas in Camp Commando Kuwait, and that they never rang the alarm for us to don our gas masks and NBC gear.  We believed it was residue from a Scud that was taken out by a Patriot Missile.  Now WMD's or not, I don't want to argue, I want to get to the facts and I will point things out that I know or have heard of.  ISIS came in contact with thousands of tons of weapons grade uranium or plutonium over the summer...that they found in a building/warehouse in Iraq.  No one immediately ran out and said it, but it was shown to have been there since the war started, which is scary.  Could we have missed it, I think so.  But what's scarier to me is that we knew it was there and left it, and yes I've seen enough messed up crap to know that we actually do this.  Now as for the Mustard Gas, no one can deny they didn't have it, it was made in America, we gave it to Iraq for the Iran/Iraq war.  Whether you consider this a WMD or not, technically it is.  Now weapons from foreign countries like France, this did happen and I'm sure you can all look it up.  France sold Iraq, during the embargo, "impenetrable" bunkers, that we took out btw.  A lot of people were saying while we were there, that this is why France didn't support the invasion, that they had sold Iraq a lot to make a profit.  There was only one missile that reached our base during the main part of the war in 2003 in Kuwait.  It was designed to fly close to the ground under the radar, and luckily for us, even though it landed right outside our base's entrance, it was meant as a harpoon for aircraft carriers we were told.  Word going around was that it was a French designed missile, and we knew this because it was the only one, and the Iraqi's didn't have that type of technology yet.  There were a lot of weird things going on, and I pointed out, we didn't secure crap after we took Baghdad.  Anyone could have come in there dressed as civilians and taken anything.  Intelligence or whatever, and they did.  And I kept pointing out to people that the reason why we might have said there were no WMD's and the whole thing was a lie, was because any WMD's might have been snuck out of the country, and we literally have no clue who has them now.  I hope I'm wrong, but there was so much bs going on out there, even into my 2nd deployment, I'm convinced anything could happen or have happened.  Didn't anyone see that news article that CIA agents and our military claimed that American Corporate reps in Iraq told them they would have them killed if they didn't do what they wanted?  No one was trying to rebuild that country.  We took out things that didn't need to be taken out to take over the country, electrical infrastructure, water works, things that wouldn't stop their Army, but would put the country in devastation.  Fubar. |-| 
|-| cnutd4a || 8 || Caught it on a flight towards the back end of last year - hilarious film, a very fun concept that's executed almost perfectly.

Also, Stu is a hero. |-| 
|-| cnutdmk || -4 || Do you think one of the two brothers is like, by far, the workhorse and kind of resents the other brother? Maybe one brother is the creative genius but he gets bullied and abused by the other brother both physically and mentally. 

I hope thats not the case, but if it is, I hope the antique typewriter that is used to writer "their" screenplays never starts seemingly writing messages back to the creative brother telling him to kill the violent brother. That would be a tragedy, because I really enjoy their movies. |-|

|-| cnuu1sw || 3 || I think the best way to approach this is as a contained series instead of a large blockbuster franchise. Band of Brothers style high budget series with a definitive endpoint.

There are enough stories in the book for producers and writers to cherry-pick the tales that would translate well into film. Yonkers and the Crashed Pilot would definitely be interesting episodes, while others like the guy who sold Phalanx can be cut.

Even if each individual story wasn't long enough to drag into an hour-long episode, I'm sure they could stuff 2-3 stories together, and segment the entire series like the book did it - based on the different phases of the zombie war. |-|

|-| cnuul27 || -3 || Good article until the second half where the author breaks the news that most people are unwilling to change their minds when confronted with new evidence.

|-| cnv46w4 || 558 || Big Trouble in Little China is one of my favorite movies because it's the story of a legendary Chinese epic about gods and kings and magic and true love, ghosts and immortality and monsters and unspeakable evil, all seen from the perspective of an ignorant white guy who doesn't care, is only tangentially involved, and just wants his truck back. Mechanically, if you look at the beats, the story is really *about* him getting his truck back, and all this other shit is just happening around him and getting in the way of him getting his truck. I don't know of any other movie that does "small part of a greater story" as well as it does without feeling disconnected or forced.

I read an interview of Kurt Russel where he told the story about how he and one of the writers took the script to a studio exec who read it and came back to them and was like, "hey, if i'm reading this right, this little asian guy is actually the hero and Kurt, you're just some idiot sidekick." And they turned to each other and were like "He gets it! I don't think he likes it, but he *gets it*!" |-|

|-| cnv7196 || 3 || One of my favorite movies of all time! My parents showed it to my sister and I when we were super little and we watched and re-watched that VHS continuously. When we weren't watching it, I was running around with a laundry basket on my head, throwing down some sick karate moves and summoning the storms.

|-| cnv7bdh || 3 || If you watch the DVD commentary its with John Carpenter and Kurt Russell. First thing that caught my attention was how annoying Kurt Russell's laugh is, and how likable Carpenter is. 

Second thing that intrigued me was evidently when this movie came out Asians thought Carpenter was being racist. Many of them did not like how they portrayed the characters and the martial arts movie genre. It sort of sucks because that who he was trying to appease, having grown up loving the genre. 

Carpenter goes on to explain that the main protagonist is actually the Asian guy, since he does all of the heavy fighting and Jack Burton doesn't do jack shit except tell jokes. I think he maybe shoots a gun one time and here he is getting his ass handed to him while the Asian dude is tearing people apart. Evidently it was refreshing for Kurt to play that type of character.

TLDR watch the audio commentary on this DVD. Its very interesting and tells why the movie didn't do well.  |-|

"Same Land. Same God. Different Dreams." - Gettysburg  |-| 
|-| cnviizk || 118 || Megatron in the Bay Transformers movies. No, wait, seriously, hear me out!

So this is a guy who is the general of an army fighting a war for thousands of years against psychotic fascist dickbags like Optimus Prime (we'll get back to this). His planet slowly becomes devoid of resources after the Transformers' very source of life (the AllSpark) is jettisoned off into who the fuck knows where by an Autobot leader who is also sick of the war (Sentinel Prime).

So his people are dying and they're all fucked. Megatron singlehandedly takes on the task of finding the AllSpark to save his entire race. He tracks it across the universe to a primitive planet called Earth where, interestingly enough, his faction's greatest leader once tried to extinguish the sun in order to generate fuel (to save their people).

Only he gets trapped in an icy wasteland. He's mentally fully functioning (I will prove this in a second) but he's just stuck there. Along come some humans who extract him from the ice... only to take him to an underground bunker where they keep him just frozen enough to pick apart his body (per Transformers 1, most modern technology comes from what scientists learn about Megatron's body). On top of that, they don't even know his name and he ends up being called NBE-1 for decades.

Finally, during the start of act 3 of the first movie, he gets rescued. His first words? "I am MEGATRON!" Now why the hell would any reasonable sentient being say that after decades of being frozen? Because he could *hear* the humans calling him NBE-1. It was something he wanted to yell at them for so damn long and when he's finally able to speak again it's the first damn thing he does.

Now Megatron escapes the facility and doesn't actually cause that much unnecessary damage. He just sort of chases after Sam and *asks* him repeatedly to give back the AllSpark. Finally, he gets killed when Sam shoots him with AllSpark power.

Before we move onto movie #2, let's address your concerns about the AllSpark. It's bad, right? Well, that's debatable. Sure it creates some angry robots, but that is apparently the natural state of Transformers. They're born angry and violent. They can't help it. It's a side effect.

Moving onto movie #2. Here's where we see Optimus being a dickbag. He's part of a covert government operation with no oversight. He is using government spy technology to locate *hiding* Decepticons. The "bad guys" who already know they've lost the war, are stranded on an alien planet, and are actually being *robots in disguise.* The Autobots are systematically hunting them down and committing genocide. The Autobots are the invasion force.

They're no less violent than the Decepticons. As a matter of fact, the Autobots are often more prone to instigating violence and causing massive amounts of property damage. 

So Megatron gets resurrected and goes after Sam, the guy who murdered him. While puzzling over the fact that Sam apparently has the knowledge formerly contained in the AllSpark (aka the one thing that can save his entire race), he gets into a fight with Optimus. Optimus savagely beats the ever loving shit out of a few Decepticons (here's where you start noticing the pattern of Optimus specifically attacking and destroying his opponents' faces because he's a goddamn sociopath) before Megatron manages to pull off a victory. 

Megatron reports back to his boss (The Fallen) and they collude about what to do now that the AllSpark is basically lost to them. They decide to do the whole extinguishing-the-sun thing since (from Megatron's perspective of decades of torture) "fuck humans."

That doesn't work out though. Optimus gets sprinkled with fairy dust, wears an old guy as a suit, and kills The Fallen. Megatron runs the fuck away, badly damaged.

Onto movie #3. The Decepticons have no medic. They have a creepy little head with legs that tries to do basic maintenance, but he's basically barely keeping Megatron alive. Fortunately for him, the Decepticons on Earth have been playing the long game for the last few years and have laid a few breadcrumbs so the Autobots can find their own long lost leader on the moon (Sentinel... who is napping on the moon... like The Fallen was...).

Sentinel's big plan? Bring Cybertron (the Transformers home world) to Earth so the humans can be used as a labor force to rebuild the planet. Somehow. Not a super clear plan since it seems like one Decepticon could easily do the work of like 20 humans... but I guess their race is just that fucked.

Anyway, in spite of a face that looks like a tiger fucked an iceberg, you can totally see the absolute relief on Megatron's face when he finally sees Cybertron. One annoying human berates him until he eventually goes over to Optimus and Sentinel planning to kill them both (they're monsters, so it's actually a good idea). He fails.

But we're not done yet...

Megatron's body is recovered by humans. They use the technology of his body to try and make their own transformers. Because that's a great idea. Anyway, the big problem the humans keep having is that Galvatron, their "leader" prototype, keeps ending up with a weird Megatron-like face. 

Take a step back. What does Optimus do when he's fighting his enemies? He crushes their faces. The transformers all have fairly unique faces, all things considered. Faces are a big deal. They mean something. Robots in disguise and symbolism and all that. 

And Megatron, barely alive, is reaching out and trying to put his face on a new body. It's all he has.

At the end of the day, Galvatron, with his army of prototype soldiers, is all like "fuck this, I'm out" and he just drives the fuck away. 

TL;DR: Megatron: trapped in his own body, picked apart by humans, repeatedly has his plans to SAVE HIS OWN RACE dicked over by his enemies who are basically taking over the planet, trapped in his own body again, and now stuck in a new body with fragments of memories and PTSD. |-|

George Lucas didn't have as much direct control over the original three films as people think. In the first one, the actors rewrote most of their lines and his wife helped to edit the film.

I also loved some of the sequences when you see the time lapse of San Francisco during the 70's. There were also a lot of shots I loved, and you can't tell which one is digital or practical. 

Overall, it's one of my favorite crime thrillers, and Fincher manages to end the film on a satisfying note, given how the actual murder case has yet to be solved.

Nah but really, glad you enjoyed it. 

Seven (stylised as Se7en) is another great film by Fincher. **DO NOT LOOK IT UP ON WIKIPEDIA** or etc, it will spoil it for you. Just buy/rent/iTunes etc the movie, and watch it. If you look up to see what it's about, Google may spoil a big moment of the movie.

It's a serial killer film, but while Zodiac focuses on character development and is a character study about how the events of the film change the characters, Se7en is more about the action and excitement of the movie.

David Fincher's one of the best directors of today and I'd say all time, when you have the chance check out Fight Club, The Social Network, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo

|-| cnvq512 || 7 || * Mason's mom saying about her life "I just thought there would be more", when Mason goes off to college in *Boyhood*
* The box cutter scene in *Gone Girl* (the Cool Girl monologue was a bit too abridged from the book for my taste but also a great scene)
* Any scene with Ralph Fiennes in *The Grand Budapest Hotel*. I had no idea he was hilarious. Every character I've seen him play has been broody and tragic. |-|

|-| cnvrdzc || 7 || I'll try to add some new ones that I don't think I've seen:  

* When Riggan first meets/acts with Mike Shiner in Birdman. Also Riggan vs. the critic and Emma's monologue. Also every other scene in Birdman honestly.
* The entirety of the ski mountain meet-up/getaway in The Grand Budapest Hotel
* The Mexican restaurant scene in Nightcrawler
* I Love You All from Frank
* The climax of The Drop with Tom Hardy and Matthias Schoenaerts.

And of course the stuff others mentioned like the ending to Whiplash, the stuff from Gone Girl, the docking scene, the beach in Calvary, etc. |-|

|-| cnvvg8a || 3 || Final scene of **Enemy.**  There's plenty of other good scenes in Enemy too, but the final scene and what it means, great stuff. |-| 
|-| cnvvkhf || 3 || The fight scene in Snowpiercer when they go through the tunnel, and it's pitch black. Then **spoilers** the kid comes running with the match, it turns into a torch, and all of a sudden everybody is running forward with torches. I was cheering so hard when that happened. |-| 
|-| cnvx2oa || -5 || Stars wars is for losers, so is star trek - they're both one and the same. Wrath of God is much better.  www.mxenaj.blogspot.co.uk  Disney are cunts. Just like the rest of them... Which is no surprise really.  |-|

|-| cnvxn7y || 3 || Good, maybe less plot holes and galactic senate boring issues. |-| 
|-| cnvy2kv || 4 || I feel that way about most movies I watch. Not because I don't enjoy them or that I find fault in them. But more because I like to lose myself on the first watch through. Every movie is a new narrative to dive into. A new world to explore. So I always find myself wanting to go back after the first watch to really look at the vfx, a particular actor's performance, a particular scene, etc. Most movies, in my opinion, benefit from multiple viewings.

|-| cnvz09p || 3 || A Scanner Darkly. Those last 20 minutes are mind-boggling if you don't pay attention. |-| 
|-| cnvz6ye || 3 || Kill List.

After watching it first, I thought it as a failed mixture of family drama and Se7en-ish horror movie. But after pondering on it during the two days following and realizing what was really going on, I watched it again and fell in love.

If you don't mind brutality against people (I realized it's hard to watch for many people), I highly recommend you to watch it. |-| 
|-| cnvzb2a || 3 || Birdman. The ending is beautifully ambiguous and I feel like if I printed out the screenplay I could analyze the dialogue like I was back in English class.  |-| 
|-| cnvzhl4 || -6 || *Saving Private Ryan.* When I first watched it, I was too young to truly appreciate the depiction of the sacrifices our troops made to ensure that the USA retained its god-given position as \#1 in the world; for me, it was merely a decent action film, rather than the patriotic revelation it should have been. Now that I'm older and worldlier, I feel I'm ready to truly honor the film, as was intended.

He's done good work since then - just not in that particular role.

Microsoft is using it as a buzzword because it sounds way cooler than "sort of uses a lot of tricks to mimic the idea of a hologram from Sci-fi". Real holograms are both more impressive and more limited than anything in sci-fi. More limited because they (in their normal form) contain a static (or only a few frames of an) image that is very difficult/limiting/expensive to make. They are also monochrome under most circumstances. They are more impressive than their movie or fake technology counterparts because they have a glasses free hyper hyper HYPER (that's THREE with capitalization) detailed images if made with the utmost care. The can look like a true window into another world that just happens to be monochrome. They can store microscopic detail and even optical patterns of reflectivity and distortion (i.e. you can see the refraction of a pair of glasses change the background INSIDE the hologram. You can interactively re-light captures images of metallic surfaces INSIDE the hologram.)
 They are truly space age and not appreciated like they should be. |-|

&gt; Pathé Tuschinski is a movie theater in the Netherlands in Amsterdam commissioned by Abraham Icek Tuschinski in 1921 at a cost of 4 million guilders. The interior and exterior are a spectacular mix of styles, as designed by Hijman Louis de Jong; Amsterdam School, Jugendstil, Art Nouveau and Art Deco. The main auditorium hosts many premieres of Dutch films. It is considered as one of the most beautiful cinemas in the world.

|-| cnxelte || 175 || Good for Channing Tatum.  Did anybody watch the Actor's Roundtable this year that THR did? 

There was this great moment where Benedict Cumberbatch was asked a question about Alan Turing, and he went into a long, eloquent, and seemingly unprepared story about some of the work of Turing, his personal life, and his own preparation for the role.  He made quite a few statements that showed how well-read and intelligent Cumberbatch is, and how much intellectually he puts into his acting.  

Then Channing was asked a question about Foxcatcher, and proceeded to give a really earnest answer, but it came off like a fifth grader being forced to do a book report presentation on a book he didn't read, but everyone else in the class read.  

It was uncomfortable for a minute (despite a really encouraging group at the table), but then Tatum interrupted himself to say that he struggled a lot in school, and that he worried for a long time that not being smart and not being able to approach things intellectually would hold him back from being a successful person. 

He said when he found acting, he was relieved to find something that made sense to him, something he enjoyed, and that people praised him for. He alludes to the fact that he wouldn't be able to do much else, because his talents aren't intellectual.  Benedict Cumberbatch said something like, "that puts you ahead of most people, I think, to know your strengths and weaknesses and then use that knowledge to set yourself up for success."

Every time I read something about Tatum being sought for a high-profile movie or director, I feel proud for him, like he's one of those guys who deserves continued fortune.  

**EDIT** Thanks to /u/mochibombs for linking [to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdhv95gC1LQ).  Cumberbatch is the first person who talks, then Eddie Redmayne, and then Tanning's portion starts around 13 minutes in.  I recommend the whole thing, though!  |-| 
|-| cnxemhq || -5 || Channing Tatum is a phenomenal actor and I'm sick of him getting snubbed for awards because of his eye candy reputation. If anyone doubts me just watch "Fox Catcher".

I don't like the trend of splitting movies into unnecessary parts it diminishes quality and is a cheap tactic. I would rather see GotG be rewarded since if was a refreshing take from the superhero movies marvel usually makes. |-|

This is what zombie movies (shows anything) are, especially when it's based off a game where they are just your typical zombies.

What's a different zombie movie?  28 days later was not technically zombies, so that rules something like that out.  There's already walking dead which is more focused on a serious drama that is based around zombies.  Idk, again this is coming from a guy that loves the classics, so I'm just not sure what people want.  It's become a trend now, but zombies have been around for so long and they've always been pretty formulaic.  It looks low budget, but it's crackle so what did you expect. |-|

It seems like DreamWorks is always promoting a nee animated movie that has a long list of A list celebs (which I'm sure cost a lot) and they put yhe advertisements everywhere. They were showing behind the scenes clips and whatnot for "Mr. Peabody" MONTHS before it came out. By the time the movie came out, nobody cared.

The Penguins of Madagascar is another one I was scratching my head at. Why make a full legnth movie for side characters after we've already seen them in 3 movies AND their own TV show? Seems like it's about 5 years too late for that one.

DreamWorks needs to start thinking more clearly about what their doing, instead of just throwing a bunch of movies out and hoping for the best. |-| 
|-| cnxytr3 || 8 || Read an interview with the director. He badly wanted Mickey Rooney to star in the movie. Yikes! He also fought tooth and nail with Strauss on every scene, at one point threatening to shut down production completely ("Strauss didn't really understand the story," Bourla said).

It seemed fairly obvious to me that Friday and Friday-Anne were Adam and Eve, kicked out of Paradise by God (Strauss) when they were tempted into sin (sex). I seem to be the only one who thinks this, though.

|-| cogr3kb || 2898 || For those that are just reading the title, Marvel Studios still **does not** control the rights to Spider-Man. This is a collaboration between studios (Sony and Marvel), although it is very exciting that Spider-Man will be a part of the MCU.
  
EDIT, article highlights in case link is broken:  
  
* Kevin Feige (Marvel) and Amy Pascal (Sony) will collaborate on a new creative direction for the web-slinger.   
  
* The new Spider-Man will first appear in a Marvel film from Marvel's Cinematic Universe. - *The first appearance will most likely be "Civil War" releasing on May 6, 2016*  
  
* Sony Pictures will thereafter release the next installment of its $4 billion Spider-Man franchise, on July 28, 2017.  
  
* Sony Pictures will continue to finance, distribute, own and have final creative control of the Spider-Man films.  
  
* Marvel and Sony Pictures are also exploring opportunities to integrate characters from the MCU into future Spider-Man films.  
  
As excited as I am to see Spidey be a part of the MCU, I'm more interested to see how this relationship develops over the years. It might be the most realistic/feasible way for all the studios to work together (ie Marvel getting to use Spidey at Sony/X-Men and Fantastic Four at FOX). Doubt Marvel Studios will ever have complete control over ALL of its characters, but whatever...they're printing their own fucking money at this point.  
  
EDIT 2: Although it might be obvious since this is a "new" Spider-Man, [Linda Ge of The Wrap reports that Andrew Garfield **will not** be playing Spidey again.](https://twitter.com/lindazge/status/565009810093912064) That's really a fucking shame. Garfield would have been a great fit with the MCU/Avengers.  
  
[Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair puts it well though...](https://twitter.com/jowrotethis/status/565032420815011840)  
  
EDIT 3: In case anyone is confused by the story, Sony owns the rights to Spider-Man on film and Marvel Studios wants Spider-Man to play in their cinematic universe (with the Avengers and company). They all exist in the same universe in the comics, but at a time, selling characters off to different film studios was the right decision financially. Now, things have changed. Sony doesn't want to sell the rights to such a huge franchise, but ironically doesn't know how to make a good movie/maximize their earnings. Lots of back and forth between the studios for years. 2015, Sony gets desperate, and the parties reach a middle ground: Marvel will help Sony make future good/lucrative Spider-Man movies and allow them to keep the rights as long as Spidey gets to play with all of their characters (Iron Man, Thor, etc). Ie, "we scratch your back, you scratch ours." Also add to the conversation: **$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$** |-|

(Culver City, California, and Burbank, California February 09, 2015) – Sony Pictures Entertainment and Marvel Studios announced today that Sony is bringing Marvel into the amazing world of Spider-Man. 

Under the deal, the new Spider-Man will first appear in a Marvel film from Marvel's Cinematic Universe (MCU). Sony Pictures will thereafter release the next installment of its $4 billion Spider-Man franchise, on July 28, 2017, in a film that will be co-produced by Kevin Feige and his expert team at Marvel and Amy Pascal, who oversaw the franchise launch for the studio 13 years ago. Together, they will collaborate on a new creative direction for the web slinger. Sony Pictures will continue to finance, distribute, own and have final creative control of the Spider-Man films.

Marvel and Sony Pictures are also exploring opportunities to integrate characters from the MCU into future Spider-Man films.

The new relationship follows a decade of speculation among fans about whether Spider-Man – who has always been an integral and important part of the larger Marvel Universe in the comic books – could become part of the Marvel Universe on the big screen. Spider-Man has more than 50 years of history in Marvel's world, and with this deal, fans will be able to experience Spider-Man taking his rightful place among other Super Heroes in the MCU.

Bob Iger, Chairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Company said: "Spider-Man is one of Marvel's great characters, beloved around the world. We're thrilled to work with Sony Pictures to bring the iconic web-slinger into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which opens up fantastic new opportunities for storytelling and franchise building."

"We always want to collaborate with the best and most successful filmmakers to grow our franchises and develop our characters. Marvel, Kevin Feige and Amy, who helped orchestrate this deal, are the perfect team to help produce the next chapter of Spider-Man," said Michael Lynton, Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment. "This is the right decision for the franchise, for our business, for Marvel, and for the fans."

"Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios share a love for the characters in the Spider-Man universe and have a long, successful history of working together. This new level of collaboration is the perfect way to take Peter Parker's story into the future," added Doug Belgrad, president, Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group.

"I am thrilled to team with my friends at Sony Pictures along with Amy Pascal to produce the next Spider-Man movie," said Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige. "Amy has been deeply involved in the realization on film of one of the world’s most beloved characters. Marvel's involvement will hopefully deliver the creative continuity and authenticity that fans demand from the MCU. I am equally excited for the opportunity to have Spider-Man appear in the MCU, something which both we at Marvel, and fans alike, have been looking forward to for years."

Spider-Man, embraced all over the world, is the most successful franchise in the history of Sony Pictures, with the five films having taken in more than $4 billion worldwide. |-|

Tony Stark is sitting in a cafe (the same one from the Avengers scene) on his own regretting the part he played in creating this mess.

He sighs and exclaims "Can this day get any worse?"

He picks up his Shawarma and goes to take a bite but a web flies in from off-screen and the Shawarma is gone.

Tony looks down on the table and sees a note. The camera zooms in and we see that the note says the following:

"Thanks for the food tincan, next one is on me!

Your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man"

Please refrain from yet another retelling of Spiderman's origin.  Rehashing that story is a waste of time, and at this point, would be a poor use of screen time.  We know who Spiderman is.  We know how he became Spiderman, and we're generally familiar with his world.  You did this wonderfully with the Mark Ruffalo Hulk.  Just get him in the story, and let him interact with the other Avengers/Fantastic Four/whoever.  If any of us have been living under a rock and don't know who Spiderman is, the google-box on the innernetz-machine will have us up to speed in no time.

Also, bring back Thomas Jane as the Punisher, if it's not too much trouble, even if it's just an after-credits easter egg.  Seriously, he was good, and he's still got the chops.

You can do good with this next round of expansions, and we're with you all the way. |-|

not only do we have an actor in Andrew Garfield who can pull off peter and spiderman perfectly and has just been a victim of being involved with a franchise which splits the audience, but rebooting peter parker again will just cause massive character fatigue which is difficult to over come. I suggest either reaching a compromise (much like sony has had to do) and use Andrew Garfield's character or separate themselves completely by using Miles Morales |-|

I'm glad they did a revamp and I was excited to see where they took this version of Spiderman. I hated the Toby McGuire Spiderman movies so I'm glad they let that die off.

Sort of off topic but technology really blows my mind sometimes. Look at the technology that Mark Hamill, along with everyone who worked on Episode IV, had available to them back in 1976/1977. Fast forward to 2014/2015 and here they are working on a new Star Wars movie and worrying about drones flying around and spying on them.

I think the clarification in the second sentence is important. He's essentially saying that regardless of how good (or bad) it is, it is still going to be a movie. The quote in the title alone, and the very existence of the article, makes it seem like he doesn't think it's going to be all that great, when he isn't actually commenting on the quality of the film *in any way*. A more accurate title might have been "Annoyed by Overzealous Fans, Mark Hamill States the Obvious," but I guess that wouldn't have been very catchy. |-|

New director. New owner.  Overhyped to hell.  A lot of people involved who probably shouldn't be in making decisions and the end product. 

If it's 1) not outright ruined by inappropriate romance scenes, and 2) better than *Matrix 2*, I'll be satisfied. Is that low enough for you? |-|

|-| cogqyfd || 3 || &gt;" These people that build it up in their minds like it’s going to be the second coming of, I don’t know what — they’re bound to be disappointed.”

The words you're looking for, Mark, are *"Star"* and *"Wars"*. People are expecting the second coming of Star Wars.  |-| 
|-| cogrj7o || 3 || Mark Hamill seems to believe he is a real person.. Poor thing :( |-| 
|-| coglr4p || 10 || I know the story is going to be good... but I'm also sure some people will, as they did with the prequels, come in with WILDLY INCORRECT assumptions about how shit works in Star Wars universe... and in this case, specifically, how the Force works. And so you will have people freaking out about how "this isn't how the Force works" and "this makes no sense! Why wouldn't Luke do..." etc... but that's because they don't understand the foundation of the story. 

Let me explain:

1. The Force is used by EVERYONE. Not just Jedi. EVERYONE. However, Jedi are highly sensitive to the Force and learn how to utilize it in powerful ways.

2. Some people are more Force sensitive than others without any training. People like Anakin... Luke... and perhaps some people in the future.

3. Even Han uses the Force. He doesn't know he's using the Force, but he does. He just thinks it is skill, or luck, or bad luck. But in George's universe, it is the Force speaking its will through everyone and everything.

4. The midichlorian stuff was brought up to illustrate how this is something that exists as a physical part of every living thing, not just a magical thing. The magic is in how it is used... this is where people completely missed it and lost their shit when it was introduced in TPM, and have continued to pretend it means something else for FIFTEEN FUCKIN' YEARS. Imagine that... 15 years to keep believing the same bullshit that it "demystified the Force" when it simply said some people have more of this than others. Much like IQ, having an abundance of potential only means you have potential.

5. Anakin brought balance to the Force, not Luke. Through his attachment to his son. His love for Padme, and in turn for his children, gave him the strength to kill his master. The prequels are about how WRONG the Jedi Order was about love... attachment. That it wasn't Anakin's disregard for Jedi rules that delivered him to the dark side, but the Jedi Order's refusal to BEND that drove a powerful Force user to seek other means to save the one he loved.

6. So, when you get to THE FORCE AWAKENS and the fuckin' movie doesn't follow your preconceived notions about what Luke should be doing... you're going to freak the fuck out. Because you've spent way too long not understanding a story made for children. |-| 
|-| cogb8yd || 7 || http://i.imgur.com/t44JdSB.gif |-| 
|-| cogjale || 3 || It will be no where near as good as the originals and no where near as bad as the prequels. |-| 
|-| coga9bh || 3 || I don't know, I think most people have some pretty managed expectations for a movie and a new set of lore that'll be replacing a lot of the universe that some of us grew up reading. 

Really though, I'm pretty excited for the movie.  Understanding this is what we've got now, I'm curious to see where they decide to take canon from here with the full backing of the Disney empire.   |-| 
|-| cogjnb2 || 3 || Haters are the loudest.  For every one person online/on reddit bitching about the prequels there's 20 or more people like me who *ate that shit up like candy*.  Binks was no worse than threepio, or the ewoks, they're family movies people. |-| 
|-| cogshw4 || 3 || Star Wars 7 is going to suck, Jurassic World is going to suck, Age of Ultron will be entertaining because Marvel has the formula down pat but still be a meh movie. |-| 
|-| cogt86q || 3 || One reason to manage your expectations is because it's being directed by J.J Abrams, the man who turned Star Trek into a generic action movie and has literally nothing else good in his filmography. Well, unless we count Super 8, which was about half of a good movie. 

The only films he's directed are:

MI3 

Anatomy of Hope (Tv movie)

Star Trek

Super 8

Star Trek: Into Darkness

Now which part of that lineup is supposed to get me excited for the new Star Wars movie being made by this guy? Was it the generalization of a beloved franchise? Was it the "interesting premise that probably should have been made by Speilberg if we wanted it to be good" that was Super 8? Was it the random TV movie and like 10 episodes worth of TV shows that he's made? I honestly don't get how poeple can be anything but highly skeptical about this movie being any better than the prequels. To be frank I'd take 90's Lucas over Abrams at this point.

|-| cog1u0r || 205 || Yes, needless provocation. Let's go with that.

Not like they'd murder any citizen who even touches those DVDs or anything. |-| 
|-| cog5swg || 20 || Why not drop a DVD with a message explaining the barbaric behaviors and how the world sympathizes with the people and not the government, and how they can effectively start an uprising? You know, instead of hoping they get why it's funny that their leader enjoys a pop song?

|-| coge74r || 5 || These idiots are going to get some pour curious soul killed. |-| 
|-| cogimpq || 6 || Sadly I feel like this movie is more insulting to the people of North Korea than to their regime. 

The people there KNOW something is wrong, they receive all kinds of media from the south via smugglers and pirate radio/TV trasmissions, they can literally walk into a department store and be told they're not allowed to buy an item even though there appears to be a large surplus. There are droves and droves of orphan children that walk the street begging, bodies do turn up occasionally. Enacting change from under an oppressive regime is extremely difficult, it's not as simple as just saying they need to 'rise up', as nice of a notion as that is, these are people who are malnourished, lack weapons, and in many cases proper education. This movie just rubs their face in the shit, assuming they don't know and pleading with them to do something about it ; "Opening their eyes for them".

Also, the movie literally opens on a gay joke featuring Eminem; many North Koreans don't even have a concept of what 'gay' is.

To me it seems the purpose of this movie was to raise Western awareness in a format and terms they're comfortable with, consequently it became a giant circlejerk. |-|

|-| cogbcg2 || 12 || Having seen the movie I can sum it up like this:

This movie is a rewrite of the Matrix but instead of robots harvesting humans to be their batteries, its a few spoiled rich people who are harvesting humans to be their batteries. |-| 
|-| cog56zv || 10 || This movie should have been about that substance that grants (near?) everlasting life and the family's struggle to gain a foothold in that business, ending with the death of the mother. 

 |-| 
|-| cogexhc || 10 || He missed a seriously fantastic source of hilarity in there. The space battle right before Tater-tots crashes into the wedding was LITERALLY **JUST** EXPLOSIONS. Nothing happened in that fight except explosions upon explosions upon explosions. It was beutiful.

Also the DMV scene wasn't there for that one joke, it was there solely as a reference to Brazil, all leading up to a Terry Gilliam cameo at the end. Basically they were trying to make this movie like every single sci-fi movie they'd ever seen and that was one of them. |-| 
|-| cog8usl || 30 || **SPOILERS (because I'm doing this on my phone and am too lazy to go with the whole deal of typing that out. Beware)**

I mostly agree with this review (although I liked the film) but there's a few explanations present within the film that I think YMS missed.

- the death of lizard dude came from the device that Caine uses opening walls and floors that we constantly see him use (and which was used to enter the harvesting chamber right below their fight and still in use while they were duking it out). Caine shoved Lizard Dude into the hole and quickly closed it to strangle him.

- The oxygen suits that Caine puts on in Jupiter the planet before giving on to... Er, Jupiter the person was not for while they were on... *sigh* Jupiter the planet but due to the fact that Caine expected the two of them to at least be forced to go into space by entering the closing portal themselves which is what happens. (This does not change the fact that the film is excessively inconsistent on how oxygen is affected in space. Like WTF).

- This is just speculation but I'm sure Caine and Stinger's wings are less "Oh I need these" and more a sign of reinstatement into the Aegis. 

- Bees recognizing royalty is a reference to their hive mind arrangement, not as random as expected.

- That "I love dogs" scene? I didn't recognize it as serious. I recognized it as deliberately awkward. That Caine left immediately afterward because Jupiter made it awkward, when Jupiter rolled her eyes I didn't read that as orgasm, I read that as "ugh, I'm a fucking idiot." But these are terrible performances we're talking about.

- Caine also resembles a wolf in more than his ears. His jaw is more extended in a canine manner, a bit of prosthetics work that looks so fucking uncomfortable that I hope to attribute Tatum's boring sleepy performance (I usually love the dude) to it. Also most of the cast resembles animals in more ways than just their ears, we got elephant face guy, we got Balem's right hand guy looking like a rodent, we got fucking lizard dude, fer chrissakes. (Side Note: Part of why I am sure YMS just wasn't paying attention to the film is because when he comes to this point, he claims the information of Caine's genetic origins comes at the middle of the movie when Caine and Jupiter are saying "blahblahIlovedogs". We are told of Caine's origins waaaaaayyyyyy before that with Jupiter on Stinger's farm with a lengthy and absolutely exhaustive monologue Sean Bean gives about Caine and Stinger's previous life. Like it was its own scene by itself. This is just the first time Jupiter bothers to bring it up because she is too wary to mention Caine murdering a Royal earlier on. The fact YMS thinks that THIS is where we, the audience, learn said information implies that YMS was not paying attention.)

- The never-less-than-presentable toilet scrubber Jupiter saying she hates her life is in reference to the later fact that we discover her previous form, the Queen, herself was in the best position possible and still hated her life enough to arrange her own murder.

- The whole Brazil bureaucracy scene wasn't for a joke about the DMV, but because much of the film's plot centers on legalities and claims for Jupiter to make and loopholes of the law. Hell, that's precisely the only thing that keeps the Abrasax siblings from doing anything rash.

- Speaking of rash, the important thing to recall is that this sibling rivalry and family business. The siblings are essentially children who play at being adults as best as they can but they slip, hence why Balem's would start acting like a selfish indulgent little shit when he doesn't get his way. That said, Redmayne still overdid it. A lot. He could have toned it down and not really get caught acting. And Kalique didn't really do much beyond give some more exposition. Ugh, exposition. And I can understand if the relationship between the siblings is missed since they only have one scene together and only two scenes in which one of then talks with Jupiter about the others. They didn't really allow the relationship to be integrated into the tale or affect the plot so much as just being character background with graceless underdevelopment.

- If you saw the film, you know damn well why the telescope matters to Jupiter, they don't need to explain it verbally.

- I also don't think Jupiter cared much for ruling the world in the end, especially after learning the circumstances of the Queen's death. She just was in the middle of this fight, not involved until the big moment where had to choose her family or the Earth.

There are still a lot of good points YMS made and even more flaws I can point to in the film, even as I walked out of the movie with a smile on my face (I had fun, what can I say?). Its just that I still think YMD missed a few story elements that would have answered some of his questions. |-| 
|-| cofz4b5 || 13 || as an experiment I'm avoiding all publicity and spoilers for this film, i miss that feeling of not knowing everything about a film when watching it

|-| cogtv3r || 50 || I'm not really surprised it would have been a lot of effort for them to have 4 movies out in 2017.

The big news is really that Inhumans is coming after Infinity War Part Two. I guess they won't be involved? Also leaves questions open about Captain Marvels involvement. |-|

|-| cogtxyk || 17 || So, does Marvel now have a financial stake in the standalone Spidey films?

I wonder how much sway they'll have with release dates?

And how this affects Sony's contractual need to produce a new Spider-Man film every x years.

Edit: Just to clarify, I'm wondering if Marvel gets a percentage of the standalone Spider-Man box office gross. If they don't, it seems weird for them to eliminate their own Marvel film from 2017. So I'm assuming that they were willing to push everything and accommodate Sony because doing also helps their bottom line (ie: at least as much as releasing all the films they originally intended to release in 2017 would have contributed to their bottom line). |-| 
|-| cogueaj || 8 || You win some you lose some. |-| 
|-| cogwnmx || 22 || Just scrap Civil War being officially a Captain America film and make it a full-blown Avengers movie. They all fight and break up. Then the Infinity Saga can be about them being forced to be united again.

I have to admit though, it is a bummer we have to wait longer to see Loki fucking shit up in Asgard as the new king. |-| 
|-| cogyx60 || 7 || I am kind of dissapointed by this, I mean, I've seen 5 spiderman movies now. What I've not seen is Captain Marvel, Black Panther or the Inhumans. Now I have to wait another year for all of them. |-| 
|-| coh05uh || 5 || Kinda upset about Black Panther. Will his role be diminished now? He was basically replacing Spider-Man in the Civil War storyline. I love Spider-Man, but I rather see more Black Panther, since we haven't seen him at all at this point. |-| 
|-| cogvb2v || 9 || If it means getting Spidey into MCU I'd be willing to push back any sequel including Civil War, Guardians and yes Avengers however I'd like to see the new characters get developed sooner so there could be more reincorporation later. |-| 
|-| cogvcd5 || 9 || I love Spider Man. |-| 
|-| cogwxyp || 4 || Quite the ripple effect going on here. Lot's of potential for cameos, crossovers and guest appearances. |-| 
|-| coguhpf || 28 || Man, I really don't care for the Thor franchise. They're clearly the worst of the MCU movies, he's a rather stiff character, the supporting cast outside of Loki is uninteresting, and he doesn't add that much to the Avengers either outside of Loki's storyline. The other heroes just seem so much more interesting. |-| 
|-| cogwuij || 3 || I'm sure a lot of people will be disappointed that these movies have been pushed back but I think this is actually a good sign. To me this means Marvel will have more creative control over the Spider-man movie (despite what the news article said about Sony retaining creative control) and they are just trying to avoid spreading themselves too thin. |-| 
|-| cogyo3m || 9 || When you realise this means Batman and Superman now go up against Captain America, Iron Man AND Spider-Man.   |-|

 |-| 
|-| cogo7q6 || -13 || I don't mean to be a [dick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBYbzb1tUEQ), but it's a bad sign for the movie that the spoof of it's trailer is so boring that I quit watching as soon as I confirmed that, indeed, they just spliced in some random Buscemi quotes and shots.   |-| 
|-| cogsdlz || 26 || You know I think I had finally gotten over shaky cam.  Not so much that I came to like it, but I was no longer lying awake in bed at night seething over its existence.  I was no longer standing on my roof in the pouring rain, screaming at the night sky and cursing the gods that this was the current state of action movies.  I had come to accept that shaky cam was just going to be part of our lives now.  

Then I saw Taken 3.

Seriously fuck Olivier Megaton. Taken 3 had to have had, by far, the most outrageous number of abrupt and unnecessary cuts I've ever seen in a movie.  It was like he was trying to inspire the academy to create a "most cuts-per-minute in a feature length film" award category, and then win the inaugural Oscar himself.  Even the straight dialogue scenes with no action whatsoever made me feel like I was on the verge of having a schizophrenic breakdown. I was so disoriented by the time its 90 run time was over, I felt like there should have been a "do not drive or operate heavy machinery while under the influence of Taken 3" warning attached to the opening credits. 

Sorry I had to get that out of my system.

Rant aside, I don't always agree with Stuckmann's reviews but I gotta say I agree with him all the way through here.  The shaky cam is the obvious go to criticism, so I was glad that he went beyond it because the rest of his points were pretty dead on as well imo.  Keep up the good work Chris |-| 
|-| cogw3h3 || 8 || As another thing I'd add to this video's list, Action movies are in a horrible, horrible casting rut; they take either the known factor, even if it's known from 20 years ago, over an unknown actor because they're relying on the name to sell the movies rather than the quality of the movies.    
    

It's another factor along the line of the vulnerability of the hero that there haven't been any real newcomers to replace our old action movie heroes. They're using the same actors for these parts, guys who are obviously getting up in years, and having them do the same things they were in their action movies 20-30 years ago despite it just not being believable anymore. Arnold Schwarzenegger just can't believably play the same character types he did in the 80's and early 90's anymore, but he's still getting the parts. The only one I can think of that did even ok with this was Rambo where Stallone was still a badass but an older, smarter one rather than just the battering ram he was in earlier movies.      
 |-| 
|-| cogv8jz || 12 || I think he's put forward some fair points, but in the end, it all just comes down to blandness. Blandness in aesthetics, blandness in camera work, blandness in plot, blandness in lead and antagonist, blandness in tone, blandness in action. Action films of all kinds, from shoot 'em ups to superhero movies, are so similar and uninteresting that the slight aesthetic change of the Winter Soldier is enough for people to celebrate. |-| 
|-| cogsb6y || 28 || Damn. That was an incredibly well done and accurate commentary. |-| 
|-| cogt1x3 || 13 || You know everyday guys like this can put the work and create this great archetype of a movie genre, and then some guys get paid millions of dollars to make the same flawed movie. Hollywood brutally invests in the wrong people, I think it may be changing slowly but for now we continually get flawed movies. |-| 
|-| cogttpv || 10 || Great video,

I wish he talked a bit about Dredd as one of the best, more recent action flicks. |-| 
|-| cogz7vb || 4 || If you liked this video check out Tony Zhou's [Jackie Chan - How to Do Action Comedy](http://vimeo.com/113439313) it covers how fight scenes can but shot and edited mainly. Also about the differences between different countries studios allow for stunt work shots.  |-| 
|-| cogt63t || 7 || I suggest you watch the video at a 1.25 speed, it makes the video feel more energetic. I don't know why Chris doesn't use his "movie review" voice for these videos, because it's his passionate tone that makes me like his videos.  |-|

|-| cogkrl5 || 3 || Source? |-| 
|-| cogl25l || 4 || There's no new information, besides that Fox will make it. Carpenter will be an Exec Producer (which doesn't mean much) not Director. |-|

|-| cogpygp || 3 || He already did that. It was called Escape From LA and is was awesome. |-| 
|-| cogpjsw || 4 || I'd rather a sequel than a remake.

"Escape From America". Karl Urban as a new criminal reluctantly working for the government. 2 years after the black out in Escape From LA the US has been invaded and mostly taken over by a mix of European terrorist groups who capitalized on Snake's madness before anyone could get it together to protect themselves. The new President who ousted the former power hungry man gives Urban's character one last mission citing his brother who was ordered the death penalty before the black out will be a cleared man who he hasn't seen in months. He agrees. He's then sent in to take out several terrorist figure heads across America. Ending with him taking one the biggest figurehead on the outskirts of LA.

Upon completing his mission he realizes that his brother had already been killed months before the final mission was ordered. Betrayed by the new seemingly better President who is still a prick, he leaves a number of terrorists alive to regroup and continue terrorizing America. Eventually coming across a small bar along a forested area. He then bumps into Snake beside him who echoes what they've both done in the end was twisted justice but justice nonetheless. Clank their glasses with a toast and end the movie. |-|

|-| cogojh0 || 3 || I don't care who the next Snake is as long as he's not a current Hollywood cake-eater pretty boy.

Has a 4ft beard that stinks of liquor and shitty underwear.  MAN THE FUCK UP HOLLYWOOD.  |-|

|-| cog5vfp || 5 || Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen was great in Appaloosa, but I didn't enjoy the movie much. And I don't remember why but I really hated Renée Zellweger's character.

A lesser known one that I like is [Gunfighter's Moon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113238/). Makes me think that Lance Henriksen should've been in more Westerns, but dude seems to be more into sci-fi. |-|

|-| cog9uuo || 4 || The Assassination of Jesse James had one of the best soundtracks, it's worth watching for the music alone. I personally thought Appaloosa was pretty terrible, but coming off their last film "A History of Violence" my expectations were probably too high. |-|

For one, they have a bit of a diversity problem, so getting Glover would go some way towards fixing that. And an older Miles Morales would be cool to see in the MCU as well. We've seen enough Peter Parkers in the last few years. |-|

There are a lot of pre-'99 movies with middle-aged men finally maturing, and even more post-'99 ones, but those three, coming so close to each other and being so thematically similar yet with such different stories, really stand out as being a trio.  |-|

I'm not supposed to spoil too much, but the version we saw looked practically finished. Loved the production design on this film, and unlike most horror films, this film was incredibly colorful. And there was no way this film *wouldn't* get an R-rating. Plenty of violence and sex. The Hiddleston fans will really enjoy this one. |-|

|-| cog18oz || 18 || I was just thinking about this idea last night:

Cinematic universes are the thing right now.

Marvel has their universe, DC is building one, Sony is "trying" to build one for Spider-Man, Fox is rumored to be doing the same with X-Men and Fantastic Four, and Universal is trying to launch a cinematic monsters universe.

My thought was about completely unrelated properties.

Think about that leaked plan for an MIB/21 Jump Street crossover.

What if studios were to take multiple, unrelated properties for which they own the film rights and start to build new, unique cinematic universes?

Not that I'm saying that it would be a good idea, but imagine what Paramount could do by taking Transformers, TMNT, and Star Trek and patching all of them together. That's the sort of thing that I'm getting at (but, please, Paramount, don't ever do this). Those three properties are not connected in their source material at all, but their film rights are owned by the same studio.

I don't know if this is a "will never happen" idea, but it is an idea that's almost too risky for anyone to actually want. The response from the fans of each individual property would be so immensely negative and the execution would have to be so flawless that, if I were in charge, I'd rather save my effort and money than have such a large set of films fail commercially/critically. |-|

|-| cog4cnn || 5 || I'd love to see a movie in the Star Wars universe that didn't focus on the main storyline. Not like they are doing with the Boba Fett Spin off.  But like a rom-com, or a sci-fi action movie that just fleshes out one or a few of the planets.

Any genre-bending film I can appreciate. I loved "Your Highness" just for the comedic take on Fantasy. |-| 
|-| cofzfyl || 17 || The Catcher in the Rye |-| 
|-| cofz1ji || 4 || I'd like to see a movie of "This Book is Full of Spiders". The story is like a zombie parody that’s genuinely intense and suspenseful with a hilarious blend of dark and sarcastic comedy. The Zombie movie trend is wearing itself out, so it’s a perfect time to mock the format. It’s about an outbreak vs quarantine conflict where everyone mistakenly thinks the problem is zombies because zombies are so huge in pop culture. It’s hard to describe how awesome the movie is that exists in my head called “This Movie Is Full Of Spiders, Seriously Don’t Watch It”. |-| 
|-| cog24nz || 4 || A sequel to Frank. I loved the movie and the characters so much, and I'd love to see more about the Soronprfbs touring or something. I can't imagine how it'd work though, unfortunately.  |-|

|-| cofzt7u || 7 || A trilogy adaption of the [Mahabharata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata#Synopsis) with Hollywood production.  It would have to be massively streamlined, but I think it could be done and keep the epic *and* the philosophy intact.

First movie gives a two minute intro to Hinduism narration, and establishes the Kuru dynasty up to the ascension of the Pandavas and Kauravas.  Main plot goes until the establishing of Indraprastha and the cementing of Duryodhana's enmity.


Second movie comes in on the Pandavas ruling, and gives us the dice game, their exile and adventures and return, ending just before war.

Third movie is nothing but the Kurukshetra war with a 20 minute aftermath as the world turns to the final age of Kali Yuga.  You'd probably have to shift where the Gita takes place, as "this is the philosophical/religious point of the story" doesn't make sense happening at the beginning of the movie. Just have Arjuna's crises of faith be before the final day of combat instead of before the entire war.

I suppose it could be filmed and left for an extended edition where the point is to marathon all three movies.  In fact the story-within-a-story structure of the Mahabharata lends itself perfectly well to lots of extra scenes for extended editions. |-|
