|-| cntzaj9 || 56 || I'm an Organismal biologist, and have done multiple necropsies. These bones look much fresher than they should. Dermestid beetles used correctly would have left those bones clean. 

Another thing- if those are specimens stolen from a school, she could be in big trouble. 

Schools usually receive donated biological materials for study, but it's not appropriate for those materials to be taken home or stored in a students house. This is highly unethical and against the intention of whoever may have donated themselves for study.

|-| cntzd59 || 6 || Chocolate spaghetti? |-|

|-| cntzffl || 3 || It's called a Mermithidae or Atleast a similar parasite. I remember a video of a similar parasite leaving a praying mantis: (Not for the faint of heart, seriously). http://youtu.be/bcj0Srt8i6k

|-| cntzsai || 8 || When I was about 7 a medical student lived in the commune next door. The owner(who also lived there) had a bitchin CD collection (this was 1990 so that stuff was radical) he allowed me to come over and listen to them. Anyway, the medical student also had a homework box like this and she was studying them. I started sorting out the bones by shades of colour. Asked her if each shade is a different person. She said yeah. There were 7 different shades. It only creeped me out years later. |-|

|-| cnu2ax4 || 5 || i once used a tarantula as bait while i was bass fishing in a creek. after i got a hit i reeled it back in and saw one of these pink bastards hanging out of the spider. at the time i thought it was just spider guts :| |-|

|-| cnu2rrw || 3 || WTF man, I can only assume its cheaper to give each student real skeleton v. a fake one. |-| 
|-| cnu3diq || 63 || You know something is vile and evil if it makes you feel bad for a spider. |-| 
|-| cnu3fru || 7 || Very odd because the bones are in such terrible condition. You use the bone box to study from and these are damaged and degraded. The skull is in especially terrible shape, which is unusual since skulls are almost always fake. They're the most expensive part if they're real, so usually people just get high-quality fakes.

Also, you don't need a whole skeleton. The point is to get a sense of each bone or typical bone, so you only need one femur, one tibia, one hand, one thoracic vertebra, etc. You also don't get all the ribs since 2-8 are generally the same.

Anyway, she's probably a mass murderer given the state of those bones. |-|

I found out he was bringing pieces upstairs to study when our 3year old son was looking under our bed skirt and said"Hey, there's somebody down here". I looked underneath the bed to see a skull grinning at us. Didn't phase my son a bit. Luckily he grew up to be a functional, well adjusted adult with a great sense of humor. |-| 
|-| cnuh577 || 3 || More than likely the spider ate a cricket or cockroach that had a smaller version of this worm in it. Once inside the spider, it can grow much longer. I thought they only could grow 10cm inside the spiders, but this one sure looks longer than that! |-|

Then you can put the bones in vinegar and they will be realy soft, get a mixer that you destroy after it, mix all bones, and then put them again in washpowder on 37 celsius, and then dry it and mix it with bleach, just dig a hole in the woods, as deap as you can, it just needs to be deep, not big, and then flush everything in the hole.

Nobody ever will find anything, no Dna, nothing, its just imposibil to get anything out of it, or even find it, not with experts, not with dogs that can sniff it, nothing, it is one forever.
After this wash everything you used with bleach, and throw the mixer away in a trashcan from someone else in another town.

No body, no murder. They will never find anything to begin with, so they won´t search for anything.

|-| cnv98yv || 6 || the thing is the movie just doesn't keep up with the hype that was planned out which originally was just a weird guy doing weird things to a dude because he could. 

according to reviews and braver souls who have seen the movie the first act is stellar, right on the mark with everything the story needed to be super successful, then the second act changes the genre completely with the introduction of johnny depp's character and leads to a less successful ending. 

There was a shoe horned back story for the weird dude doing his weird things to the guy, but instead of giving it actual justification or greater depth, its more like he has his a sticky note of reasons for mutilating random humans. 


Overall may get better since this is the first in a trilogy of weird tales of the north and probably good to see if your into body mutilation and stressing your senses.  |-|

|-| cnxol3m || 7 || I live in Marion Indiana... Here, to be more specific:

http://www.castleproperty.net


http://www.journalofamericanhistory.org/teaching/2011_06/sources/day2ex1_photo_madison.html
&gt; The Castle is the former Grant County jail and sheriff’s residence. 

&gt; On a hot August night in 1930 a crowd gathered in front of an Indiana jail—men, women, and children shouting and jeering, demanding that the sheriff release his three prisoners. Three African American teenagers—Tom Shipp, Abe Smith, and James Cameron—huddled inside their cells, charged with the murder of a white man and the rape of white woman. Some among the thousands of people in front of the jail formed a mob. They beat down the jail doors, pulled the three youths from their cells, brutally beat them, and dragged them to a tree on the courthouse square. At the last minute the mob spared Cameron, the youngest and most boyish of the trio. Smith and Shipp died, lynch ropes around their necks, their bodies hanging as the town photographer captured one of the most famous lynching photographs in American history.

I live in the remodeled jail cell where they were held.

Our first night there we slept on an air mattress in the "guest room" which was actually the original master room (the second bedroom was added in the 60s). My fiance woke me up in the middle of the night panicked about a man she saw in the corner of the room in coveralls with a patched name tag of "Bill" who vanished as she moved up on the matress. A couple years later an older couple of ladies stopped by the house they grew up in and described their father William who had worked at the cotton mill and died in the house.

I swear as real as I am touching these keys that handle swapped sides and I screamed for hours. Its one of maybe 3 very vivid memories from that age.

The funeral home I worked in was big on respect for the deceased, and I'm fairly sure a picture like this would get some hardcore disciplinary action from whatever council/board has you in their jurisdiction.

One night there was a robbery at the furniture store across the parking lot from us. The morning after police came to our apartment to ask if we had seen or heard anything. After answering that we knew nothing just as they were about to leave one of the officers looks around and chuckles. 

He says "man, the last time I was here a guy had his girlfriend tied to a chair in that room (nods towards room mate with gf's room), covered her in gasoline and lit her up. It was awful." 

I couldn't believe he said that... It creeped me the fuck out but I was glad it wasn't my room. Im not sure if I was more weirded out by what had happened or by the way he explained it with a chuckle. We moved shortly after.

And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar;
And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: "Please close that door.

You have to go in about half way through and break up the skull and pull the chest cavity toward the main burner so it would burn faster. Bigger people went in feet first, small people went in head first cuz the main burner is by the door and it allowed the body to burn faster.....you get used to the smell but the sizzling is a different story. |-| 
|-| cny1eah || 5 || my friend is a realtor.  he took a client to see a house.  she went upstairs, he walked around the main floor and then went down to the basement.  he got to a back bedroom and a wicked chill went through him.  he just booked it upstairs and went out to the car.  

eventually, the client came out and was asking what happened.  halfway through the question she asked, "my god, are you ok?!"  he was sheet-white and shivering in warm sunlight.  "we gotta go!" was all he could muster.

he didn't try to explain.  he dropped her off then went home.  he slept from 5:00 in the evening until 7:00 the next morning.

all he shared with me was "something bad was down there."

|-| cny5t3f || 3 || It is creepy ... as an expert in luminous artifacts, some of that lighting is difficult for even me to explain away. |-|

|-| cog6jvz || 21 || Your girlfriend is amazing i would kill to get my hands on a nice lament configuration |-| 
|-| cog9g02 || 79 || Is this something only the cool kids understand? Because I'm totally out of the loop here about what this is and why it's creepy (and not just unique/cool) |-| 
|-| cogig5g || 9 || &gt;...It is desire.

Solved the riddle. It's a dick-in-a-box. |-| 
|-| cogb9pl || 16 || The box...you opened it, we came. |-| 
|-| coggoy6 || 8 || Your girlfriend is an Angel, or a Nightmare, depending...

|-| cog84z4 || 18 || Jesus, she could just say that she wants to break up. There is no need to torture and kill you.  |-| 
|-| cogiqsw || 5 || Very cool! A guy on reddit made one a couple weeks ago. [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/somethingimade/comments/2sh128/i_made_a_replica_of_the_hellraiser_box_the_lament/) |-|

|-| cogpx15 || 4 || If I understood that movie correctly, I think this means she wants experiment with BDSM. |-| 
|-| cogqrp0 || 4 || How will she wrap you for the Cenobites? |-| 
|-| cogcyfm || 3 || That's awesome! I introduced my boyfriend to hellraiser a few months back he loved it |-| 
|-| cogfd85 || 3 || Dude, have you not seen Hellseeker?

I'd worry about anyone giving me that. 

Just remember, when he turns up, offer him 5 souls for your own. |-| 
|-| coghoqc || 3 || You've got quite a treasure there in that ~~Horadric Cube~~ girlfriend |-| 
|-| cogi68d || 4 || Maybe she just wants you to know she loves you and she literally summoned it from the depths of hell to show you that. Now, go start that rapture like you guys always planned. The time is now to show her that you will stop at nothing to command the armies of hell for her. True luff. |-| 
|-| cogiy9p || 4 || That is a sweet Lament Configuration!!!  |-| 
|-| cogo6vf || 3 || I watched all 8 (or was it 9?) of the movies and enjoyed every one.

They're not scary films, but they're damn fun. |-| 
|-| cogqepe || 3 || You marry that girl right now.

Not because she's marriage material, but because you're so gruesomely dead if you don't.  She is not someone you ever, EVER leave.

Look, I'm going to level with you--- Your life isn't going to end well.  You're looking at some pretty bleak choices here.   I'm just saying a life of constant fear and looking over your shoulders is the best alternative here.  

The only other alternative I can think of is if you happen to know some serious people whome you can turn State on and enter the witness protection program.  You might get whacked eventually, but that's likely better than the alternative.

Best of luck mate!   |-|

|-| cogipo7 || 3 || My god what a great movie. I remember back in my early college days my friends and I would spend time just walking around to different parties in groups. We would show up unannounced sometimes and somebody would usually say "why are you here?" To which I would answer "you solved the box, we came." those were some good memories. Cool gift man. |-|
