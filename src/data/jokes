While he is there with pants down and back against the tree he nods off. His hunting buddies get a deer and go look for him. They find him out cold against the tree. They decide to put the gut pile from the deer under him and go back to camp. While sitting drinking coffe they hear a scream in the woods. Some time later their buddy comes running into camp screaming "Guys you wont believe it. I just shit my guts out" Trying not to laugh they ask what he did about it. He says, "By the grace of God and a long stick I got them all back in" |-|

Including another in-bed classic:

A man and his wife went to bed. After laying in bed for a few minutes the man let a total ripping fart go.

The wife rolled over and growled, “What the heck was that?”

Martin said, “TOUCHDOWN. I’m ahead, 7 to nothing!”

A few minutes later the wife let a fly-killing zinger go.

Martin gasped, “What was that?”

She replied, “Touchdown. Tie score.”

Martin lay quietly in bed for 5 minutes, trying to work up a really big one. Before he knew it, something happened – he pushed so hard he crapped the bed.

The wife asked, “What in the world was that?”

He replied, “Halftime – time to switch sides.” |-|

|-| cnvmvwy || -5 || A man and woman had been married for more than 60 years. They had shared everything. They had talked about everything. They had kept no secrets from each other except that the little old woman had a shoe box in the top of her closet that she had cautioned her husband never to open or ask her about.
For all of these years, he had never thought about the box, but one day the little old woman got very sick and the doctor said she would not recover.
In trying to sort out their affairs, the little old man took down the shoe box and took it to his wife’s bedside. She agreed that it was time that he should know what was in the box. When he opened it, he found two crocheted dolls and a stack of money totaling $95,000. He asked her about the contents.
‘When we were to be married,’ she said, ‘ my grandmother told me the secret of a happy marriage was to never argue. She told me that if I ever got angry with you, I should just keep quiet and crochet a doll.’
The little old man was so moved; he had to fight back tears. Only two Precious dolls were in the box. She had only been angry with him two Times in all those years of living and loving. He almost burst with Happiness.
‘Honey,’ he said, ‘that explains the doll, but what about all of this money? Where did it come from?’
‘Oh,’ she said, ‘that’s the money I made from selling the dolls.’ |-|

|-| cnvobyk || 9 || I have been in apt. maintenance for years.  90% of the time if you draw over the permanent marker with dry-erase marker, wait for a second,and wipe away with cotton rag it will remove it.  The chemicals that make the dry-erase removable also do the same on the permanent inks. Next, take a paint sample to your local hardware store and get a" sample size" matched. It is usually about 1/2 pint,and only costs about $5 instead of 30+. Hope This helps. |-|

My eldest son is now twenty years older, but.... when he was just a tyke he came out of the den one day *covered* in marker.  On his tongue (!) his teeth, around his eyes, circles on his face.  His hands were covered.

I just had to laugh after I calmed my wife down.  

Then, what about the den?  The computer is in there!

Every single key on the keyboard.  All around the screen and circles and squares everywhere on it.  There was no getting that off.

I am typing on the keyboard - now a lot cleaner from all the years.  The old tube I only retired a few years ago.  I loved them both for the classic moment it reminded me of a little boy lost in his creativity.

And, the reminder to never, ever leave out those kinds of things again!

Love the memory.  It is a classic. |-|

And it's no good leaving it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover, now is it? I hear the best thing to do is feed him to pigs. You got to starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped-up body will look like curry to a pisshead. You gotta shave your kid's head, and pull the teeth out for the sake of the piggies' digestion. You could do this afterwards, of course, but you don't want to go sieving through pig shit, now do you? They will go through bone like butter. You need at least eight pigs to finish the job in one sitting, so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm. They will go through a body that weighs 30 pounds in about 2 minutes. That means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute. Hence the expression, "as greedy as a pig". |-|

People usually pour a gallon or two of gasoline on the carpet, over the affected area. Then you lit the match and throw it on the gasoline. 

The chemical reaction of gasoline with the blood will cause to turn it into carbon, which is easier to remove. This will also work with the green permanent markings on the living room. 

You might get a temporary smell of BBQ in your house for a while. 

Good luck. |-|

Caffeine allergy is a thing (altered/clarified comment+cleaned first edit). So this joke could hypothetically be real (coffee break thing aside) edit3:Since this is continuing to get downvotes, let me clarify: I find the military guy admirable, because I know theres no way I could make it without coffee. Boot camp was hell because we woke up at 4 and stayed up 4 extra hours a week for a certain task(we had bad sleeping habits too... &gt;.&gt;). No caffeine allowed.

Sheila gave that grin she always gave when she'd won an argument.  But Paul wasn't buying it this time.  "Sheila, you think I'm stupid or something?  That's Kevin from accounting!  And now you're both going to burn in hell!!"

Paul ran to the hall and grabbed a can of gasoline.  He began dousing the bed generously and grabbed a box of matches.

"No!  Please, don't do this!", yelled Kevin.

"He's right, Paul!  You're drunk, don't do this!", exclaimed Sheila.

Paul stood ready to burn them all to a char when the pleas continued.

"Paul, we'll do anything!!", Kevin supplicated.

"Anything!", Sheila continued.  "What do you want????!!!  We'll give it to you!!!"

"Anything??!!", Paul asked.

"Yes, please don't do this!!!" they yelled.

"Alright, I'm gonna need about tree fiddy." Paul calmly responded.  

Well, it was about that time that Sheila's suspicions about Paul were right all along.  Why, they'd barely met and got married on a whim.  Curious that they'd met, had their first kiss, made their first love, and got engaged in the same spot: the loch.  

In fact, the gasoline didn't smell like gasoline at all.  It smelled of the loch.  She jumped out of bed and yanked Paul's wig and glasses off.  Sure enough, it was that pesky Loch Ness Monster. |-|

i remembered when i posted this joke about two weeks ago

i see you copied it nearly word for word.

its still funny though

...although there is ONE difference from when i posted it, the "man" was "protestor" in my version (I included this joke in a series of jokes making fun of those furgussen looters/protestor types). |-| 
|-| co0feg3 || 59 || If they're so intellectually superior, why couldn't they come up with an original joke? |-| 
|-| co0fzx9 || 31 || The swedes and the norwegians are going to to have their third annual ice fishing contest. The previous years the Norwegians have won spectacularly. This year the swedes are determined and have bought the best equipment, made their own specialised bait and even set up a rotation plan to maximise fishing time.  They go out on the ice and look for a good spot and the two teams set up on opposite sides of a small forested island as before and they begin. The swedes have little luck, but they can hear the norwegians shout and cheer as if they're getting plenty of fish. After some time the swedes have still not caught a single fish and are becoming increasingly frustrated. Finally they decide to send Sven over the little island to spy on the Norwegians to see if they can figure out their secret. Sven trudges up the island and disappears into the trees. The swedes continue to fish unsuccessfully. After a while Sven bursts out of the trees while shouting "The Norwegians have drilled holes in the ice!!!" |-| 
|-| co0elxd || 13 || It's like that '3 blondes in a bar' joke |-| 
|-| co0gzpb || 4 || So intellectually superior yet can't come up with their own jokes

|-| co92jzi || 297 || as a bipolar person, i've always enjoyed telling people "bipolar isn't that bad. in fact, half the time it's fucking awesome."

edit: Hey guys! i love the feed back! but just to clarify for folks, yes, it is not accurate. i say "half" cuz it works better comedically. I hope all of you have wonderful days! :) |-| 
|-| co98rgt || 42 || Being bipolar is like owning your own personal roller coaster without the fun.  |-| 
|-| co9bp3x || 67 || I have alzheimers, but at least i don't have alzheimers. |-| 
|-| co9chu8 || 57 || I hate "being" bipolar. Because I'm not actually Bipolar. I'm a normal person, who lives with Bipolar. But no, I'm not Bipolar. I heard someone ask once, what if we talked about people with cancer the way we do bipolar/other mental illnesses. When you say someone IS bipolar not suffering/living/coping with same, you're effectively pointing at them and saying " You are your illness". 
Example using the above joke; I hate being cancer, it's great..
Oh, she's grouchy because she's cancer. He's depressed because he's cancer. 

Your illness isn't who you are, it's only a slice of what you have to offer. Could we just stop walking around and speaking without thinking.

Oh and just so no one sees this comment as some vigilante joke ruiner for the sake of harping on about something I deem valid and important; I love poking fun at my mental illness. If I didn't I would cry. |-| 
|-| co92j4p || 366 || I have multiple personality disorder, this joke made me be thankful for not being bipolar.
