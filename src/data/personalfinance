|-| cntvt5n || 4 || Find out what the car is actually worth on the open market (KBB etc.) . If I had to guess, $8k is perhaps a little low, but not much. I would bet it's surely underwater.

All that to say you will not save any money in the long run trading "up" to a newer more expensive car. 

Pay it down/off. If you want to switch to a smaller car like a civic of roughly the same value, and furthermore do it with actual cash money or you'll just go through the depreciation and underwater trap again.

 |-| 
|-| cntvura || 25 || I'm having a bit of trouble following what exactly is going on here.

So you've got a CR-V (worth $8k) and a loan for $14.5k(presumably rolled some debt from the Cobalt over to the CR-V loan)?

I'd assume that the 2012 Civic is worth more than your CR-V.  So, you'd be increasing your debt by moving to the Civic.  How on earth would increasing your debt lead to a lower payment, unless they want to stretch out the term of your loan?

My initial reaction is that you'd be way better off sticking with the CR-V for as long as you can.  Then again, your story doesn't totally make sense to me, so maybe I'm missing something. |-| 
|-| cntvvq1 || 10 || Well they're not lying, but it's nearly universal that car salesman talk in terms of monthly payments, which is the wrong way to look at how much something costs. I can go get a new Mercedes for a lower monthy payment than a Ford Fiesta by using a 72-month term and a down payment instead of 36-month term with nothing down.

The best way to think of it is this, because it's financially equivalent to your situation:

You owe $14,500 to a friend for things completely unrelated to cars.  But note your friend is a stickler and demands monthly payments so there's no weaseling out - you're definitely in debt. You also don't have a car, and your choices are a $8,000 CRV or a 2012 Civic for whatever they're selling it for. The Civic will entail sales tax, higher insurance, and maybe registration whereas the CRV won't. Which would you rather buy? |-| 
|-| cntvw20 || 6 || &gt;Is there any merit to their argument, or am I better off sucking it up and attempting to pay off the CRV?

Its probably a shitty deal for you. They're going to roll your negative equity into the new loan, so if the car costs $10k, your loan is going to be for $16.5k.  They're also gouging you on the interest rate (likely to make up for the increased risk of an upside down car loan). |-|

|-| cntw6qn || 24 || Earned Income Tax Credit is a credit designed for low-income people.  In the US tax system, many people at the bottom of the ladder get back more money than they pay in.   For 2014 taxes, if you are single, with one child, you are eligible for a tax credit of $3,305 if your income is under $38,511.   

It's unclear why your mom wouldn't want to claim the tax credit.  

Claiming a dependent means you are telling the government that you provide the majority of support and care for that dependent.  It can have a lot of consequences tax wise, and even some other outside complications.  It might be smart to talk to someone about it, either a tax advisor or other tax professional.

Also, the check for your brother is survivor benefits, it will stop when he gets to either 18 or 21, depending on a few circumstances. |-| 
|-| cntw70t || 5 || I'd bet she's talking abut the [*earned* income credit](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/EITC,-Earned-Income-Tax-Credit,-Questions-and-Answers) since I haven't heard of the other one. But in that scenario, you would claim your brother by declaring that you take care of over half of his expenses, and then you get a credit for that. If you aren't providing half of his support, then of course you can't claim him, so don't lie. Also, if you are a dependent, you can't claim the EIC anyway. |-| 
|-| cntw7cy || 3 || Yes, it's possible for collections agencies to work with you. They will be happy to pull money from your debt. Call them and see what you can work out.

To rebuild your credit, a secured credit card is the way to go. Put a small purchase on it and pay it off every month. A good payment history with responsible spending will improve your credit. 

I don't think you can get a loan, or a good loan, with your husband's credit score. |-|

|-| cntwhfd || 77 || Don't worry about savings for now.  Gather up a couple thousand dollars.  Then contact your creditors.  Say something like this.

"Okay, I read this statement and it seems like you think I owe you $1200.  Is that correct?"  .... Yes .....

"All right.  I've been scraping together some money and I've got $600.  That's all I've got.  I can pay you that right now, in exchange for you considering the debt paid in full, and reporting it paid off entirely to the credit bureaus.  Can we make that deal?  Great!  Send me a letter laying out that deal and I'll pay you immediately."

They will take it.  If they don't want to take it, just say, "Okay, well, I'm not going to pay you at all then.  I'll pay some of my other creditors instead and you'll get nothing.  Are you sure you don't want to make this deal?"

Then proceed through all your other creditors, offering each less than the face value of the debt.  I personally would offer half.  If the debts are actually in collections, the collections people paid like 10%, so anything more than that is profit for them.

This strategy should deal with the debts in relatively short order, and then you can put $1000 in a certificate of deposit (locked in at the bank) and get a credit card with a $1000 limit (no risk to bank, they can take the CD if you don't pay the credit card).  After one or two years you can change the secured card to a regular card and get your $1000 back.

From there, just act as normal - pay your debts on time, and your credit rating will recover.

|-| cntwjin || 3 || I assume by "claim" you mean "claim as a dependent".  What she's asking you to do is probably immoral, but possibly not illegal.  If you do claim him, you will likely save yourself somewhere between $500-$800 in taxes, depending on your bracket. 

There are five requirements for claiming someone as a dependent.  They must be a relative (brother counts), they must live with you, they must have an income of less than $3,950 in this year, you must provide over 50% of their financial support, and they must not be claimed on anyone else's return.

I'm guessing that you don't provide financial support for your brother.  It sounds like SSI does that.  In the event that you do provide financial support for him, and your mother is not claiming him, you can (and should) claim him as a dependent.  

--- (more)

Reading again, I caught the phrase "Unearned income credit", which I'm assuming is referring to the "Earned Income Tax Credit" (EITC).  This is another benefit to having children that specifically applies to lower tax brackets.  Here, the requirements are similar to claiming your brother as a dependent.  You must have less than $38,511 in earned income to claim this credit, and one requirement that sticks out is you cannot be someone else's qualifying child.  This means if your mother plans to claim you to get her EITC, you cannot claim your brother to get EITC.  

-- (summary)

Soo, looks like it ultimately comes down to two questions:  1.  Are you comfortable taking the credit, saying you provided for your brother?  Support is very difficult to prove, so if you feel comfortable saying you supported him, it'll probably be sufficient.  2.  Do you know your mother isn't going to screw you by claiming you or double-claiming your brother?  If you answered "yes" to both of these questions, claim your credits and enjoy the large tax refund!  |-| 
|-| cntwrnq || -7 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| cntwt32 || 82 || You have to read the IRS rules for who you can claim as a dependant.  In particular, you must be supporting yourself AND providing more than half of the support for the dependant, counting everything.  [EDIT: see response below.]

If this is true, great.  If it isn't, you can't claim him and should not.  

&gt; She's taken advantage of me financially before.

You are 18 and are legally responsible for yourself.  You must not file false documents with the government, even if your mother wants you to; she won't get in trouble, you will.  So read the IRS rules and follow them.

Also, just as general life advice: you need to disentangle your finances from your mother's.  Open your OWN bank account somewhere and have your paychecks deposited there.  Then - if you're still living with your mother - you can give her some, but not all of your pay, as your contribution to the household while you're living there.  But the important part is that you are in control of the money, not her.  At some point you will want to move out and she will not want to let you or your paycheck go.

When you rent a property to someone, you must change your homeowners policy to the "rental" version. This is usually slightly cheaper than a personal homeowners policy. This covers theft and damage to your property.

A renter's insurance policy is something your tenant should get on his own, and it protects his personal property while renting from you. It is not required. |-|

Your cell phone bill is far too high. Do you need unlimited service and 6 GB of data??? Doubt it.

It sucks to need to buy expensive Internet to get out of bandwidth caps, I can understand why that feels necessary, but if you have that you can put your phone on wifi.

You need to figure out where the rest of your money is disappearing to. Then save up an emergency fund, then enough to overcome the negative car loan equity and get into something cheaper. |-| 
|-| cnty684 || 6 || A few thoughts. What are you paying for rent?

Your poor credit is probably part of the reason your car insurance quotes are so high. That is based off credit.

Your phone bill is outrageous. $110 is still entirely too high for one phone. I pay $50 a month for T-Mobile with unlimited talk/text/data (though only 1GB is high speed data) and I know there are lower plans than that. You should be able to cut your phone bill in half, easily.

Your car payment is also incredibly high. You can sell your car and buy something much cheaper. This may lower your insurance as a side effect or it may not, depending on what you drive now and what you get.

You're not including any budgeted amounts for food/gas/medicine/clothes/toiletries/etc.

What problem are you having starting out with YNAB? You should be able to enter your starting balances and go from there. It guides you through that. You should be aware that it doesn't budget money you don't have yet, so you will be negative until you have money to actually pay your bills. |-|

It sounds like she kind of checked out on the whole parental thing (for whatever reason, no judgements here) and is pushing more responsibility onto you. You mentioned somewhere that she makes you feel like it's "your fault" he can't get free lunches anymore, and that she's already taken advantage of you. That's really not high class mom material, and is generally not the kind of thing a rational supportive adult would ever say to an 18 year old, let alone, their own kid.  

If she's pushing you to claim him make sure that 
A) she doesn't claim him too (cause you'll both get nailed for that). Ask for a copy of her taxes when she files, or file hers with her to be sure. No offense intended, just consider it one way to protect yourself from anything nefarious. 

and 

B) Don't let her try to bully you for any money you do get back. Set it aside for household expenses (bills, food, emergency fund, etc) and that's it. 

C) For actual filing, it would be highly worth your time to talk to a proper tax consultant/preparer to work through the legality of it. 

It's a shitty thing to do, but try to make sure you keep a paper trail. For example: save stubs for bills you've paid (you can usually get copies online too, or from the company itself if you contact them), anything you've bought for your brother, and copies of any texts/emails she may have sent urging you to claim him. 

Best case, you don't need it and your mom really is trying to help. Worst case, she tries something funny (like double claiming your bro) and you can shut it down because you've got evidence.

|-| cntymjc || 12 || Advice:

* Figure out where the $506 dollars is going.  It did not disappear on its own.  My guess is gasoline, rent, water bill, and food since you don't have line items for them in your post.  Figure this out and repost so your whole budget is available.

*  Your electric bill:  Sign up for the thing where they average it out over the year and you pay the average each month, so you don't have this budget problems in the summer.  

* That car payment is crazy high.  It is over 25% of your take home income!  Do you need a car?  Can you do public transportation?   Do you need a $15,000 car?  Can you trade it in on a less expensive but reliable used car and try to negotiate a better APR?  

* Overall you need to get your budget complete so you can figure out what money, if any, you have to pay down your debts.  After doing a complete budget, you will be able to figure out what discretionary income you have.  

Come back here with that information, and list out all of your debts with the rate of interest, and get advice on how to go about paying things off.  Once you are rid of any bad debt (like the 6.9% APR car payment) you can establish a small emergency fund safety net and then start for retirement or whatever.

Good luck! |-|

$6100 in Debt, $1800 CC and loan. 

* How old are the debts? The date of each debt is important and helps to guide the advice on how to manage it.

* What state do you live in?

* What correspondence have the collection agencies sent you? How old are their letters? 

* Have you agreed to anything with them at all? 

* Are they calling you or harassing you in any way? 

* Are these your debts, your SO's debts, or joint (married debts)?

* Have you pulled a recent credit report?

It is possible to clear your debts. To negotiate with those creditors whom you can't immediately remove from your credit report. It is possible to arrange a deal to pay them in exchange for them deleting it all together. But the way you approach the situation must reflect the details not included. People have to be careful how they approach things and what they commit to doing, or they can end up with a non-optimal outcome.

|-| cntzx50 || 4 || Others have commented on the concept negative equity, loan calculations, etc.  

My personal opinion: stop rolling negative equity into another car loan. You've already done it once (going from Cobalt to CRV), I wouldn't do it again. 

My suggested option:
Keep you current car and pay off the loan completely. You might be able to refinance the loan at a lower interest rate but not sure since you only have like 55% equity in your car loan. Car dealers (and you yourself) will try to manipulate the numbers to make a new car purchase make sense (perhaps even convince yourself you'll save money)... But you won't. Just pay off the loan, then keep the car after payments are done (best option) or sell it privately and buy a new/used car with a new car loan (you have great credit so a great rate should be easy to get). 

Good luck.  |-| 
|-| cnu00kz || 3 || If I'm understanding your question correctly, it sounds like your relatives are occupying one of your properties while you also have your own home that you reside in. This is a tenant occupied property and you absolutely need to convert your homeowners insurance into a **landlord** insurance policy. You are a landlord regardless of whether you are collecting rent from them or not. It also does not matter that they are your relatives. It could be your children living in the property, and it would still be regarded as a tenant occupied property, requiring a landlord policy instead of a regular homeowners.

This was a very big issue during hurricane Sandy when a lot of people kept their homeowners insurance and did not bother to convert it into a landlord policy even though it was not owner occupied because 1. it was more expensive often times, 2. they neglected to think about it, or 3. they thought all of the damages to their home would be covered because their son or daughter was living there.

However, if you are also living in that same property with your relatives, you can keep your homeowners insurance the way it is and have your relatives take something out called renters insurance. Renters insurance will protect their belongings in case of a peril and also provide them with liability coverage. |-|

 |-| 
|-| cnu0gzp || -5 || I'm 24 and also from NJ with similar expenses minus the car payment (I drive an old beater car that is paid off), I honestly feel you are living somewhat outside of your means.... that's what I would change first to free up some budgeting room. The rent is normal for NJ so that's hard to escape, but is having a car with that high of a payment worth it to you?
If you can free up your budget a bit then make a higher contribution to your 401k, and make it a Roth 401k if that is an option for tax reasons when you go to take that money out many years down the road. You want to save at minimum 15% of your paycheck towards retirement and it's best to start early. When you want to buy a house and establish a family you'll be glad you already have something saved away to build on.

I'm fortunate to have started off well with a job and whatnot. When I was hired at 23 I started off at $70k base with a good bonus range; for 401k I do a Roth and my employer matches 100% of my first 4% contribution and 75% of my next 4% contribution, so essentially if I contribute 8% my employer will fully match 7% to get me at my 15% savings. I suggest trying to get yourself to this 15% 401k savings threshold, you will be happy you did when you're 50-60 to avoid a midlife crisis.

As a side note to why I started so high with salary, I have a dual masters (business and science)... however I'm also about $90k in debt which I am now paying off at $1,400 per month (the more I make the more I will pay into this to avoid interest) to get it paid off in 5 years (fingers crossed)! |-|

Example: If your normal tax refund (claiming only yourself, filing Single) will be $300, but claiming your brother as a dependent and status as Head of Household, your refund will be $1000. She will probably want you to give her the difference, in this example $700 (all arbitrary numbers).

|-| cnu2wov || 6 || Tax preparer here: your instincts serve you well op. There is no such thing as "unearned income credit," there is an "earned income credit," which could be several thousand dollars. However, you must have a job and have worked to earn it. Passive income such as SSI, dividends, and interest from banks do not count at all. 

For you to get the earned income credit, you must have met strict criteria. For one, you must have taken care of your brother for over half the year and he must live in YOUR (not your mothers) home for over half the year. The IRS will also wonder where your father is and you must have a good explanation for why he isn't claiming your brother. There are other criteria, but you can PM me for help figuring it out if you'd lie, to know if you qualify. It just sounds like you don't and your mother has no idea what she's talking about.

The IRS takes EIC fraud very seriously. If you're caught, you could be forced to pay back the refund, plus penalties and interest. In addition, you could be banned from legitimately claiming the earned income credit for up to 10 years. Then again, if you're entitled to that tax credit on your brother then you should absolutely take it. |-| 
|-| cnu2xic || 8 || I'm also interestred in this as we are pretty much in the exact identical situation.  I've been reading up on Dave Ramsey, as my brother and wife are firm believers in his books and they are 30's with a nice nice house and vehicles - debt free.

|-| cnu3cbr || 15 || Return the car.  This is a classic bait and switch tactic that I have seen numerous times.  The idea is to hook you with the car, make you think you are good, then pull it all out from under you so fast that you don't think twice about how badly you are getting screwed, and just agree to whatever they say.  The only thing that surprises me is it was Honda that did it.

Also don't pay them a fucking cent when you return the car.  This is 100% their fault for letting you drive off the lot with it.  Seriously this is the "catch" that they build in that is designed to get you to keep the car with worse financing terms. |-| 
|-| cnu3cpm || 4 || Cannot stress this enough: Get it in writing. Any pay schedule or detail like paying your debt in order to get it removed needs to be included.  If the agreement doesnt state the debt will be removed from your credit it will still be listed as late, but "paid." Showing as paid is more positive than just debt, but not as positive as not being there at all.

Also, **little known fact:** if you settle a debt and you pay an amount that is more than $600 less than the claimed debt amount (ie Your total debt listed on your credit is $1000 and it is settled for $399) the creditor is allowed to file that as "income" for you and you can receive a 1099. 

...only know this because I now owe back taxes from settling a credit card debt, and never receiving a 1099. &gt;.&gt; (Apparently not common, but totally legal.) My old boss used to do tax prep and had never heard of that before because it's so rare. |-|

I suggest pre-manufactured modern on the infill lot of your choice. Two months living expenses in cash is adequate especially if you have 35K in 401K and IRA; that 30K extra is not earning interest, value or dividends so its not compounding and it should be. The interest you are earning is being offset by the student loans. Dump the loans asap. The rate does not matter. NO DEBT! |-|

2. A simple way that you could strengthen your plan is by creating a budget for each paycheck you receive. For example, if you get paid 4000 per pay check, then give every cent a job: 1500 rent, 200 car, 800 save, 400 tithe etc. You need to be more specific with your goals and a budget will help you track your money to reach your goals. |-|

|-| cnu5iop || 3 || The most important thing about this scenario is how much house you're wanting. Related: how much is your expected down payment?

When you buy a house, debt-to-income shouldn't be higher than about 30% (give or take). You're quite a bit higher than that. I'd probably want to see about $10,000 in debt paid off before applying for a mortgage.

If your student loans are higher interest rates than the auto loans, I'd pay them down first (although to be honest, $35k may mean you want to downgrade your cars a little too...that's tolerable but not ideal). Vice versa if the car loans have a higher interest rate.

All this is moot, however, if paying this stuff down doesn't leave you with 20% mortgage down payment. Given your income, I expect your market price to be around $250k, which means you'd need about $50k for the down payment. 

Long story short, I think you're a good $10,000 away from being ready to buy a home no matter what the details of your situation are.

|-| cnu6360 || 8 || I'm in about the same position as you, and your plan looks very solid. 

As far as the Roth vs. Traditional 401K, I would personally suggest opening the traditional 401K. First, you'll want some taxable income in retirement, because the first $10K or so of income is tax free (exemption and standard deduction). You're not allowed to take deductions for a traditional IRA at your income level, so the only way you can do that is through the traditional 401K. 

Secondly, even if you still want to keep the majority of your retirement savings in a post tax account (Roth), you're a prime candidate for backdoor Roth contributions. Basically, you open a traditional IRA, make contributions, then immediately roll them over into a Roth IRA. Normally this is a problem for a lot of people, because if you already have a traditional IRA it becomes much more complicated. Since you don't, it doesn't make much of a difference. 

I would definitely make sure that you're saving at least 10% of your gross overall toward retirement before you worry about more immediate goals. |-|

|-| cnu781y || 7 || My wife and I both did this after graduating college. We left college with about $2000 in student loans between us, our two cars, and our dog, and maybe $1000 cash in both of our bank accounts. We both had essentially zero income during college and were forced to live *extremely* frugally. The kind of frugal where our rent was $150 per person per month, and eating was often a struggle. We joined a student organization because they gave away free pizza at all of their (frequent) events.
She graduated and immediately hit a $60k job, then a year later I graduated and got a $45k job. Huge jump of more than $80k/year over what we were making in college (I worked for the university at $10/hour for three months out of the year, and she was a tutor at the local high school for $10/hour for four months out of the year).
We saved almost everything. We bought a couch so we could sit down in our apartment, and we bought a TV so we would have something to look at from our couch. Other than that, everything went into savings. Three years later, we bought a house and are still saving money.
I didn't get any temptation to spend our savings, but I could see how it would be tempting to. We lived happily for years with a yearly income totaling under $10k between the two of us, so neither of us saw any benefit to just spending all of our savings on frivolous crap. |-|

I am not so sure if the tax harvesting would work as well as advertised but it is definitely an interesting thing to look into for your situation.

Another thing, you may want to wait a bit because Schwab is scheduled to come out with their version of betterment this quarter and they will charge no additional fees (google schwab intelligent portfolio).

|-| cnu84ui || -7 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| cnu86vw || 5 || A few thoughts:


1.  Stop contributing to your 401(k) once you've hit the employer match.  Instead, open a Roth IRA with Vanguard and max it out.  Only after you've maxed it out would I resume contributions to your 401(k).


Why prefer the IRA to the 401(k)?  Fees and greater choice of investment opportunities.  As a general rule, the expense ratios for that Vanguard charges for an IRA investor is smaller than the expense ratio that your 401(k) custodian will charge for the exact same fund.  And of course, you get to choose however you want to invest your IRA; by contrast, in your 401(k), you're limited to the small selection of (often overpriced) funds selected by your 401(k) custodian.


2.  I agree with others that you should continue to make your 401(k) contributions on a Roth rather than traditional basis.  You are very young.  In the future, you'll be in a higher tax bracket.  Wait until then before you start making traditional 401(k) contributions.  The fact that you make more than other people your age is totally irrelevant.  The only comparison that matters when choosing between Roth and traditional is your tax bracket NOW versus your tax bracket LATER.


3.  Cooking more of your own meals and drinking less when you're out with friends will really help cut your spending.  Many people can also save a ton of money by getting rid of Verizon or whichever other postpaid carrier they have and switching to an MVNO, like Cricket, Page Plus, Republic Wireless, or the like.


4.  You mention an upcoming move.  My guess is that you're a renter.  If you don't already have it, get renters' insurance ASAP.  It's very cheap.  You may get a deal if you bundle it with your auto insurance. |-| 
|-| cnu8a8c || -3 || I'm not sure I would trust the IRS to tell me how much I owe them or how much they owe me.

Edit: I'm fairly surprised this is a controversial post. I would have thought most people would have an innate distrust of the IRS after everything that has been happening. |-| 
|-| cnu8dlh || 6 || OP - I work in auto finance, and I think I should be able to give you some insight. However, there is no black and white answer.

First, understand the environment. The dealer and the lender want to make money on your loan. The optimum combination for you depends on what you are looking for. I would advise NOT to only look at interest rate. Interest rate is 1 piece of the puzzle. You can get an amazing rate, and get crushed somewhere else.

The dealer makes money off a few things: sale of the vehicle (price of the car), fees both with the customer and the lender, spread with the lender (additional rate to the customer that is paid upfront to the dealer) and off back end products (Warranty or GAP).

The lender makes money off of interest rate, and fees from the dealer. In rare cases the lender also makes money off the back end products, but this isn't a common practice and is becoming highly regulated.

The next item to understand is how rate is usually calculated by a lender. At my company we use credit, collateral, exposure and term as the key drivers. Credit is NOT the only item in the equation. It usually is the starting point though. Generally, older cars get higher interest rates than new cars. This is because the collateral is now aged, and is riskier. There is a chance the customer could walk from their loan due to repairs. The risk is the reason for increased rate. Next is the structure or exposure of the loan. If X is being lent, then the value of the car should be higher than X. There are loans where a customer is buying a 20,000 unit, but the loan is for 26,000. This is due to a negative trade, warranty, or some other item. This would be a cause for a higher rate. If you are putting 5 grand down, this should help this area. The last area is term. Usually a 60 month term has a lower interest rate than a 72 or even 72+ term loan. This is just like the financial markets. The longer the loan is exposed, the more rate that needs to be charged to cover it. Just like in mortgage how a 15 year loan is lower rate than a 30 year loan.

Now that you understand the environment you can get a loan two types of ways. There is an indirect method, and a direct method. A direct method is where you go to the bank and they give a rate and an amount you can finance. The indirect method, is where the dealer asks the banks for you. Both have their pluses.

The last thing you need to decide is what is important to you. Do you think you will have this loan for the full term? Do you want to pay the lowest price possible for the car? Do you want the lowest APR possible? Do you want the lowest monthly payment possible? Do you want a warranty to cover the car? There are more questions, but depending on your goals, you need to push the dealer in your direction. You can't have them all. The dealer needs to make money on something, as does the lender. The average consumer cares the most about their monthly payment. That means you would want a longer term and lower interest. However, over the total loan, you could pay more.

I would bet you are about a 720-740 score based on your comments, rate, and credit. The two items to do are shop around for a direct loan at banks, or talk with the dealer to come to an agreement where you both win. Understand what is important to you. You can be creative. You could literally pay $500 more for the car, just to get the rate down 2 points. The dealer would be making some money on you upfront, instead of the lender making on you on the back end.
Some food for thought. Hope it helps.

Only individuals who were married filing jointly were allowed the $53k cap limit. Every once in a while if the site isn't busy is when the site managers allows the volunteers to prepare something over the $25k limit like if the individual has dependents. 

It's a great program. That's why I am volunteering again this tax season. The VITA program does not do itemized deductions. Some sites have volunteers who tested at the advance level and they can handle more complicated returns. Some sites also have volunteers who are CPAs and they usually let more complicated returns slide. |-| 
|-| cnua49t || 8 || Unfortunately I cannot find the article however, Jalopnik wrote a great piece on the topic of yo-yo financing.

Read carefully over your sales contract. In many states if the dealer lets you drive off without approved finance that is their risk and you're entitled to return the car and walk away. 

I wouldn't give the dealer a cent - it's a known scam

|-| cnubmau || 4 || Debt-to-income is one of the most important sets of numbers banks will look at when deciding on a mortgage to offer you.  Judging by some of the other responses, though, I think you are defining debt-to-income incorrectly. 

There are generally 2 debt-to-income ratios considered: front end and back end. "Front end" is the ratio of your monthly house payment (mortgage principle and interest, property taxes, mortgage insurance, and any home owner association dues) to your gross monthly income. 

"Back end" is your housing payment plus all other credit payments you are required to make monthly - credit card minimum payments, student loan payments, etc. 

While different banks have differing restrictions, to get the best interest rate offer on your mortgage, you generally would need very good credit, 20% down payment, and Debt to Income ratios of &lt; 28/36 (28 front end, 36 back end).  Most banks won't consider you if your front end is &gt;32 or your back end greater than 44.

I'd suggest you consider how much of a house you want to buy, learn what your monthly payments would be based on a number of scenarios (how much of a down payment you'll make, your likely interest rate, whether or not you'll have to pay an HOA, etc), figure out your debt-to-income ratios based on your situation, and react accordingly.  You'll most likely want to put 20% down on your house if you can. 

Your student loan interest rate will have a lot to do with whether you want to pay it down early or not (keep in mind that that interest is most likely tax deductible, so your interest rate is a little lower than it shows on paper) |-|

&gt; I wanted to share a couple of things my parents did to teach me about finances. 

&gt; One year, in middle school, my parents decided I was going to learn more about budgeting and how much things really cost. They looked at their own finances for the year. Determined how much they were spending on me. And put it in a joint account in my name. They had me start paying for everything I did. Sport club fees, my phone bill, clothes shopping, etc. As I got older it included car insurance, gas, and other odds and ends. 

&gt; We would sit down at the beginning of every year and go over my budget. I was able to ask for more money at the start of every year but had to justify it. For example, when I turned 16 I proved to them I couldn’t afford gas and car insurance with my current budget. I calculated how much gas would cost to drive to school and sports practice every day and the average price for car insurance of new drivers.  Another time, they said no and I ended up with a part time job. Doing this every year made me very aware how much everything I wanted to do cost and taught me a lot about budgeting. 

&gt; Fast forward to paying for college. My parents and grandparents had set aside some money for me to go to college (I know not everyone is this lucky).  My parents said after the money they set aside for college was gone I was on my own. They also decided not to give it to me until after I graduated. They did this for a few reasons. 1) A college education is really important to them and this way I was motivated too 2) At this point in my life I had never really had to earn the money 3) Getting student loans and then paying them off right away would help my credit score. 

&gt; I paid my way through college by working, taking out some loans, and getting some scholarships. Because of the scholarship I was actually able to keep some of the money my parents had set aside for me. I am now a year out of college, have no debt, some money saved aside, and a firm grasp on my finances. I just wanted to share this and thank my parents for teaching me so much!

Similar to many others, I like to spend on travel and vacations. I think that if possible, incorporating travel expense into your budget is practically a necessity. If your mindset is to be frugal, save and put travel and interesting experiences off to some later point, just know that that time may never come. My grandfather worked hard and saved his whole career and lived a relatively modest life. The idea was to retire and then travel the world with my grandmother, taking all the trips they never had.

The FAFSA is just an application for aid ... *most* of what you're receiving is probably in loans that need to be paid back.

Those comments are completely un-helpful and hyperbolic; educators shouldn't be making them without clarification. Most loans default to a 10 year repayment plan. 10 years out of school is hardly "the rest of your life". Many of us plan to pay them off faster than that anyway. 

&gt;I don't have a good grasp on money and how much is a lot, but is paying off $100k hard?

That'll cost you *roughly* $1200/mo in repayments for 10 years. If you have a good job it's not that bad. If you've got a shit paying job (like some high school teachers unfortunately) you won't be able to make those on your salary. Then you'd have to switch to a longer term repayment plan of 20-25 years, which'll cost you more in interest over the long term but reduce your monthly payments. Farther than that you can go on an income based repayment plan where your payments are tied to your salary.

Let's assume you land a job when you graduate and can start paying off the loans aggressively on a 10-year plan. At 7% interest, you will pay about $1,100 a month and end up paying the original $100K + another $42K in interest before paying off the loan. 

You just paid $142K for an undergraduate degree and you will probably have to live pretty darn frugally over the next 5 years to do it, considering the average starting salary of an undergrad is about $45K a year. Here's the math:

* $45K starting salary 
* Take home after tax, social security, medicare: $35K
* Monthly take home: $2900
* Leftover after student loan debt payment: $1800

That's $1,800 you have to use for rent, utilities, possibly a car, insurance, food, cell phone service, etc... Not impossible, but not easy either. You will be living on a college student budget years after leaving college or even move back in with the folks if have to take a job that pays less. |-| 
|-| cnufrku || 3 || 100K is redicululous.  Why not a 30K state school?  Is this school name going to give you a $15K/year higher salary than a cheaper school?  If you're not pursing a law degree or an MBA, you won't really get 70K worth of value from the connections a prestigious school has to offer.

In answer to your question, paying off a REASONABLY PRICED school should take you 5-7 years, maybe even faster if you have no other debts or work while in school.  If it's taking you longer, you're living above your means, taking on too many additional debts, not using your degree to its full potential, or not setting aside enough to pay off your student loans.

NEVER PLAN TO PAY THE MINIMUM.  That's how you end up with a 10/15/20 year loan instead of a 3 year loan. |-|

* Your community college is not paid for by FAFSA. It's probably paid by grants - I know I went to community college for two years for free.
* Don't go to DePaul unless you can get in with good scholarships. Since it's a private school, there are *tons* of scholarship opportunities. My fiancee graduated from there with ~15k student loans.
* Make sure to god you get a good job out of it. If you don't hate the idea, DePaul is a strong feeder school for accounting.
* Your college professors could have made poor choices. While it's true most PhD programs are funded, most prestigious schools that fund don't tend to place students at community colleges. They place them at schools on the same level as themselves. It could be your professors were not funded due for one reason or another.
* Many community college professors do not have PhDs. No big deal education wise at that level, but non-PhD professors aren't making much money compared to their peers in industry.

Paying off $100k is going to be fucking shitty. It will literally ruin your life unless you get a windfall of $150k magically somehow from your Great Aunt Elsa when she kicks the bucket. Even if that happens, it'd be better to not have $100k in debt. Either go to a state school or do your best to get scholarships/financial assistance to attend DePaul. |-|

As an individual, you only qualify for VITA programs with income of $30k or less. Families and self employed qualify at $53k or less. That unclear title bothers me. Lots of individuals who saw that could be disappointed.

Edit: at least in MN that's the guideline we've been given. |-| 
|-| cnul0at || 4 || Tax Consultant here.

People use VITA should aware of the quality of preparer varies. The amount of refund depends on how well the preparer knows about the client (meaning, taking the time to ask the correct questions) and tax knowledge. 

The IRS has a test for volunteers to be a certify IRS preparer, there are 3 levels, basic, intermediate and advanced, and most non-profit organizations require the volunteer to pass inter-mediate level to prepare the tax returns. Then, usually there will be a person who passed the advanced test level to double check the return. You might think that this is great to have some one double check the work. Truth is, it doesn't necessarily mean that the tax return is right, because you need to know that these people might be a student or non tax professional who know so little about the tax codes. I have seen some people didn't know about moving expense, paid tuition, IRA contribution can be used as a tool to lower your AGI and get you more EIC, and the list can go on and on. On the other side, I also saw college acct/tax student, retire CPA, tax lawyer went the extra mile and did a great job to help the needed.  

Also, i just want to add that, no mistake return /=/ max refund, because there may be some deductions and/or credits that the client qualified for and the preparer wasn't aware of them.

In conclusion, i recommend using TurboTax and go with every damn annoying question, so it knows you better and get the right credits for you. OR go to AARP VITA free tax preparation service, most folks at AARP are long time tax enthusiast or tax/accounting professional.

I was with you right up to this.  There are better ways of building your credit that don't require paying interest.  For example, your parents could have put you on a credit card that they keep in good standing, and then have you get your own when you're 18.

If they had the money to pay for most or all of your schooling up front without loans, it's smarter to use that money up front to pay for school rather than taking loans and paying them off. |-|

Your buyer will pay you in cash (with a big check) but that money would come from a bank car loan.  Of course, most banks charge a higher interest rate for private party loans, but it's still feasible for a lot of people. Just an FYI.

Private market is your best option.  Dealerships will just give you less of a deal on a purchase if they give you a better trade-in value... In my experience, there is an inverse relationship between trade-in value and purchase price of another vehicle.  Dealerships always get there money on both ends of the transaction.  |-| 
|-| cnuwdl0 || 4 || I'm fine with doing my own taxes, but I do have some weird questions I've wanted to ask tax pros:

What's the logic for having people withhold 2 allowances if they are single and only have one job? From what I see (using [2015 Pub 15](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CC0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.irs.gov%2Fpub%2Firs-pdf%2Fp15.pdf&amp;ei=EVu-VLrBHbeMsQSsj4GwCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGdntQwWxYpijX2lNpu3y9EIhYUcQ&amp;sig2=9r5Bx3w02jPUjHezydFLsQ&amp;bvm=bv.83829542,d.cWc) (PDF warning)), this deducts 2x$4,000 from the employee's income, and the first $2,300 isn't taxed. So basically $10,300 is subtracted out and the rest is taxed. Which works, because an independent Single filer will deduct $6,300 + $4,000 = $10,300 with the std deduction and personal exemption anyway.

So the question is, why not just have the W4  have you take 1 exemption for yourself, and then just check a box saying you plan on taking the standard deduction? It would be easier to explain to people that you should have 1 allowance, not 2, because you are 1 person (or put 3 if you have 2 kids - right now you put 4!)

I guess it has to do with having multiple jobs. If you have two jobs then you just have 1 allowance kept from each ($4,000) because on the W4 you just check '1' for you and nothing else since you don't have one job. So $4,000 plus the $2,300 in those tax tables are subtracted. So $6,300 each job or $12,600 total. I guess this makes sense with our progressive taxation - you want to over-withhold a little with 2 jobs, because if one job was withhold perfectly (no tax liability) the second job would all be marginally taxed.

But still - it seems like you could simplify to the W4 with the "check 1 for you and check here if you will take the standard deduction" and then for you second job just mark "I have more than one job" which then kicks off additional withholding. |-|

As well, NONE of these people here have a real obligation to help you with any accuracy or understand your situation. **Without understanding the whole picture of your finances/taxes and spending time to follow up with you it is uncomfortably easy to provide inaccurate advice and any tax specialist would back me up on this.**

However, a lot of these people are more knowledgeable than most. Many can help you learn something new, and help explain things. They might be able to help you learn how to ask a specialist the right questions. They can help you understand a generalized, non-situation specific, idea of how something works.

Cons: Check deposits take a couple of days to clear (longer on the weekends), impossible to deposit cash.


I switched from a credit union that I have been with for years through my alma mater. The CU had terrible interest rates, an outdated web interface and app, and no local branches (I have since moved). So far, I am very happy with the switch.

Instead of doing a 1,000 mile plunge, can you look at areas further outside of your current city, but still close enough for a weekend visit? If you're an hour away by car, that gives plenty of opportunities to visit your folks, see your friends once in a while, while still being able to afford a home.

Even housing is 'correct', but that's more or less a function of what the average person pays, not what you want to pay. So for the bigger items like housing, since you're already scoping out places, just pick a few candidate places and use those actuals in your estimate. And a few other things aren't too hard to get actuals on, like call up your car insurance agent to get a quote for the new zip code.

Best of luck to you - seems like a big a choice!

And from a finance perspective, if cost of living is about equal, it can still be a boon for you if you're able to save the same percentage you do now (to savings or retirement), pretty much everywhere you retire will be a lower cost of living than Silicon Valley. |-|

|-| cnuy93e || 35 || Yes.  Well, we've done it both ways.  We moved from Arkansas to the DC area for my fiance's job, plus I'd recently graduated and the area was better for entry-level positions in my field.  After about three and a half years, we realized that we'd never be able to buy a home out there.  So we packed up and moved out to Tulsa, which has a very low cost of living.  

It's worked out great for us.  My fiance was able to get a job paying more than he made in the DC suburbs.  I'm making the same, though a lot of jobs out here I qualify for pay less.  But we save so much on rent alone that it would make up for the lowered salary if I needed to find a new job.  

As far as moving away from your friends and family, that's really a personal decision to weigh.  Moving away from my family wasn't a big deal for me, but my fiance is extremely close to his family, so it was much harder on him.  

Make sure you check out the job situation in the area you're moving to, obviously.  Since I'm the breadwinner, we picked Tulsa partly because it has a super low cost of living and partly because it has a growing tech sector, which is good for my career. |-| 
|-| cnuybwy || 3 || My BIL just did this. Lived in the DC area, then moved to a suburb outside of Austin. He had an advantage where he could work from home though, which is clearly a huge advantage.

I would say it's probably easier to meet news friends with a kid, because you meet other parents through daycare/school/sports, but overall making new friends is a major investment. If you have a close family, make sure you take increased travel  expenses into account.

Cheaper areas might also not have the same type of jobs, which eliminates any advantage (although there are certainly some cheap places that also have decent job markets like Texas for example). |-| 
|-| cnuyi08 || 24 || I went to school in Santa Clara...and let me tell you the cost of living is VERY HIGH. As much fun as CA was I am happy to have moved to Austin. DONT LEAVE TEXAS, especially for CA.

|-| cnuykcy || 50 || Lucky for you Tundras, and Tacomas specifically, hold their re-sell value really really well. I did the exact same thing as you early last year. I owned a 2013 Tacoma for about a year, realized I didn't need it.Put 4,800 miles on it, and sold it a year later for only $1,000 less than what I bought it for new. Posted an ad on Craigslist, and waited for a serious buyer. Met him at his local credit union where he took out the loan to purchase the truck. Two checks were cut, one to my lender for what I owed, and one to me for the equity I had in it. Way better than bringing it to a Carmax or something similar. Patience is really the key.. |-| 
|-| cnuymbh || 13 || I moved from Los Angeles to Portland, OR for quality of life and cost of living issues. Kept my LA job and work from home with some travel.


The problem is now that there are not many comparable jobs in the area, and certainly not at this salary level. If I make a change, I'll have to take a cut in pay. I'm trying to counteract this by getting additional professional certification, and reducing my expenses and increasing my savings as much as possible.

*edit: buying a nice house in '09 for under $200k was pretty awesome. |-| 
|-| cnuyn58 || 4 || I think an important factor is if you're moving a family with you. That multiplies your expenses by a factor.

As for the housing, if you're renting, I feel like you should still be able to account for the differences with the 60K increase in salary. However, do realize that if you want to buy a house in near or intermediate future, SV will be much harder to save for the downpayment.

Don't forget state and local taxes. |-|

|-| cnuyo8e || 4 || Don't know what the cost difference is, since I'm not familiar with Dallas, but despite being one of the less expensive nice neighborhoods, Santa Clara is still very expensive. Expect at least 2000 a month in living expenses if you want to live on your own.

People don't seem to realize how much there is to do in smaller cities.  I actually am way more engaged in St. Louis than I ever was in So Cal because it's cheaper and easier to do things.  I go to shows, museums, sporting events, and eat at great restaurants and don't feel like I'm spending my whole pay check when I do.   |-|

|-| cnuytnu || 5 || If you move to CA you're going to be in the 9.3% state income tax bracket for most of your income. That's not a trivial amount.   |-| 
|-| cnuyvzh || 4 || I think it's very important to look at cost of living calculators and all that. We know housing will go up. But also consider the fact that your income of 130k is likely to increase over time. The first year may take some adjustment, but obviously you're doing something right at work and if that continues you'll probably making 150k-170k in a couple years. And you can always move outside the city and live in a slightly smaller place for a year or two while you wait for your income to go up even further. I say take the promotion. |-| 
|-| cnuyzla || 21 || I don't have personal experience with those two cities, but the calculators make it seem that the salary difference "makes up" for the COL change. I find that high salary + HCOL areas can allow you to save more relative to LCOL if you're willing to give up some lifestyle, or generally try and live frugally.

But, honestly I wouldn't look at this situation in this way. I would ask bigger questions - would I like CA life? Could I stay there for a while? What do I give up by leaving? Is this a better choice for my career long term? In which job do I stand to move up quicker?

Also look at other life goals. Do you plan to own a home (CA may not be the best option)? Can you raise kids downtown? |-| 
|-| cnuz2hi || 105 || Here's my take on it...

At 71k and no state tax your net pay could be 42K
At 131k and ca state tax your net pay could be  69K

Difference = 27K
Current rent in Dallas 1k
Rent in Bay Area varies from 2k to 3k

12 month rent difference could be anywhere between 12k to 24K

You are in the black as long as you find a place to live that keeps the difference positive. This removes the cost of housing. Food and the rest are comparable. Gas may not be but u have better commuting options than Dallas. 


That's the dumb version of the math there are other aspects that would apply. Your age and family if any, dual income or single income, perks at both the current employer and your future employer. Consider all these. And lastly with your Bay Area experience you can always go back to Dallas a bit more experienced! 

EDIT: 27K difference not 17K ..apologies..was posting in a rush |-| 
|-| cnuz7od || 34 || if you want to be a star move to Hollywood, if you want to make it in tech move to silicon valley. 
if your income goes up 7-10% a year i would want to start at 130k.  |-| 
|-| cnuz8iw || 3 || I moved from So Cal to Austin, TX and couldn't be happier. While still 'expensive' here, it is nothing compared to CA and one of the nice things is no state income tax. I say do it - find a job and hit the road...just don't move to Austin, move to Dallas ;) |-| 
|-| cnuz9fs || 354 || Something that I haven't seen mentioned is that if you have a greater potential for advancement in the new office, a **temporary, small** adjustment in quality of life might be worth it. |-| 
|-| cnuz9ip || 5 || I lived in OC for a few years making 60k - 80k varying by commissions and I did all right (looks like Silicon Valley is a bit more expensive than OC though). I lived in a gated, wooded community in a nice area &amp; had two cars... still maxed out my 401K during a few of the years closer to 80k.  
Besides the ridiculousness of housing &amp; the cost of rent, other expenses were pretty bearable at that income. The only other item on my budget that dropped quite a bit after leaving was car insurance.  
Anyway, I think $130k a year would be plenty to live very comfortably on. I just left after 5 years because I was in a dead end job. Now I'm back in a small, rural town making $20k a year less but paying as much on my mortgage/taxes/insurance as I was on rent. Tried it, enjoyed it, moved on... while making a lot less than you! |-|

Close to DC, close to mountains, close to the beach. 

Traffics not bad and everything is reasonably priced. Almost any of the surrounding metro area's are great. Short Pump, VA for high end homes and high end shopping. Midlothian, mechanicsville, chesterfield for more reasonable. 

There are even some places closer to the city that are awesome and reasonably priced if your into that. We also have a river going through the city and everyone is really active.

Also, not really far from NYC. Can take the train :)

|-| cnuzqvz || 74 || I'm in the Bay Area and moved here from Houston.
That's one of the most expensive areas in the country.

Other people can probably help you do a better determination of whether or not it's an actual raise for you. My suggestion for you to consider, is the future impact of taking this raise.  For example if you earn cost-of-living 4% increase is going to be a lot more with the new job then with the current job. And in that stuff will build on itself and grow exponentially. Also to consider his future promotions. 
Honestly, that much money isn't a lot in the bay area. But it might be a steppingstone to a future fortune. |-| 
|-| cnuzt62 || 9 || A few years back I moved from Rochester NY to Sunnyvale CA (which is in Santa Clara county). My salary in NY was ~43k/year, and my salary in CA was ~70k/year. It was a big jump in salary! But after increased rent, taxes, and other living expenses, it was pretty much a wash. I took home about the same amount of money at the end of the day. I subsequently moved to NYC for a much better salary.

Theres something to be said about advancing your career. You could always take that new title and higher salary in CA, and then move back to Texas for an an even higher salary in 2 years or so.  |-|

|-| cnuzxxg || 3 || It's probably not worth it.  I live here.  Search Zillow for condos under $500,000, you'll hear crickets.  There are no houses for that amount. It could be cheaper if you live in the East Bay but your commute will be about an hour and half as you'll have to cross a bridge.  Apartments start at about $2200 for a one bedroom.  Anything less and the area would be questionable. Gas is $2.60 which is cheap compared to a few years ago but I don't know what you are paying currently.  A gallon of milk is about $5.00.   If you move here you may open up promotion opportunities but it will be a little tight until you make more money or marry someone so you have a double income.

If you have any specific questions feel free to PM me. |-| 
|-| cnv01fg || 7 || This is a little more complex because it is a duplex.  The portion of the sale that belongs to the area of the house you lived in would be tax free assuming you met the criteria outlined in your link.  
  
The portion of the house you rented would not be tax free on sale.  You should also be including depreciation in your calculation of what taxes will be owed.

|-| cnv0dtb || 7 || I understand you want to do a numbers comparison here, and that's tricky (though I'm pretty sure you'll be just fine out there at 130k). Here's another perspective:

Regardless of your perception on things, there's a big difference in people making less than 100k and people making more. Think of the future of your career--when recruiters are talking to you or you're looking to change roles, your salary is a number they use to determine how much value you provide to a company. Sure, everybody knows wages are generally a bit higher in areas with higher COL. But that doesn't matter as much as the fact as you could be worth 71.5k to a company, or you could be worth 130k to a company. Be worth 130k. |-| 
|-| cnv0eey || 3 || I currently live in Santa Clara.  I work at Cisco as an engineer and make 103,000.  I have a family of 3 and my my wife stays home and takes care of my son who is one year old.  I am 26 and my wife is 22. 

I live a couple miles down the street from the 49'ers stadium.  I have a spacious (for california) 2 bedroom and 2 bath apartment.  This is the best apartment complex i have found.  Even though we are really in an industrial area, having 2000 apartments here makes it feel like a residential and we have a 5 acre park and 10 pools.  I pay 2095 right now, because we are in the median housing program (under 106k family of 3 qualify).  Our rent will be increasing 300-400 dollars in a couple months when our lease is up.  There are not many other places in san jose that are cheaper.  The only places that are affordable to buy will be in gilroy or in morgan hill which means you have a 1 hour commute up to 2 hours in the worst time of day.  These are both to the south.  You could look into areas like san mateo which are north but still gonna be same commute. 

I would stay away from areas in east side san jose.  The rent and places are cheaper but for a good reason.  The gangs, Nortenos and Sorenos (don't know how to do the accents)  live in those areas.  Its safe to drive and be there during the day in most areas but I wouldn't be there at night.  (Source I have been stabbed by someone in sorenos and I have had friends who were in both gangs.)

But really thats the only area in san jose area that would be "dangerous".  San Jose is really a wonderful place to live.  The weather is always great.  Very little rain, very little obscenely hot days, and very little cold weather.  Santa Clara is 1 hour away from the beach in santa cruz when theres no traffic.  Lake Tahoe is 5 hours away for wonderful skiing and snowboarding.  San Francisco is 45 minutes away.  SFO is 30 minutes away from Santa Clara with no traffic (I fly for my job multiple times a month).  

For a family of 3 I pay about 450 for groceries a month ( We try to buy organic and cage free eggs, and we try to stay away from hormone meat).

Really the only hard part is housing.  If you have a downpayment saved up and can buy a townhome somewhere close, maybe fremont(15 minutes no traffic, 30 minute with traffic), or even gilroy (40 minutes no traffic, 1 hour 30 minute -2 hour with traffic) then you will probably love it here.   |-|

And a smart buyer is the one who will arrange their own financing at their own bank or Credit Union. 

You don't worry about the financing. The smart buyer already knows they will get the best price on a vehicle on a private sale, and that they will get get the best financing  by doing it themselves. 

You want a smart buyer.

It may take longer to for a smart buyer to find you.  Its well worth it. 

Keep the truck in ready to show condition. 

Research the private party sale price for you area/region on kbb.com and http://clearbook.truecar.com/ 

Set the price a little high so you can come down when they ask you to, and they feel like they bargained you down.  

Remember - you want private party sale price, not trade in or wholesale price. 

If you're willing to go for trade in or wholesale, then just trade it in to the dealer.

You need to contact the lienholder/loan holder to find out what your pay out is on the loan. 

If it is higher than the price of the car, arranging the transfer of the title will be trickier.   Get the details on how to do that and have it set up in advance. 

This applies when you the lienholder has the title anyway, so no matter what you have to do it.  |-| 
|-| cnv0ipt || 4 || Even if you get less for your money in the short term I would still consider the move. It's not as simple as immediate differences in the cost of living. Be sure to factor in potential unseen benefits. By this I mean you will be wotking at a higher level, which will open up positions to you based on your new experience that you currently aren't qualified for. And those positions could make more. Or you could relocate after a few years to a cheaper area, but looking for higher level positions since that's your new experience level. |-| 
|-| cnv0lxz || 4 || I hope the $130k number is just base pay and that you get additional incentives, such as bonuses and stock options.  Though, having lived in Santa Clara, $130k will feel pretty affordable (even after maxing out on 401k) if you don't plan on owning a home and don't have kids. Renting in a good/reasonable school district is going to cost a lot more. The other thing to consider is that if you are a single male and you are not in a relationship and you desire to be in one, there will be a lot more competition finding a companion. |-|

The same rent we were paying for a one-bedroom, 4th story walk-up apartment an hour (via PATH and subway) from our offices in Manhattan now gets us a two-bedroom penthouse apartment in a doorman building in the nicest part of the city, which is a short walk from both of our jobs.

One of my college roommates just did the same thing with a move from Miami to Des Moines and he feels the same way about the economics.

We're moving from Los Angeles to areas unknown, and taking some time to backpack around North America first.  It's a mid-career (ages 32 for both my wife and I) gap year and I couldn't be happier.  We'll probably settle down in the mountains near family (Idaho/Montana/etc).  I don't know how things will turn out, exactly, but having now taken the plunge I am SO HAPPY!  We agonized and agonized over the decision, but now that its done I can't believe we lasted as long as we did in Los Angeles (10 years).  Life is too short for this much traffic, frustration, and expense.   |-|

A quick search on Craigslist shows you can buy a 27 foot hybrid travel trailer with a slider (important) for $6,500. You can spend more or less depending on how high a lifestyle you want to enjoy. 

You can then buy my 2003 Dodge Ram 2500 for ten grand -- consider it a going away present cuz' that's a steal. That'll tow it to Santa Clara. 

Now it's a huge raise. So go enjoy the experience. And if it sucks, you can just haul everything back. 

You're welcome.  |-| 
|-| cnv0trl || 41 || I just made the move in the passed year. Look at online calculators, but take it with a grain of salt. Scope out the housing market. You'll most likely have to rent. Then take that, huge, bump into the equation. Then imagine that the rest of your expenses are increased by 10-15%. However, you probably won't have AC and if you can live at 66-70 degrees through the 'winter', then you probably won't have a huge electric/gas bill. (I see that you are coming from TX, so maybe 66 is too low for you?)

For me, I went from a 5br/2.5ba house in the mid-west to a 3br/2ba in Santa Clara. My current rent is 2.5x what my mortgage was in the mid-west. But, my salary bump made up for it.

Some other factors, each of which could easily break the deal:

* Figure out what your commute will be like. There are several bus lines (most likely VTA in Santa Clara/San Jose), Light Rail, Cal Train, Car, Ride share, Uber, and etc.

* Are you expecting longer hours?

* Are the expectations attainable?

* How many people do you know in the area?

* Outside of work, how many people do you know in the area?

* ... the list goes on.

I actually scored fairly low on my own metrics, but (here's the kicker) there's so many job opportunities out here. In the passed 6mo, I have had more recruiters contact me than I had in the passed 5 years. Also, I came out ahead, and, overall, the area is really nice place to live (despite the relative isolation from family and close-friends).

A few demands that you should ask for,

* Full moving expenses. 
  * If you have an entire household to move, then you need 10k-20k. 
  * Plus, Gas, Hotels, Airline tickets, meals, etc.
* Corporate Housing for a month.
  * Or, alternatively, a week visit to find a place.
* One-time cash bonus.
  * If you can manage it. If you were to find a new job in the Bay Area, any company would give you $10k bonus in a heartbeat. |-| 
|-| cnv0wnh || 6 || GO TO SILICON VALLEY! Your job is going to more than make up for the cost of living adjustment, especially with that salary. As long as it's a good opportunity with a good company, you will have access to more raises and promotions. Think of the opportunity you will have in the new place over how much the cost of living adjustment is. And at $130k I imagine you'll still be living pretty well |-| 
|-| cnv0xcm || 7 || Yes. Bay Area to Colorado.  Best choice we ever made.  The cost of living helps a lot, but the speed of life and basic priority - shifts have been pleasant surprises.  It is nice to raise children when you actually have time to spend with them. we actually do well enough to live on one income, something we never could have done nor would have enjoyed back in California. 

Eventually my parents moved out here when they retired, that's how we dealt with the family stuff.

Here's the most important perspective- it is a one-way ticket.  If you decide to make the move, decide now that you will like it.  You won't resent anything you perceive to lose, enjoy everything you think you have gained.  Happiness really can be a choice, contentment is something you can find on any pay scale.  If you make that conscious choice before you go, with reasonable expectations that you won't necessarily love everything but can still be content- it will go much easier on you. |-|

|-| cnv118z || 94 || From someone who's made a similar jump: It's worth it.  Working a top-tier tech company is so much incredibly better than working at a not-top-tier tech company.

|-| cnv13rq || 4 || &gt; When I go to file my taxes do I have to put that someone else can claim me as a dependent since that is how I did my paperwork for my job back in august? 

No. The paperwork you filled out before was just to help estimate the taxes that should be withheld.  Your selections on those forms does not affect how you need to file your tax return.

Yes.   |-|

&gt;All our friends and family are here

You'll make new friends and you'll maintain contact with the ones you deem important enough to do so.  You'll probably see your family in person less if you live in the same city as them and regularly interact with them, but after a few hundred miles it won't have an increasing impact on your time together, 400 miles is effectively effectively just as far away as 1000.  This is normal, though, and people have been doing it throughout human history, except now we have social media and VoIP.

&gt;Our jobs are here

Not knowing your personal views on the values of work, or the types of work you do, I'd suggest that your profession is likely to earn a higher net somewhere in the country, and that so long as you stay in the same field your working life probably won't change drastically in a new place.

&gt;We may have a kid in the next year or two, and it would be much easier to raise a kid near our parents/siblings

What is worth more to you, low cost of living or the potential convenience of child rearing nearby family? That's too personal of a decision for me to even poke with a stick.

|-| cnv16ix || 5 || First, use an online paycheck calculator! This will show you the magnitude of CA state income taxes. Let's do the math using ADP's calculator (http://www.adp.com/tools-and-resources/calculators-and-tools/payroll-calculators/salary-paycheck-calculator.aspx). I'm filing as single, 2 federal allowances for this example. I'm excluding things like 401(k) deductions for simplicity as well.

Net monthly pay in Dallas on $71,500/year? -- $4,578.03.

Net monthly pay in CA on $130k/year? -- $6,865.41.

Net difference per month? -- $2,287.38.

Net difference per year? -- ~$27,000.

That's a fairly large difference and should allow you to weather the COL differences provided you're fine with renting. That said, you won't be able to afford a decent house for sure and probably won't be able to just plant roots there and retire one day unless you end up making significantly more money or get married to someone with a similar income.

TL;DR: From a purely financial viewpoint, assuming you just rent an apartment, you can probably replicate your current lifestyle and save a bit more at the same time. But you definitely won't be buying a home (need $200k+ for that). From a career viewpoint, it might be an invaluable move (only you can predict that part). |-| 
|-| cnv18wr || 10 || I live in the Bay Area. 100k is essentially middle class minimum here. You can live on that, but you won't save much, and don't plan on ever buying property. A tear down home in Silicon Valley will run you a million dollars. 

There's also not a ton to do in Santa Clara or the surrounding area:  that's why so many companies bus their employees to San Francisco, where there is more going on. If you are single, meeting people can be tough. 

While doubling your salary sounds awesome, you may see your quality of life staying on-par without seeing greater savings in the long run.  |-|

Based on your description of your finances, this would be ruinous for you.  (And your sister.)

Therefore, you must not do it.  Sorry.  Put it out of your mind.  Don't consider it for a second.

&gt; He stopped paying the mortgage one year 

So, where did that money go?  His income (whatever it might be) that used to be paying the mortgage has gone... where?

If you ever take a course about life saving, they'll teach you not to let drowning people pull you under.  This also holds true for finance.

Sell the house immediately if more money can be obtained for it, get a moving truck and help your parents move into a small rented apartment which THEY will pay the rent on.  You and your sister have a combined income of $25K USD.  Don't even think about buying a house for your parents - any house.

|-| cnv1jkq || 4 || What you filed on your W-4 does not control what you file on your taxes.

The one thing you should confirm is who (if anyone) paid for at least 51% of your living expenses for all of 2014. If your parents 100% supported you until August and then you 100% supported yourself from August until the new year, then your parents are still able to claim you, as they provided more than 51% of your total support. If the case was your parents only provided 51% of your support until August and then 0% from them on, then they are not eligible to claim you.

The main point there is that just because you started fully supporting yourself in August does not mean you are able to claim yourself if you were not contributing significantly to your support before August. |-| 
|-| cnv1kl4 || 7 || I've lived in SoCal most of my life (close to downtown/ktown/USC/hollywood area/) and never once was I star stricken until I moved to Silicon Valley (SV). I remember the first few months getting so excited whenever I saw a tech logo/business/company I recognized. I was living comfortably and supporting my family in LA on a base salary of $72K. I was able to have fun and I had $75K in my company's 401k. Then I got an offer to move to SV in 2011 with a salary bump to $105K. I somehow tripped and fell into Sunnyvale and worked out of downtown Mountain View. Life is GREAT up here. I biked to work, I worked off of bean bag, I grew out my beard, I got my first MacBook Pro, I was surrounded by liked mined folks...I was in nerd heaven...but at the same time I REALLY missed what LA had to offer and of course my family/friends. 

Fast forward to now, I've purchased a 715 sqft "condo" for $355k in Santa Clara, my base salary has gone up to 120k (closer to $150k with perks and benefits). My cost of living is a reasonable ~$2100 a month (mortgage, property tax and HOA) thanks to being able to borrow from my 401k to put towards my downpayment.

I got lucky...the startup I moved up here for got acquired by a HUGE networking company and I got a bunch of stock options and extra cash from the sale.

If you're in tech and love what you're doing, SV is the place to be at and you'll be very comfy with $130k. See if they're willing to pay for your relocation cost. And who knows, maybe after a few years, you'll network around and find better opportunities here.  NOW...with that said; are you moving by yourself or with a family? Unless you're making a ton of money and can afford to purchase a home in Sunnyvale, than SV is not really family orientated. To me, it's more geared for single people. Oh and it's difficult to make new friends in your 30s here....

**tl;dr** great career opportunity, you'll make a lot of money, SV not really family orientated, but great for singles |-|

My father in law is a real cost of living geek, and he is always going over the DFW vs. Silicon Valley (former programmer/developer, moved up to executive, is in the process of retiring.) His daughter, (my wife) is an Intellectual Property attorney, so she's always thinking about the move as well. It's actually something I listen to them talk about alot. I work from home, so it doesn't matter to me. 

He's lived in Xi'an, Beijing, Hong Kong, Silicon Valley, various places in Canada, and DFW, and he is always looking at COLA for this reason, and he does it now for his daughter (he is a COLA and deals freak, always studying prices, looking for a deal, etc., you know the kind of guy.)  He estimated a 2.3:1 COLA difference between DFW (general) and Silicon Valley general, about a year ago. He pegs Frisco/Collin County where we want to live, to Silicon valley at about 1.9:1. 

I tend not to ask too much about how he does it, I just know that everything he does turns to gold, and he has never steered me wrong in buying housing, etc. The house he get us into a couple of years ago, for example, has appreciated like 60%. 

Collin County houses are ridiculous right now though, if that's where you live in DFW. That ratio might be getting closer and closer, depending on commute distances changing up the housing costs and property taxation. 
 
You're going to be splitting hairs, and I would say you should go where you want to live based on two things. 

1. Where do you like to live? California weather rules. The Bay Area is beautiful. However, I don't like to live close to people, I like big properties, and I like having my property classified as farm land for tax purposes, and also I really like having animals around and enough property to subsistence farm to a large extent. I also really like to play tennis, we like dog agility, we like badminton, and we like to shoot guns. We like to shoot guns on our property, and we like to be left alone, in general. All of those activities are within about a ten minute drive from where I live, and this is one of the most active areas in the nation for the level of recreational tennis that I play at. There are also multiple relatively cheap tennis clubs and city tennis centers where I live, as well as one of America's few badminton only centers, and a dog agility facility that's one of the tops in the nation. Add to that Elm Forks shotgun courses in Dallas/Irving, about 20 miles away being the largest (and in my opinion best) facility in the nation at over 500 acres of shutgunning courses, gun laws in Texas, and the fact that a ton of our family lives in Texas (although I have some aunts and uncles in Silicon Valley) and for us, lifestyle in DFW wins out easy. 

2. Where will your career advance faster? For me, this is also a close call. There are more people doing what I do in California, so more competition, I also have good ins with people that refer me business in Texas already, but then again, maybe I keep those connections and develop new ones in Cali and I'm better off. For my wife, she'd have to take the California bar exam, no biggie, but she's already on partner track where she is at. She went to school down here as well, and has connections here, lots of large firms are moving to DFW and will likely need in house counsel, which is what she will probably eventually want to do. Then again, the jobs are paying about double in California, and maybe she makes partner and really cashes in if we move there. It's about break even for us again on this issue. Probably we lean a little Cali on this end. 

So, for us, financially, it's pretty much a wash, as far as we can tell (although, again my FIL believes that there's more growth potential in terms of appreciation of your housing here in DFW, so maybe financially better off sitting on our property here) but in terms of lifestyle, and that's a big one to us, the checkmarks are all on the DFW side of the ledger. 

Anyway, it's a tough decision, because it seems like you're right around break even financially. Best of luck on the decision.  |-| 
|-| cnv1wuw || 3 || The cost of housing alone would eat up most of the increase in income.  Couple that with a higher federal income tax bracket, having to pay into state income tax, and the higher cost of staple goods like food and utilities, and you are probably losing money.  I make substantially more than what you are being offered and I would not move there. |-| 
|-| cnv1xtx || 4 || I moved from the bay area to a (relatively) small town south of Salt Lake City. Cost of living delta was much more dramatic than online calculators suggested-- we are shocked by how much more money we have. Of course, in our case, we maintained the same salary (I have the same job as before, just working remotely) so the calculous was a little different for us. 

I've always said that you should spend your life in an area where cost-of-living is the highest possible (assuming salaries are commensurate) and then retire where the cost-of-living is lowest. Retirement savings will, by definition, always be a percentage of your income, so earning a higher income at a higher cost-of-living may seem like a wash, but it's not in the long run.

While there are negatives, we're very happy with the move we made. The house we bought in Utah for &lt;$350K would be a $2-3m home in the bay area, and we are now able to save 50-70% of every dollar we make.   |-|

|-| cnv1ye5 || 3 || You should absolutely file your taxes. You should be eligible for the [American Opportunity Tax Credit](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/AOTC). 

As far as your Ebay income, were you buying and selling, or just selling old stuff you have? For this year, it probably won't matter, but if you're buying and selling, you generally only will pay taxes on your profit. If you're selling your old stuff, you'll likely have no basis in the item, meaning that anything you can get for it is profit.

You will need to fill out a Schedule C, and pay self employment tax on this income, but the AOTC *should* wipe all of that out, and give you an extra $1,000 to boot. 

You can use the IRS Free-File website, and many colleges have a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program, where you can get free help on your taxes. I'm not sure if they do Schedule C though, so its worth a call or an email before you waste your time there. |-| 
|-| cnv1yqc || 5 || We lived in MA, NJ an PA and moved to charlotte about 9 years ago. It's been great. Low taxes, better weather, cheap real estate, friendly people. Got tired of that near 40 mile commute so we could afford an ok house for our young daughter at the time. 

I took a 9% pay cut at first but the difference in CoL more thankmade up for it. You couldn't pay me to move to SF or NYC to live like that after being down here for a while. 
 |-| 
|-| cnv1zg1 || 3 || If you're in NYC, have you considered moving to the Philly area? It's much cheaper (although, granted not as cheap as where you seem to be looking), jobs in many industries are readily available, and the trip to New York is pretty easy. |-| 
|-| cnv24bt || 6 || Well, what I'd suggest you do is once you've figured out if you want to leave or not, tell your boss. Even if you don't necessarily want to leave, tell your boss about the offer. Many, if not most, companies will try to get you to stay. Honestly, the difference between 70k and 130k is quite large, even when accounting for cost of living. I think you can definitely squeeze 10 - 20% more out of your current position.  |-| 
|-| cnv24fu || 4 || I always get hung up on this bit. I make about $80k in SW PA right now. I'd *LOVE* to move out west. everyone always goes on about how you'll live in the slums unless you're making well over 100k.. I find it hard to wrap my head around a bunch of people making &gt; 100k/year living in shitty neighborhoods.  |-| 
|-| cnv266g || 4 || I think everyone should make a "big" move at least 3-4 times in their life. It gets them into new cultures, and opens up their minds about things. If you like the New York burbs you would love South East Florida (Fort lauderdale/Miami) Great cost of living and so much to do - and the weather? Perfect. |-| 
|-| cnv2bq7 || 7 || As someone who moved to Silicon Valley several years ago, I can give you tons of advice but would like to know your situation a little better. I mentor and provide guidance to college grads all the time. PM me if you want advice. 

Don't focus on the salary, instead consider the entire package. Salary just means getting by month-to-month, but where you're really going to benefit is in the rest of the package. If you have a wife and kids, 130K is not going to cut it. If you're going to work for a big tech company (Google, Yahoo!, eBay), they all offer lots of perks, including mostly paid benefits, free meals, stock (options/rsus), and giant bonuses. 

Consider moving to the Bay Area to work for a tech company as  paying an _opportunity_ tax. Even if at the end of the day you're not making that much more, your exposure and career trajectory will be greatly accelerated. 

My interns-turned-fulltime make between 110-125/yr, so you might be getting a stiffed depending on what you're doing and your previous experience. |-| 
|-| cnv2bzf || 558 || I was offered a job in the Valley last April and moved from DC to San Francisco. Very similar situation, although my salary base in DC before I moved was a bit higher than yours in Dallas. Some quick observations from the last year.

1. Housing costs are going to punch you straight in the grundle.

2. I mean like right in the taint. Repeatedly. All day.

3. That said, I chose to pay the premium and live in the heart of SFO. It's cheaper (not by much) to live in the Santa Clara area, but the quality of life in the city is just so much better IMO. There is absolutely nothing to do in the Valley other than work, so keep that in mind when you're evaluating the reasons you'd want to move.

4. California as a whole is expensive. State taxes are almost double what I was paying back East, and the price of pretty much everything here from gas to groceries is going to be inflated. Other than alcohol. Lots of cheap booze.

5. Consider your transportation needs as part of the equation, especially if you're looking to live outside the Valley. Gas prices are dropping sure, but 80 miles a day will be a tough pill to swallow. If your company offers a shuttle or stipend, factor that in.

6. Your income is nearly doubling. Your quality of life will not take as big a hit as you think it will. Unless you plan to buy a house in the next few years (See #1 and 2), you're probably way overthinking it like I did. I spent 2 and a half weeks mulling the offer over and weighing pros and cons. I can't tell you how many spreadsheets and comparative charts I put together to try to attach a magic number to it. In retrospect, none of that mattered at all.

7. The Bay Area is incredibly incestual. Since moving, I've been contacted by at least 2 major companies for jobs that presumably make a considerable amount more. Let's say you get here and your job (whatever you do) isn't what you thought it'd be. You can start looking at alternative options here immediately. It's competitive to get here, but once you're here it seems that opportunities to advance are readily available.

8. Why do you want to pursue this? Because of the money or the potential to develop yourself? Think about it, and you'll have your answer. |-| 
|-| cnv2fmr || 13 || The best way to make 6 figures in the future is to have made it in the past. The fact that you're considering this suggests some degree of professional ambition. Even if this ended up even money for you, don't pass up opportunities to demonstrate high pay and high responsibility on a resume.  |-| 
|-| cnv2kui || 5 || We lived in NYC (Manhattan, ouch), and then Washington DC (also ouch). My SO then got offered a job in Amsterdam, NY, making roughly the same salary. However, after a year of being here, I still cannot get over how cheap everything is. Birthday dinner at a nice restaurant for two with drinks &amp; appetizers for $50?!? Five bedroom beautiful house for $150k??

However, the cons after living in a big city can be a real bummer (not living that close to a big airport, not many "going out" choices, difficult to meet people, zero public transport). However, we decided that we would try it out for a couple of years and rent, and at the very least save up a bootyload of money before moving back to a big city. One year in so far with no plans to move yet. |-| 
|-| cnv2pf4 || 7 || You should file your taxes and report your income.

That aside, the answers to your questions are:

1. It is significant to you if you file your taxes as independent, because if you're paying for education and it isn't all covered by tax-free educational assistance (e.g. scholarships, Pell grant, etc. reduce the amount you can get back), then you can reduce the amount of taxes you owe by $2500, up to a limit of -$1000 (so you can receive a refund of up to $1000 from this credit). If you don't file your taxes, allow your parents to claim you as a dependent, or have had your education covered by scholarships etc. it's not significant to you.

2. You can only use this form in a way that benefits you if you can file independent for the tax year. That means you need to prove that you supported yourself for over 51% of your living expenses (not educational expenses, e.g. for room/board/rent, food, transportation, bills, etc.). If you can file independent because your parents weren't covering over half of your living expenses, then yes, you should use this form because they cannot claim you as a dependent. If you cannot because you were living with your parents or if they gave you money for your living expenses that amounted to over 51%, then no, you cannot claim this credit anyway. The question of who should use the form is not decided by who benefits from it, but simply by dependency status. So if you were supporting yourself in living expenses, then go ahead. If you weren't and your parents can claim you as a dependent and get tax benefits to help with the cost of supporting you, the AOTC is one of them so you can't use the form.

3. I don't know exactly, but it's my understanding that you'll always get the amount you need to meet Cost of Attendance and if you have scholarships they'll remain the same; the only difference is if you have some income, you'll get less Pell grant and more loans. If you really want to figure it out, you can do the calculations: http://ifap.ed.gov/efcformulaguide/attachments/090214EFCFormulaGuide1516.pdf Note that for FAFSA purposes, you are almost definitely a dependent student (FAFSA dependency is entirely separate from IRS dependency). |-| 
|-| cnv2sao || 5 || The catch: I am 42, currently unemployed, going through a divorce, and with a 3yo son.

You're not on the hook for your parents...and their mistakes. I know that you feel some guilty  responsibility, but you REALLY need to distance yourself, and your own problems from this debacle created by your parents.  |-| 
|-| cnv2xg0 || 3 || I completely agree with the idea of moving away from NYC. To add some perspective of my stance, I hate cities, NYC and North Jersey. I grew up in the rural midwest and could walk out my backdoor into the woods. No driving to a park for a hike, I would just walk outside. I miss that. That aside, I now live in North Jersey because my wife works in NYC. We are in a similar boat to you. We have 200k+ liquid assets for a house, have been looking around but find everything around stupendously expensive. I never wanted to live in NYC anyway so often comment about moving to my wife. I telework and make 100k+ so can work anywhere in the U.S. We made a deal given the extreme costs of NYC that unless she ended up making 200k+ we would move once she had enough experience to do so. Sadly (in the sense we probably should stay in NYC) she now makes 200k+ so we have been looking at house hunting. We have mainly been looking at housing outside of NYC, we never even looked in Manhattan or its boroughs. The fastest commutes are from North Jersey though a few in Long Island and Westchester can be sub 1 hour commutes depending on your work location. 

I would suggest if you can get out that you do so. I would if I could. However I would make the decision based upon employment options. If you can get a job elsewhere, for at least one of you, then it might be worth moving. Just make sure you move to an area that still has enough job opportunities. Though NYC sucks for pricing, the large job market does make it easier to find work. |-| 
|-| cnv30h6 || 5 || As someone who is living in the Silicon Valley (with wife and a toddler), a single income of $130,000 is enough to live comfortably and save a substantial sum every month.

Now obviously if you are single you can do a lot more by going in with a roommate + cooking occasionally etc. 

Without knowing too much of specifics about your lifestyle, I would guess that you will be able to improve your lifestyle + save more coming in from Dallas, TX.
 |-| 
|-| cnv3835 || 5 || &gt;How can I help my parents financially without risking to lose everything I have?

By offering the financial help you can afford to give. The way you write it, they dictate what "helping financially" means. They don't get to do that for you. You can tell them what you can afford to help with. If that is not want they *want*, then they don't have to take it. 

For example, maybe you have enough savings to front them 3 months rent or storage for a year for their belongings. This is not what they want - not even close. However, it *is* financial help. 

Just because a bank says you qualify doesn't mean you should take it. When we have bought homes the banks told us we could afford homes that were double what we asked for - they just assumed we'd never pay more than the interest on our credit card, never had to get a new car or major maintenance on our old cars, never went on a trip, never had a large house repair, never had to make ANY major purchase EVER for the next 30 years. I think they even assumed we'd default on our college loans. You know what you can afford.  |-| 
|-| cnv3dvy || 66 || HOld the fucking phone /r/personalfinance - I have some real advice. 

I spent some time thinking about your post because I did the exact same thing (houston to san jose) about 10 years ago. 

If the company that offered you a job is a start up, be very careful. I have seen this city create thousands of companies with millions in funding only to be shut down in months. If you do not have a back up job, IT IS NOT WORTH IT. 

Make sure you have an emergency fund that can manage surviving out here. 

Some jackass in this thread said you can get a 2br for less than 1k a month in San Jose. NO YOU CANT. 

I pay 3k/month rent in Willow Glen, a very well known safe neighborhood in San Jose. Its less of a neighborhood, and more of just "west/south san jose". That's for a 1000 sqft 2br house. 

If you want to move into a house, be ready to sign, seal, and deliver a shit ton of money the second it hits the listings. We had to pay 16,500 in first/last,deposit and 3 months rent up front in order to secure our listing. Was that legal? No. Do landlords here care? No. Not at all. 

This is a great town, but there is a shit ton that you need to know before you pull the trigger. Please PM me. I would HAPPILY chat with a fellow Texan on what to expect. 

You can live a great life in the Bay Area making 130k a year. Thats right about where I am. Expenses in all other areas other than rent are actually very similar to Dallas proper. Internet will run you about 60/month, cellular is the same. Utilities can vary depending on if you are in Santa Clara City vs San Jose.

|-| cnv3fzw || 3 || I'm in the process of doing this right now!  My girlfriend and I are moving to Toronto from NYC in April.  Toronto is one of the more expensive cities in Canada, but rent prices are 30% cheaper on average, and we will be able to afford renting our own one bedroom condo in the downtown core.  Much better than our current place in Manhattan, for roughly the same price.

There are extenuating circumstances here - my girlfriend is Canadian and I am wanting to move out of the States.  I was able to get location transferred to my company's office in Toronto in the same role I have now, which made it much easier.  

Even with the cost of airfare a few times a year to visit family, we are going to wind up way ahead in terms of our finances, versus what we had in NYC.

|-| cnv3ipl || 15 || I am divorced male without children and I moved from San Diego, CA to a small rural town in Kansas for the same reasons.  If I had stayed in San Diego, my small online business would not have been able to have enough profit to cover my expenses for living there.  I was able to buy a large, 5 bedroom home with a huge basement build in 1890 for 32,000 dollars.  It was large enough to store all the merchandise for my online store.  Now I have expanded and own a small coffee shop with a nice apartment downtown in our small town.  I have never been so happy.  And it is wonderful to be truly part of a community.  Our town has 2,000 people and I know a lot of them, and almost everyone knows me.  My family (brother and sister) still live in San Diego with their families.  I commute on holidays to visit them and get enough of San Diego to feel connected.  But the positives have definitely outweighed the negatives in this decision. |-|

|-| cnv4tvu || 3 || Here's my two cents. I left the Bay Area about 3 years ago after living there for 8 years. 

The Bay Area is great but $130 isn't going to buy you a lot. Let's talk housing... For a two bedroom appt. I'm thinking you'll be looking at at least $3k per month on the peninsula. So if you wanna save some cash you could move to the east bay but you'll have a brutal 2 hour commute every day.

Have or want kids? Full time employee sponsored daycare was $2k per month per kid when I left. I should also note that it went up 10% per year every year we were there.

So here's some quick math... $3k plus $4k (2 kids full time day care) is $7k per month or $84k after tax $$$ per year and you remember you haven't eaten yet. 

Still interested? Better find yourself a equally successful spouse if you want a shot of saving a few bucks or buying a new car anytime soon. 

I hope that helps!

|-| cnv511a || 59 || I was in the same position last year.  $65k salary in Scottsdale, AZ, moved to Silicon Valley January 2014 and got a $140k position.

For me it was definitely worth it.  I did the same as you - punching in numbers to all the calculators to see what I could find out.

What I can tell you from experience is that I took home 75% of my salary in AZ, ($65,000 * .75 = $48,750) and in Silicon Valley I take home 62% ($140,000 * .62 = $86,800.  Obviously even with cost of living increase I'm not going to spend an additional 40,000, so a lot of that is now just extra income.


I chose to live in a fairly expensive place because I wanted to be in a walkable city and right on the train lines, so my rent is $3,500/mo for a 2-bedroom. I split this 66/33 with my girlfriend, bringing my monthly rent to $2,310. 


The main thing I noticed is that while I do spend a little bit more on groceries and my taxes are higher (both because of new tax bracket and higher income tax rate), a lot of the things I spend money on are agnostic of location.  For instance, the prices of vacations I have wanted to take or things I want to buy off the internet have not gotten any more expensive, but I make roughly double (take home) what I used to make.


If you have any questions about the area, expenses, or the moving decision, feel free to PM me.  

Edit: I should also add that my job satisfaction is way, way higher here.  In AZ I hopped jobs about every 1-1.5 years to get a raise and make sure I was challenging myself.  I was always the person most committed to improving at my old jobs - here I am average at best.  My co-workers are all top-of-the-line and I learn in a month here what I would learn from my old jobs in a year.

In addition I could quit my job without notice and have a new, good job lined up within a week.  Something I probably couldn't say in Scottsdale. |-|

|-| cnv6r8a || 3 || OP I've done what you're looking to do, I have one piece of advice for you:
 
*Know what things that you like to do right now, make sure you live in a place that has those things.*

It sounds stupidly simple but there are many activities from my old life that I miss dearly. I've made the most of where I am, met some good friends, learned new things, and explored some interesting places, and don't regret it one bit. |-| 
|-| cnv71nd || 3 || There's a lot of misinformation on this thread.  Unless you have business expenses that will reduce your $2,200 to less than $400 (unlikely), you'll need to file a 1040 and Sch SE and pay self-employment taxes.  Based on the above facts alone, you will not pay any income tax.  See [1040 Instructions](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi.pdf), page 9, item 3.

|-| cnv7rwd || 5 || As an engineer in CA and frequent visitor to TX I can say that the day to day difference is quite low. Food, Utility bills (due to smaller homes in CA), entertainment no big differences.


The big differences I see:
1) Your new salary will increase your overall tax bracket. Roughly **$9,000** additional at your new income level. 


2) In CA you you pay about 8% in state income tax whereas TX does not have state income tax. (in TX this is offset with high property tax, but in CA we get to pay both due to the high cost of housing). This works out to about **$10,000** at your new rate.


3) You are basically looking at quadrupling the cost of an average home (on a $/sqft. basis). Say you own a $250,000 home in Dallas, to get the same home in around the Santa Clara area you will need to spend about $1,000,000 dollars. Assuming that the amount is not an issue and you get a loan you will be paying roughly for roughly $800,000 of additional carried debt and at a 4% interest rate this works out to about **$32,000** per year. 


9K+10K+32K=51K additional expenses. This makes your adjusted TX salary ~$79,000 or about a 10% raise from your current rate. Given those numbers I would make the decision based on where you want to live. CA is a wonderful place. It is busy, exciting, there are always things to do and Santa Clara is one of the most innovative places in the world. On the other hand if you like family life, more suburban living, owning land not just a house then TX may be more your speed.

|-| cnv8gd6 || 3 || I had a job offer in Manhattan that turned out to be a straight lateral after accounting for cost of living. And that was assuming nothing bad happened.

So I turned it down.

Jumping from 71 to 130 sounds like it would be doable, but it's good that you're checking.

I would check rental costs in the areas you want to live, income taxes based on the state and local schedules which should be online somewhere, and then ball park the rest of the expenses with an online calculator.

For my example, I jumped from something like 35% taxes (federal and state) to 50% (federal, state, and city), and while my transportation cost would have been less, if I wanted to save on rent, I would have to double the transportation...keep all those things in mind.

It helps to build out your current budget and the build out your ideal budget if you take the job, and then a much more cautious budget where you overestimate expenses. See where the variance is and where you might run into trouble. |-|

|-| cnv9cye || 8 || Your degree matters, but so do your skills. You can get a better job. If you're good at computers, start applying for entry level tech support type jobs. You seem to be good enough at writing, find a way to make that work for you. Try getting in with a non-profit doing grant writing or something similar. It'll get you contacts, at least. I personally believe contacts matter as least as much as skills or degrees.

I wish I knew of a blog aimed towards people in your situation. I have friends and family who would benefit. Maybe you can start your own blog. |-| 
|-| cnv9mq9 || 16 || &gt;Are there any blogs like the marvelous Mr. Money Mustache that are geared towards losers like me who make a pitiful pittance each year?


The first thing would be to stop being so self-deprecating, if you don't believe in yourself, why should anyone else?

1. Yes (but you have to do something about it)  
2. Get a job outside of the service industry  

If I were you, I would look at getting into the internet marketing/social media/advertising world STAT. I made it in with my Philosophy degree (arguably equally as useless) and do just fine. You have to be driven to get yourself into a place where you are paid well for the skills you provide.

|-| cnv9nsw || 6 || Too bad my employer has no intention on getting our W2's out until the 31st.  |-| 
|-| cnv9w0g || 3 || E-filed last Thursday. Received emails saying state and federal were accepted early but refund won't start being processed until the 20th.

Luckily my employer didn't wait until the 31st to give me my W-2.

It's also nice that they decided to let you e-file state taxes for free this year instead of charging $30. |-| 
|-| cnv9z61 || 11 || *raises hand* I'm at the point were I'll take any jobs, even if  I HATE it, to make around 40k.  I'm currently at 28k pretax and it's just too little to do anything significant with.  |-| 
|-| cnva4vq || -3 || Pay off your debt with the 75k in the bank and if there's any left over use it to buy a car?

I don't care how much money you make, debt is never good. You have a great income. Get out of debt ASAP and let that income really work wonders!  |-| 
|-| cnva5ik || 20 || Get over the self deprecating attitude and get out of the service industry. Don't wait for a promotion there. What do you think your end game is in the service industry? It doesn't exist. Those skills are transferable no where.

Get an office job. They really, really, really are not that hard to get. Do admin work or work at a law firm doing file clerk type work. Apply to anything that sounds interesting and uses a computer. You'll be amazed at how fast you can grow within a company if you know how to use Google fairly well. |-| 
|-| cnva6zb || 193 || Just remember, people with low incomes are much less likely to post about it on the internet.  Coupled with a whole lot of e-bragging, and there are plenty of people who make much less than 50k per year.  |-| 
|-| cnvaaq3 || 5 || Maybe im missing something but what exactly is free? It seems every year I've used turbo tax I end up paying $60-70 to file. I only make 50k and have one W2, how do I go about using it and filing for free? |-| 
|-| cnvab28 || -3 || Drive it off a cliff and let your fam collect life insurance.  |-| 
|-| cnvabg1 || 4 || There are jobs out there that only require a college degree that don't care about your major. I personally haven't ever had one of these jobs, but I know somebody who got started working one and now he's about to be promoted to a position where he'll make more than $80k a year at the age of 31. He was a claims representative for a large insurance company, then used that position to get into a more lucrative field. |-| 
|-| cnvaeik || 232 || No, but I think you're the only one who hasn't inherited $300k from a long lost aunt this week.   |-| 
|-| cnvaer4 || 3 || 1)  Yes.  

2)  Do you want to be in the service industry?  If so, find out how to advance in that field - there are many better paying service industry jobs.  If not, find something you actually want to do and just go do it.  Given your current income, making a career change wouldn't exactly be risky.  You don't have much to lose.

3a)  MMM isn't geared towards losers; it's geared towards people who want to move away from our wasteful, consumerist culture and live more sustainable, meaningful lives.

3b)  You're not a loser. |-| 
|-| cnvaft5 || 139 || Hey, cut that shit out. Seriously. I'm not gonna be nice about it--you need to stop acting like you fail as a human being because you don't make all that much money. I bet you are an extremely hard worker and many employers would love to have you. Problem is, they don't know it and you don't have connections relevant to your intended career path so it's hard to actually get noticed. Contact your university and see if they have a career center or do any career fairs that you can attend (I know my university allows alumni to use their career services for 1.5 years after graduation). Consider relocating if it will mean a better job. Consider picking up a trade. Lots of guys (by guys I don't explicitly mean males even though they normally are) get certifications for non-destructive testing and things like that in Houston and start at a solid $40k or so, and they have plenty of room to go up. You can always try to get a more secretarial or administrative job at a major oil and gas company and work your butt off so they value you as an employee, then tell them you are interested in pursuing a new degree plan that will allow you to advance in the company.

Here's an example. A good friend of mine got a music degree from LSU and partied her ass off for literally as long as she could. She bounced around from job to job until she got a job as a secretary at a mom and pop engineering firm. The engineers valued her hard work as an administrative person and knew her work ethic would continue if she moved up. When the small company dissolved it was mostly absorbed by Exxon. The engineers insisted that she come with them, so Exxon hired her. She was prompted to get her engineering degree, which she did over the next 4-5 years, and we both graduated from University of Houston in May and now she makes well over $100k.

What I'm saying is, even if you're doing basic unskilled jobs, try to wedge yourself into a position where you can move up when your hard work is noticed. And by "move up" I don't mean going from selling socks at the department store to managing the sock department. I'm not talking about a career advancement, I'm talking about arranging the opportunity to hop on a different career ladder altogether. |-| 
|-| cnval7n || 5 || I'm 32 and I only make 45k. At 25, I made 29k and in my early 20s I made around 20k. I could probably be in a higher paying career, but I like my job. Now, if you want to make more money you need to get out of retail (unless you go into the corporate side). You need to start looking for entry level jobs in different fields, like insurance, HR, IT, etc and with the government (if you like public service).  |-| 
|-| cnvam17 || 14 || I was in a very similar situation to you at your age so I'll chime in my $.02:


1.  Stop feeling sorry for yourself.  When I got out of school, I just thought landing a job would be so easy.  Unfortunately, I graduated in 2009 - right when everything was going to shit.  And I was looking for work in advertising.  You know what portion of a budget gets cut first in an economic downturn a lot?  You guessed right - the advertising budget.  I just 'gave up' on landing the job 'i deserved.'  So, as a result I took on a shit job that paid me less than I was making at my shit job in college!  For me, I got over this my moving across the country and hitting the reset button.  Obviously, not everyone can do this, but you can hit reset where you currently live and start applying.


2.  Stop undervaluing yourself.  I know it's hard to see beyond "all my work experience is in the service industry."  I get it.  I came from a similar situation.  You need to sit down and then of all the experience you have that is transferable.  Custom service / resolution.  Excels in fast-paced setting.  Highly adept to quickly changing situations / environments.  Excels in team settings.  Companies eat this shit up, you just have to promote yourself better.  Trust me.  I didn't get out of the service industry until I was 27 and let me tell you that you have skills desirable to employers - even if it is just an entry level position.


3.  Where to find work?  Now that you have your newly spruced up resume, hit the classifieds.  I.E. - your linked ins and other online resources.  Find recruiters pages and introduce yourself to them.  If they can get you a job, it is a win win for both parties.  Do a google search of the city you currently live in and see if there have been any recent (or upcoming) companies opening offices in your area.  I've gotten two jobs this way.


Anyway, you just need to view your situation in a different light and seek out opportunities.  Find someone with a great work history that you trust to help you build your resume.  I have a highly successful uncle who deals with hirings a lot and knows what to look for.  I shot him my resume, and he did some revisions - and let me tell you that his outlook - aka his ability to read between the lines and 'tweak' the language of my resume gave me SUCH a boost in confidence.  Hopefully this helps - and feel free to reach out if you need anything else! |-| 
|-| cnvaolw || -5 || Pro tip you can also get your taxes done for free if you bang a CPA.

Worked for me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ |-| 
|-| cnvaydi || 5 || I was in your position at your age. I was earning 12/hr doing basic admin jobs with a business admin degree. The biggest thing that held me back from earning a respectable salary was my hometown that I was living and working in. It was a decent suburb with pockets of wealth but it wasn't a thriving city for young professionals.

I took a leap of faith when I was 26 and applied in major cities all over the country. During phone interviews, HR would ask my salary requirements and I said 35K, which is a pretty good salary in my hometown. They were taken aback by how little I asked and actually suggested I ask for more.

I landed a job in DC and started out at 45k which felt like hitting the lottery coming from 12/hr. Within that same year I received a raise up to 50k. In my hometown I'd be happy retiring earning 50k. Just simply moving to where the grass is greener bumped up my salary ALOT. My only regret is not moving sooner after college.

 |-| 
|-| cnvazjm || 13 || Be wary here because one of the things they hide on you is the cost of doing the refi.  It's not uncommon for it to cost you several thousand dollars to do the refi, and of course the lender is happy to roll that up into the loan so you don't really see it. |-| 
|-| cnvb427 || 17 || At risk of sounding like I'm judging you (which I'm not)...$19,000 a year is getting pretty close to the poverty line.  That's about $9 bucks an hour, give or take, on a fulltime-equivalent basis.

At this income level, you'd be *much* better off trying to find a higher paying job than you would trying to save money.

If I were you I wouldn't be below applying to internships that are geared for college kids...when I was interning during college I made $16 an hour.  Hit up big Fortune 500 companies and apply for every single entry level job you can.  Literally all you need to know is how to use excel, and you can do the job. |-| 
|-| cnvbaqd || 49 || This subreddit is not a representative sample of the country. A population that cares about/is knowledgeable about personal finance is going to naturally skew to higher earners. The fact that you're reading this is a good sign that you too could eventually be in a similar situation. |-| 
|-| cnvbfop || 8 || I get why posts about "i have more money than I know what to do with" stand out to you, but I'd bet there are more "how do i afford food and student loans" or "how do i save up enough to move out" posts than those.  |-| 
|-| cnvboae || 5 || For your age you're not really too far behind. Most people don't really settle into career type jobs until late 20s or 30s.  Just focus on laying out a path for yourself that will get you to a career with "adult" type pay sometime in the next few years.  |-| 
|-| cnvbq2c || 5 || I don't have a lot to add but I just wanted to let you know I'm right there with you. I'm 3 years out of school with a Communications degree. Currently making 25k at my 8-5 job and another 3-5k working some unrelated part-time stuff. 

The toughest part for me is carving out free time to learn new skills or apply to new jobs. I'm already working 2 jobs just to make ends meet, and that leaves me with very little free time. If I get an hour of free time at the end of the day, I want to spend it mindlessly watching Netflix, not trying to better myself. It's a tough trap to fall into. |-| 
|-| cnvbvks || 3 || What I would recommend is start applying for jobs online. Develop your resume, take a few shots at some jobs, get on some interviews, start marketing yourself. Make this a habit after work and on the weekends. 

MOST important I would use your network. Call your friends. Call your parents. Call your friends' siblings you have a relationship with. Ask them to push your (now) polished resume to the right people. 

Your network is your net-worth. Use it to your advantage. Even if you have to move out of state for a job at a company your parents' old friend works at. Do it for a couple years to gain experience, you can always move back. |-| 
|-| cnvc9cp || 3 || You've gotten a lot of replies already. Just wanted to say congrats, and it's well worth it even if your income:expense ratio isn't changed much. Lots of great opportunities in general and your standard of living will increase. |-| 
|-| cnvchz2 || 3 || Really... how did you get that job if you can't even google or use zillow to find housing and merch costs.  I mean that's almost double and your cost of living is not going to double unless you let it double.  |-| 
|-| cnvcsrg || 4 || Absolutely critical step number one: Never again refer to yourself as a loser, just because you haven't hit the paycheck moneyball.

It's clear from your post that you have both intelligence and a competent grasp of written language. Believe me when I say there are many people making multiples of $50k per year to whom those attributes do not apply.

At 25, educated and possessing a decent work ethic, you are well situated to begin climbing the ladder. First, you have to find a ladder to climb. Not everyone finds it by 25, and that's perfectly OK. |-| 
|-| cnvdif7 || 9 || I never answer anything on my cell if it's an unknown number. After any of those calls, I Google the number and if it's even remotely sketchy there will be at least a dozen other people complaining about it. Block &amp; done. |-| 
|-| cnvdn86 || 3 || You're 25.  Calm down and you have time.  You don't really say what you do but I would suggest working with career counselors at your alma mater and exploring the local job scene (young professional associations, etc.).  Obviously you aren't happy with where you are at but if you're young and driven your income will rise.  

Also your income is not a reflection of who you are by any means.  My brother is around your age and makes close to what you do.  I make around 4x what he does.  But he works with high risk young in an orphanage in Cincinnati.  I work at a tech company trying to make said company more cash.  I don't think there would be much argument with who is adding more to society :-) |-| 
|-| cnvdtcs || 11 || Go back to school for nursing or accounting or something marketable.

DO NOT go to law school. |-| 
|-| cnvelz7 || 6 || 1) You're required to make quarterly payments when you're a 1099. The IRS knows that a lot of 1099ers don't know/don't know how the first time, so there's no penalty for messing up your first year. Don't sweat it.

2) Regarding the laptop...you could deduct it from your taxes if you itemize. You're SOL if you take a standard deduction though.

3) I'd contact your state labor board about being misclassified. There's a lot of stipulations about who falls under that designation, and the biggest one is that 1099s generally set their own hours. You can say you'll work 8 hours a day, but the company cannot tell you that you need to work 9-5, or 8-4, etc. |-| 
|-| cnvezcf || 5 || Everyone look up the statute of limitations for debt in their state. If you owe on something outside the sol and don't feel like paying it (this is a personal finance subreddit, not an ethics one), calmly tell whoever you're speaking with "I have an absolute defense-this debt is past the statute of limitations. Do not correspond with me ever again." If they keep pushing, follow it with "fuck you". |-|

|-| cnvfra3 || 3 || I have the Double Cash card and I like it a lot. Be aware that your second 1% in cash back is delayed one month, as it is applied after you pay the balance.

Getting gift cards is a 1 to 1 exchange.

Here is a list of the possible gift cards:

**Eateries:**

Chili's  
Longhorn Steakhouse  
Olive Garden  
Panera Bread  
Red Lobster  
Starbucks  
TGI Fridays  

**Retail:**  

Amazon  
Barnes and Noble  
Bath and Body Works  
Best Buy  
Bed Bath and Beyond  
Bloomingdales  
CVS Pharmacy  
Kohl's  
Lowe's  
Macy's  
Sears  
Wal Mart  
Home Depot

**Entertainment:**

Regal  
iTunes |-| 
|-| cnvg1rr || 7 || I would advise against doing gift cards in general, if the card has an option of a statement credit. There are too many ways you could lose a gift card, such as before it even gets to you in the mail, that you will not be reimbursed for by the card company. With a statement credit there is nothing to be lost, even if it doesn't feel as gratifying as holding the card in your hands. 

If you're interested in rewards, I would definitely look at getting a Chase Freedom and Discover IT card, in addition to a Citi Double Cash. Freedom and IT both have rotating categories which offer 5% back. For Q1 2015, Freedom is 5% at grocery stores, and IT is 5% on gas. Use Citi card for other purchases. |-| 
|-| cnvg6l8 || 3 || If you have Discover and Citi Double Cash, you might also want to look at the Sallie Mae Mastercard.  It returns 5% rewards for gas (up to $250 spending per month), groceries (also $250), and books (which includes most Amazon purchases, $750 limit here).

For the Double Cash, buying gift cards doesn't really net you anything extra.  It's 2% either way.  However, you can get *some* gift cards on Amazon for 5% cash rewards.  The AARP credit card (anyone can get it) is also currently 3% on restaurants if you eat out a lot. |-| 
|-| cnvgibe || 4 || You make 215k a year and have 75k in the bank.

Seems kind of bizarre to me to even be wasting your time trying to get a 6-9k auto loan.

But employment history is a big deal when getting a loan so being at an employer for a short time is an easy explanation to not getting approved. |-| 
|-| cnvij7g || 5 || I have the Double Cash card, and I love it. As far as a bonus for redeeming for gift cards, I have only ever seen one such bonus (it was $90 in cash back for a $100 card of a specific restaurant). The other 99% of the time, it's straight 1-to-1 redemption.

I would also consider not exchanging for gift cards, even if you want to treat yourself to special night out with your wife. I would redeem for a check, and then just use your card. Here's why. Let's say you spend $2500 and get $50 in cash back. Option one is to redeem for a gift card and treat your spouse to a nice meal. Option two is to get the $50 in your bank account, then pay for the nice meal with your Double Cash card. That gives you another $1 in cash back from that meal. Not a lot, but it can certainly add up.

Use these:

- Spartan International Index Fund - Fidelity Advantage Class Symbol: FSIVX .17%
- Spartan Total Market Index Fund - Fidelity Advantage Class Symbol: FSTVX .07%
- Spartan U.S. Bond Index Fund - Fidelity Advantage Class Symbol: FSITX .17%

Great plan so that's all you need!  The guide will help you figure out percentages, etc.

You didn't say anything about that. I'm not telling you to "find your passion and follow it", that always sounded like bullshit to me and still does, without knowing what it is you'd like to do, you're only going to get generic responses that you can find on any self-help forum or blog. Wanting to go into business is different from going into programming which is different from going into marketing. And I think that knowing that will give you better advice if you asked. |-|

During 2013 my gross annual income was $800. As of 2014 I'm making 45K, and will move up to 50K within the next 4 months. Best advice in my limited experience is to shoot for jobs within your state government, assuming you live in the US. There will be many automated rejection letters, and much interviewing. Ultimately though, if you're able to sell the tools you gained while getting that sociology degree (ability to analyze large bodies of information, writing skills, ect...) you will find a job suited to you that pays in the range you want. Persistence, and ability to see your degree as something other than a giant mistake, are key though. I wish you the best of luck fellow humanities grad.  |-| 
|-| cnvt4rn || 3 || It's better to go with a reputable company as opposed to a small independent company seeing as they could have hidden clauses within their policy. I personally use USAA and they're great, although you have to have some sort of Military affiliation to utilize them as an Insurance. I would get a quote from some of the major ones and play the whole, "Well this company quoted me at &lt;insert lower price than what they're offering&gt; and 9/10 said company will try to earn your business by throwing out a competitive rate. Try to avoid adding options that you feel you won't need if they're offering them to you. I use Towing coverage, Rental car reimbursement and roadside assistance. It's really a matter of preference and how much the company actually covers if something happens. |-| 
|-| cnvuowz || 8 || Yes.  This is a good planning tool if you live in a state that bills you for your property taxes before the end of the year and lets you pay them any time before January 15th or 31st of the following year.  (Not all states allow you to do this.)  It typically works best for people who have no mortgage and live in a state with low or no state income tax.

If you typically make regular charitable contributions, make them in the same years to preserve their deduction as well.  

For instance, if you pick odd years to itemize, you'd pay your 2014 Property Taxes in January of 2015 and your 2015 Property Taxes before December 31, 2015, make all your charitable contributions in 2015 as well, and then take the standard deduction in 2014 and 2016.  Continue with 2017. |-| 
|-| cnvvn7y || 4 || What state are you in, what kind of debt is it and when was the last day you made payment or "accepted" the debt. Those are the controlling factors.

Example: You are in Texas and it is credit card debt you have not made a payment on (or "accepted") in 5 years, this is zombie debt. They stand no chance of collections nor can they provide a negative report to the credit agencies. They can try to collect but they have no leverage over you and a simple so contact letter ends it.

The original negative report may remain on your credit report for 2 more years but that is it. |-| 
|-| cnvynnb || 9 || US resident here. Our laws will differ on this, but I would get a lawyer and accountant involved for advice ASAP. Also, check your personal credit, and find out if there's anything else in your name that shouldn't be.

|-| cnx5wyh || 43 || Other people may have more to say about big-picture stuff, but as a parent let me chime in on some more pedestrian things.

Having a baby ends up being expensive for a lot of people, but some of the expenses are avoidable.  The retail market is full of baby STUFF.  Some of it is useful &amp; convenient, but a lot of it just isn't necessary.  Don't let marketing make you feel like you're not "providing" for your child unless you get the nicest stroller, the vibrating bouncy seat, the fancy diaper disposal system, the european baby carrier, the intelligence-boosting play mat, etc etc etc.

Wait and see what you need before you buy it.  Listen to what other parents tell you they find essential, but also keep in mind that babies differ, and that sometimes people push products because they're  justifying their own choices.  Know you can get a ton of this kind of stuff secondhand via garage sales, craigslist, and consignment stores, still in great shape.

This topic can be fraught with implied judgment, but the plain fact is that if your GF can &amp; does breastfeed, you can save a ton of money not buying formula.  If this is what you decide on, know that partner support can be critical in this when the going gets tough (and it will).  Learn what you can and be there for her.  

Get in the habit of saving for college.  It may seem impossible, but if you start now (even a small amount) that money has 18 years to grow.  Yay compound interest.  If you start a 529 plan, those are relatively easy for well-meaning relatives to contribute to as well.

This is the toughest but greatest journey you'll ever embark on.  Congratulations.  This baby is fortunate already to have a father who is thinking ahead. |-|

|-| cnx69qo || 4 || When my kids were little, I garage saled every weekend, bought clean, name brand clothing on the cheap, shoes, toys too. We bought sizes in all ranges and kept a closet full of clothes and toys. We rotated toys in and out of that closet. It was good therapy for me to get out, our oldest daughter was 10 and learned to haggle!  |-| 
|-| cnx6fci || 7 || Given the circumstances, you're in a fortunate situation. This should be a wake up call, though. Are your career prospects good with your current major? It's tough enough to start out alone after college, let alone with a family of three. Your costs are low right now, but that can't and shouldn't last forever. I think you need to keep a laser-eye focus on trying to maximize your potential wages. Since you're still in college and blessed with family support, you have time to do so. |-| 
|-| cnx6fcr || 22 || Just wanted to give you a general comment from another parent OP, but if she's due in September she's (edit) still very early in the pregnancy. Before you go making a huge living change you need to give the dust time to settle. Also, being horribly realistic the statistic is that one in five-ish pregnancies will miscarry (actually it's one in three if you include the ones too early to detect). Give it a few weeks here before making anything final. |-| 
|-| cnx6mp4 || 8 || What does her insurance situation look like?  I'm assuming she's still on her parent's insurance as a full time college student?

|-| cnx7rp0 || 4 || get married. Nobody will probably suggest this, since it's not "politically correct" to do so, but it makes sense if only from a financial standpoint. 

People were having kids in their teens in the past, and made it work. Just adjust your expectations for living standards for the time being, and tough it out. You can do it.  |-| 
|-| cnx7sco || 13 || I keep $13,000 in an emergency fund. That's about 4-5 months. Difference is I keep it in a conservative fund with 30% stock, 70% bond and I need only 10K for those 4-5 months. The extra 30% is a buffer in case of a crash and I transfer out any money that goes over the 30%. Single, no kids. Income of 70K per year.  |-| 
|-| cnx7w2x || 14 || Right now it's $1000 while I pay off a private student loan. Once that is done, 3 months of expenses. My job is super stable and I have more than six months of paid time off accrued if anything happened.  |-| 
|-| cnx7zl0 || -4 || 401k is probably a good bet simply because they are designed for long term growth.  Otherwise an index fund would be a fairly safe investment. |-| 
|-| cnx7zmk || 223 || That was actually a pretty clever solution. Thanks for posting! |-| 
|-| cnx80fa || 3 || We have between 5 and 6 months of current* monthly expenses. We are growing it slowly, but not urgently, and will stop at 6 months. Likely it'll take about a $1.5K hit to pay Uncle Sam when we file taxes (mitigated somewhat by our state tax anticipated refund). We're married with a young child.

*Our current expenses include paying &gt; $400 above minimums on student loans, housecleaners, fancy cable w/DVR, lots of cell data, $20/month for 2 Spotify accounts. In other words, this is all stuff we'd cut out in an emergency. Also, if one of us lost our job longer-term we could likely scale back to at least part-time daycare. Also, we'd stop putting 18% each into our 401(K)s. |-| 
|-| cnx80pj || 4 || My advise is: open a separate account for the baby.

This is the baby's expense for everything he/she will need: diapers, wipes, formula, baby bath stuff (baby clothes?)

Put away money NOW. The more you have in this account, the better. Be discipline and do not touch this money unless for the baby. 

This worked wonders for our two boys. Only setback I had is that i started when my first boy was already born. They still have their own separate accounts till this day. It's their own spending money.  |-| 
|-| cnx89rz || 65 || So just to clarify: You could avoid the mile overage charge by buying out the lease (purchasing the car)? Then you just turned around and sold it to CarMax?

Pretty sweet. You probably are still out a lot more money than you would have been if you didn't lease a car in the first place ;-D |-| 
|-| cnx8a9c || 3 || I only keep ~$5k, or 3 months of living expenses. Stable job. Single as far as financial support is concerned. |-| 
|-| cnx8apa || 3 || Sorry for your loss.  

I'd max out the 401k contributions for the year.  You're probably over the IRA limits so you could only backdoor a Roth.  Set aside a bunch for emergency fund and set up a brokerage with the balance.  

It might help if you started to re-imagine your liquid savings as an eventual down payment on a house.  

 |-| 
|-| cnx8deh || 9 || My super generous grandparents gave us grandkids each $1k from a recent timber sale. This was a huge help to my emergency account, and I'm really thankful. Yay for random pieces of family land in the middle of nowhere!

Also, I'm opening an Ally savings account. I have a Wells Fargo savings account now which gets a piddly 0.01%. I know Ally's 0.99% is nothing to write home about, but it's better than nothing (which is essentially what WF is giving me). |-| 
|-| cnx8g4q || 20 || You should absolutely max out the 401k. In fact, I don't quite get why people invest in normal brokerage accounts when they still have any space left in their 401k. The tax benfits are just such an incredible gift from the government, I don't know why anyone would bypass them and choose to invest in normal taxable accounts. (Unless the funds in your 401k have expense rations above like 2%).

So yeah, to summarize I'd increase contributions to your 401k to max it out each year moving forward. That's only probably $12k this year above what you are currently contributing though. Then I'd keep enough in a savings account for your short term spending goals (emergency fund + entertainment + new car). I'd keep another $12k to allow you to maximize your 401k *next* year as well. The rest I would invest in normal taxable accounts. |-| 
|-| cnx8sks || 6 || It's just a matter of persistence. This time of year any organization dealing with taxes is going to be swamped to the point of barely being able to function. That letter your wife got was probably mailed to a couple million people, all of whom are trying to sign up for the same thing at the same time. |-| 
|-| cnx93ug || 4 || I would strongly suggest going to a Credit Union in Cedar Falls, which are much easier to work with than banks. You'll probably be able to open a new checking/savings account, and get a credit card, at the same time. They can also probably assist you with opening an IRA. 

My only advice: avoid taking on unnecessary debt. You'll be confronted with so many "EASY CREDIT!" options for paying for everything - from electronics, to clothing, to (fill in the blank). Debt is the American way. AVOID IT. Goodluck! |-|

|-| cnx9aax || 4 || * Checking accounts: https://www.cfccu.org/ or http://www.myfnbbank.com/ or https://bankiowa.com/

* Credit: Secured credit cards are a good way to start. You can get one through your bank or choose one with a major CC company.

* Taxes: You don't really need a book or anything. Basically, when you go to work, they will take taxes out of your paycheck. Around this time of year, you get some paperwork back, and you can use a free online filing service to answer basic questions. If you paid too much taxes, the government will send you a check, or you may have to pay a little if you did not pay enough.

* IRA: This is a type of **retirement** savings account. Read the FAQ for an explanation and suggestions of where to open one. You cannot contribute money to the IRA unless you are earning income here. You do not have to be a citizen to contribute, only have a job.

* Financial mistakes: Do not take on debt. Track your expenses, because a lot of times people get into bad financial positions simply because they don't know where their money goes. |-| 
|-| cnx9g4s || 3 || * Checking and Savings: see our Wiki/FAQ on Financial Institutions, maybe that will help. There are lots of banks all over, and you can usually find the one that is best for you. General recommended are small/local banks, online only banks, and credit unions.

* Credit: we actually have a credit building FAQ! That is a good place to get started.

* Taxes: you will generally have your money *withheld* at a rate that best matches your current income. At the end of the year, you will get forms in to file taxes. /u/taxmankeith: can you offer help explaining taxes to a newbie?

* IRAs: they are a tax deferred account that will help you save for retirement. Take a look at our FAQ on IRAs and retirement accounts. Generally you cannot save in an IRA unless you have declared income.

* General rules of thumb:  
    * Own a budget. Track all your expenses.
    * Never spend more than you can afford.
    * WRT credit, always pay your statement balance in full every month,  and only use credit for planned expenses.
    * Have an emergency fund for 6 months of expenses. |-|

* Since we have combined incomes and her stipend income could cover higher payments, I went for the 10 year repayment plan, automated payments (to get .25% interst waived), added an additional amounts to the monthly payment (total monthly payment = $1500). 
* After doing this for a few months, the total monthly dues have been cut down drastically by 50% but we're still paying the $1500 so some 70% to 80% is going principal.

|-| cnx9zbl || 3 || I wanted to mention two other tax-advantaged options that you might want to consider (they won't necessarily be appropriate for you).  These would be steps that you would take only after (1) maxing out your 401k and IRA contributions and (2) replenishing your emergency fund (and perhaps beefing it up to cover six months' worth of expenses.


First, if you have kids, think you might ever have kids, or are thinking about going to grad school, you can stash money in a 529.  Money in a 529 grows tax-free (with respect to federal taxes).  And there may be other tax advantages depending upon your state of residence.  


Second, if you have a qualifying high deductible health insurance plan through work, you can put the money in an HSA.  If you let the money stay in the HSA and just pay run-of-the-mill health care expenses out of pocket, the HSA is sort of like an additional IRA.  For details: https://www.betterment.com/resources/life/truth-about-hsas-and-retirement/  |-| 
|-| cnxa1vd || 7 || Wouldn't it be better to take a loan against your 401k than remove the money with penalty?   |-| 
|-| cnxa4hn || 17 || Based on some of the comments, I think some of the folks are misunderstanding how this works.  CarMax does not pay you and then you pay off the lease company.  CarMax directly pays off the leasing company and any extra is money for you.  This is great if you are looking to sell your lease because selling it to CarMax does not subject you to sales tax.  If you tried to sell it to a person you would likely owe sales tax.

Take this all with a grain of salt though, and you results may vary.  I took my car to CarMax 6 months ago because I wanted to get out of my lease.  CarMax quoted me at around 2k under what I still owed, so I decided to walk away.  I am hoping to take it again this summer and see if their offer is closer to what I owe. |-| 
|-| cnxa4mg || 7 || For the past 10 years, I've had an investment account with Schwab that was originally the money my parents had saved for me for college. We ended up not needing it after my dad's company took off, so once I graduated they put the account in my name as a jump start on my savings. It was about 30k. I never considered the money "mine", just some number in an account, but a few years ago before I took PF seriously, I got behind on some credit cards and ended up with a balance of about $1500 that I couldn't get down. I took that amount out of my Schwab account to pay it. Since then, I've discovered this sub, YNAB, and have built up a sizeable emergency fund. Just this week I "paid myself back" and put that same amount into my Schwab account to make up for what I did. I'm still not making a whole lot and it takes me a long time to save, but it felt good putting that money back while still having a sizable emergency fund left over.  |-|

Just like with the breastfeeding there's no shame if you're unable to do it. There are several charities that can send you cloth diapers for simply the shipping fee to and from your home. And then you can even buy some of your own which you can either later sell to recoup your investment. Here are some links to the topic.

|-| cnxafe3 || 6 || OK, so do you have a K-1 visa?

|-| cnxahqj || 7 || The absolute most important thing is for both of you to finish college and get good jobs. Married or not, do everything you can to support your girlfriend to get a successful launch into her career. 

If food, rent and medical expenses are covered for you, and your families will likely throw you a baby shower, you are going to be covered for some immediate expenses. Resist the urge to buy tons of baby crap. Shop second hand and consignment. Clothing may literally be worn once before it is out grown. Don't put lots of money into it. 

The one big one you haven't considered is child care. See if your (new) university has onsite day care, and how much it costs. If your university doesn't have any kind of discounted day care programs for students, start looking around. 

The cost for infants can easily be $1500/mo. (which generally goes down at 6 months) This is where the "make or break" point comes for if it is worth while for both parents to work while day care is so expensive. 

If you're lucky enough, you'll have enough flexibility in your schedules and enough family around to allow you to have no day care costs until one of you has a full time job in your degree area. Keep in mind, that "real" job could be 6 months or a year or more out of school. 

Talk about how you're going to share parenting duties. You don't talk about living together or getting married. It's tough to truly share parenting if you're not going to be around to let mom get some sleep after a night of breastfeeding, or changing a 2am diaper. See if your parents would be amenable to letting all three of you stay in one house. This would also allow you to not need 2 houses worth of stuff.  |-|

I'd just finished *Your Money or Your Life* and it occurred to me that this money could do a lot more for me in life if I put it to work ASAP instead of tossing it into a house. So I explained to him my goal of working toward financial independence and how I'd already calculated my net worth, value of my time and started tracking expenses/budgeting and he was super impressed so he agreed to pay it out now in two chunks (to avoid a big tax hit).

First $12.5k

* Eliminated all high interest debt
* $6k in savings leftover to start my emergency fund &amp; cover a vacation next month

Next $12.5k

* Will cover the rest of my car loan
* Should have at least $1k per month leftover to go straight into savings/401k
* Have only just begun to trim monthly expenses, great progress so far
* Living on 60% or less of my monthly income should be a reality by mid-year

2015's gonna be a good year!

|-| cnxb071 || -4 || &gt;you still may have positive equity in it,

This doesn't add up, with 9 months left the buyout from the dealership should have been a lot higher than KBB value, they don't just forgive the rest of the lease payments when you buyout early because the depreciation is spread through the entire time of the lease. There's a reason shorter leases are a lot more expensive, and by buying out early you got a defacto shorter lease term, and as such should have had to make up the difference.

|-| cnxbus6 || 9 || Single, no debt, no kids, 95k/year. I keep 30k in a cash bank account. Once that goes up towards 40 i move a bunch into investments. I could probably survive close to a year on 30k. |-| 
|-| cnxbv4f || 9 || You're going to be having a baby in September. That means you *just* found out, right? 

First thing to do, from a /r/personalfinance perspective, is to post up a budget, including both incomes, *all* expenses, and *all* debts, including amounts remaining, interest rates, and minimum payments.

You say food and living costs will be taken care of by your parents, but other things often recommended for you to cut back on are your phone bills, car payments, and entertainment. You need to save every spare dollar, and you need to start *right now*.

She's still on her parents' insurance? Great. She needs to go to every prenatal doctor appointment. Depending on her insurance plan, these can be spendy. Prenatal vitamins and other things she might need? You'll need to pay for these too. For some people, the birth itself puts you at your out-of-pocket maximum, in the US. You need to know what that number is, and you need to save at least that much. Trust me, I have a daughter with congenital heart defects. We reach our out-of-pocket max ***EVERY YEAR*** and will continue to do so until she's 26, if the current laws stay in place.

As far as things you'll need to buy for the baby, here's my sincere advice:

Your baby needs three things: shelter, food, and something to catch his/her poop. If you ask anyone who lived through the Great Depression in the 30s, a common story is that a baby slept in a dresser drawer, lined with a blanket. I believe it. Newborns don't move much. 

The point I'm trying to make is that you can pretty much ignore advertising and other judgy parents.

One thing you should buy new is a car seat. Here's the thing about those though: Every single safety seat needs to pass the same tests to be sold legally. This is one thing you can buy the absolute cheapest, and you can be certain it will do its job as intended. Buy a Cosco seat from Walmart. Ignore the judgy looks from sanctimonious parents with $400 seats.

*Literally everything else, buy used.*

Used baby clothes can be found that still have the price tags on. Babies grow so fast, and often, parents buy or are given clothes that either are too small by the first time they're put on, or they're washed once or twice. Buy one new outfit to bring the baby home, if you want, it's sentimental. But everything else, used for sure.

Cribs, toys, pack-n-plays, strollers, used used used. Craigslist and Just Between Friends are your best allies here. Is something stained a little? Who cares. Your kid will stain it more. Use that as a haggling point and get a cheaper price.

If you do go somewhere like Babies-r-Us, keep this rule in mind: "If my parents didn't have one when I was growing up, I don't need it." This will keep you from buying *TONS* of stuff you don't need. So many things have been invented and sold in the name of "safety" that are just flat out unnecessary.

You mentioned she's going to try to breastfeed. Awesome! Health-wise, it's the best for your kid, but this is /r/personalfinance. The best thing about it is: It's free. Your GF's body is going to make the best quality milk out of whatever she eats. Yes, it's best if she eats well, but don't worry if you can't afford it. Also, your insurance *will* pay for a breast pump. They are requred to, by law, now. Will they pay for the one you really want? Maybe. Again, trust me here, she'll want an electric one. Also, get some pumping bras, so she can do it hands-free. 

You may want to consider buying cloth diapers. Up front, they can cost a few hundred, but month-to-month, they are free. You will have a slightly higher water and laundry detergent bill. There are even Facebook groups where you can buy and sell used ones, and you can make back some of the upfront cost. Or, if you ever have a second kid, hold on to them! Free diapers for #2!

Also, remember that friends and family will want to give you things. Don't buy anything until you find out what you're going to get for free first. |-| 
|-| cnxbxuq || -4 || That is why you buy Toyota's, right there folks!  Resale value is second to none!

* I've got a great spreadsheet built projecting expenditures and savings through the year. I've also found that staying on top of my finances with Excel/Mint and reading /r/personalfinance daily has really done a lot to improve my financial confidence. **Thanks for the help folks, you've got me really motivated.** |-|

|-| cnxcnn4 || 4 || About $2000.

My "emergency fund" and the taxable portion of my retirement accounts are one and the same. The $2000 is to cover any emergent expense that requires me to pay cash. For example, if my car gets towed, an impound lot won't accept checks or credit cards! I'm not sure why that is, but that's how it goes. 

Everything else I can think of could either go on a credit card or wait a few days to sell some index fund shares. My credit card limit is about six months worth of expenses, and I have another line of credit worth *another* six months. I'd put expenses on there, sell shares, pay the card or loan before it's due, and pay no interest. 

Yes, this is risky. I could have a major emergency or job loss in a down market, sure. But I'm only 26. I'm currently gunning hard for financial independence by 45. If that major tragedy happens in that down market, I'll just work a few more years. It's worth the risk, to me. |-|

|-| cnxct3e || 3 || first off: Welcome to the united states and congrates on the wedding. Just so you know English is overwhelming dominate here compared to Dutch tongues.

Checking account:
Chase bank is offering free checking for joint accounts and you get one free solo account with it included. That is what I use.

Credit:
ok, so you are going to be here legally. Yes? Good. The moment you have a bank account open and are legally allowed to be here you are going to get swamped by credit card offers. My wife was. I wouldnt worry they are very good at finding new residents and sending them offers. As with all forms of debt: it is easier to get more then less.

Taxes:
For the first year I recommend you go to a service, they are cheap and they tend to get it right. Plenty of little places like in the mall and in dicey neighborhoods. 

financial mistakes should I avoid?:
scams are a big one, they prey on immigrants, anytime someone says to you "I have a way for you to make money selling something or getting recruits" thank them for their time and move on. As for cars there are a  few sites online that show you the true cost of ownership. When you have a make model you like enter it in. Determine if you can afford it. Do not avoid mass transit. I know what it is like in SA trust me it isnt like that here.

Some good advice for immigrants:

Explore, network with other people from your home country, and keep your ears open for opportunities that you can do that the locals cant. Some examples of opportunities:

voice overs for adverts, translator services (this can pay a lot if you know something rare), working in exotic restaurants, and testing audio systems. |-|

W2 employees can deduct unreimbursed business expenses on Schedule A.

Make your own baby food. This saves massive amounts of money.
Cloth diapers, you will use thousands of diapers and if you get the reusable ones you will save buckets of money.  |-|

* Get a quote from as far as you can drive to. I drove an hour to buy my car since it was way cheaper down south then up north. 
* Use a google voice and spam email for these quotes because they will CALL and constiently email you. 
* Don't pick up their calls
* Ask for Out of door price and make them break it down for you. Car base price, taxes, processing fee, titles (in all quotes from USAA or consumer reports it will already include delivery charge, so dont get charged again)
* Once you get a quote from one dealership, say, i got a quote for xxx out the door. Can you beat that price. 
* Look at true car to see how much the car is selling for. 
* Dont buy extended warranty if you are buying new car
* They will probably charge you for floor mats. Try to not pay for them. 
* Dont tell them you have a trade in. dont even mention it until you got the deal done 

Good luck!  |-| 
|-| cnxe9sg || 10 || Does it have to be a "new" car? 

You say that you want the car payments "reasonable." What's reasonable to you?

My personal opinion, and what myself and my wife have done for the past 3 years, is to take what you would normally pay for a car payment ($250 to $300 per month) and put that in a second savings account. You are making payments to yourself. Do that until your car literally (not figuratively) dies. Take the money in cash form to the nearest used car lot and negotiate a deal on a cheap car. You can easily save $3000 between now and the end of the year. That won't buy you a new car, or even a very nice car, but it will buy you a car that will last for at least 2 years. At that point, you can buy a $6000 car (this is the step we're currently at). That $6000 car will last you at least 4 years, at which point you can buy yourself a $12,000 car. You can get very nice cars, at this point...

People worry too much about the car they drive, to the point they are willing to ruin their financial status. That just doesn't make sense to me. I'm driving a 2002 Chevy Cavalier, and my wife a 2003 PT Cruiser. Mock me if you must, but I don't have a car payment.... |-|

My personal opinion (without seeing the actual figures) is that if you have $10,000 worth of expenses to deduct, you are most likely far better off as a 1099 employee.

I was days away from evicting a long-term tenant who owed me 4 months worth of back-rent, and my other rental house was vacant.

This month the delinquent tenant paid all his back-rent and another 8 months of rent in advance to make it up to me, a new renter for the other house paid his rent in advance, and I sold my calves into a record-high market.

Now, all of a sudden, I have all my short-term debt and bills paid off and about $40k in the bank and the icing on the cake is that gasoline/fuel (one of my biggest expenses) is cheap as hell.  |-|

I had a company email with signature (job title), was required to use certain project tracking tools, required to show for company training, required at meetings, weekly code builds for QA, and daily status reports.

None of this (ihmo) makes you an employee, as opposed to a contractor.  If you were given the freedom of working when and where ever you wanted (baring meetings/training), then you were most likely a contractor.  You've stated you bought your own equipment for the job, which is a huge part of the contractor vs. employee differntiation.

They should be able to inform you about any government programs your mother would qualify for, such as food stamps, subsidized housing, etc. I haven't dealt with them personally, but often agencies like this can connect you with a social worker who can help you figure out what you qualify for and complete the applications. The ideal thing would be for her to get on disability, collect food stamps, and get into some kind of subsidized low income housing. The big obstacle is that she needs to cooperate with signing up for this stuff. I realize that you don't want to cut her off, but I think you should consider an ultimatum. Basically, tell her that she has to cooperate with signing up for this stuff, and give you access to all of her bank accounts, otherwise you are cutting off the money you give her. |-|

|-| cnxgq43 || 4 || wow, I had no idea.  I am in an opposite situation where I only drive about 5k miles a year on my car and so when my lease comes up in 18 months, the car is going to be worth a few thousand more than the buyout amount.

I didn't want to have to deal with selling it privately since it's unlikely anyone's going to show up with a check for $15k, but this is a great idea. |-| 
|-| cnxgsb6 || 5 || It's great to share that you can sell a lease at Carmax. This is something people frequently overlook. You probably could have saved your time with the detailing process, though. Carmax's offer is based on the actual condition of the car and not it's cleanliness. Unless of course it's so dirty that their reconditioning process wouldn't be able to clean it.


There are a number of factors taken into account when a Carmax Buyer (name of the position of the person that does appraisals) is appraising a car. Is it "Carmax quality?" In order to be sold at a Carmax dealership, it must be less than 10 years old, have less than 100k miles (for most cars), have 3 or fewer painted panels with no more than 2 next to each other, be free of frame damage and have no major accidents on record. They can tell if a panel has been painted or removed just by looking at it and touching it. Carmax will buy any car, even if it's not running, but only a portion of the vehicles they buy or are traded in make it onto the lot to be sold.


Once they determine if the car fits those standards, they will look at the same/similar car's book value (not Kelly Blue Book). This is mostly based on what that car is selling for at the auto auctions that Carmax attends. If they can buy the same car, same condition from an auto auction for $10,000, why would they offer you $12,000 for yours?


Overall condition, of course, is also taken into account. Minor dents and dings, scratches and all that will impact the value, but really only if it cannot be easily fixed during the reconditioning process. They drive it and make sure the engine runs well, transmission is shifting properly, there isn't a check engine light or other lights on, odometer properly scrolls over, etc.


If it is *not* Carmax quality, the main factor is the book value. They're just going to take that car and sell it at an auction to another dealership since they can't sell it on their lot. Literally every car that Carmax buys that isn't "Max Worthy" is sold on another dealer's lot.


Now, don't get me wrong. If your car is an absolute pig sty, you should definitely clean it up some. Just don't think you're going to get an offer of $1000 more because it's been waxed recently.


I worked there for a time, years ago, and only once did I see a car that was so dirty it actually impacted the offer. The entire back seat area was so completely full of garbage that you couldn't see through the rear window. It's been about 5 years since I worked there, so some things I've listed in this post might be slightly different, but for the most part, it's all ingrained in the overall mission of the company. |-|

|-| cnxj2qu || 3 || Dealership finance manager here. This seems like a pretty rare case.

Some basics on leasing first. There are 2 components in a lease payment: depreciation of the vehicle and a rental fee. When you negotiate a lease deal, it includes # of months and expected mileage. From there, a predetermined calculation is used for setting the residual value. Generally, it is anywhere from 40-70 of the MSRP. It is always based on MSRP regardless of the price you negotiate for this specific car. This residual is both the expected value of the vehicle when you would turn it in, and SHOULD be the amount that you can purchase the vehicle for if you take the lease to full term. Vehicles that typically hold their value better over the first 3 years (and Toyota would be high in that list) will have higher residual values, meaning you should be paying less depreciation throughout the lease.

The rental charge, or money/lease factor, is how the manufacturer or lease company makes money. This is usually some shockingly low number like .002 or something along those lines. Don't be fooled by this. Multiply that by 2,400 to get a rough estimate of the effective interest you're paying throughout the lease. So that .002 money factor is actually a ~4.8% interest rate.

Putting down extra money at the start of a lease allows you to save that portion of the interest during the lease. If it's available and fits in your budget, a 1-pay lease option could potentially get that effective interest near 0.3% or something comparably insignificant. 

As for ways to make leases equitable, that's tough. The biggest factor is the car you're leasing. Trucks and fuel inefficient SUVs will be the worst. They will see a much more stark drop off in value in the first year, meaning they are worth less than the straight line depreciation that you're paying each month. If it fits into your budget, adding more miles to your lease up front is the most cost effective. Going from 12k miles per year to 15k miles per year will have a cost of about 15-18 cents per mile. Paying over mileage fees can come in anywhere from 20-50 cents per mile. Typical depreciation is about 15 cents per mile, so coupled with whatever interest you're paying, it's basically purchasing those miles at cost. If you end up using those miles, you're covered. If not, you've built up equity in the vehicle.

Example: you get a 15k mileage lease for 3 years (45k total), but only drive 12k per year (36k total). Your vehicle will be worth much more than you'll be allowed to buy it our for. Granted you've paid for a portion of that lease-end equity, but it should still give you a return on that investment.

There are other little quirks to leasing that I'd be happy to get into if anybody is curious. Also, if budget is a major concern to people, cost of ownership is really the best way to approach any car deal. |-|

we got our house refinanced from an FHA 30 year fixed, to a conventional 15 year fixed at a 1% lower rate, which only costs us $120 more per month.

and i have re-established my 401k/457 contributions to put away $200/month, which tightens the belt a bit on our budgets. we are on schedule to have my income amount invested by my 35th and both of our's by my wife's 35th.

for 2015, we will be trying harder to stick to our budgets and work on creating goals to encourage reducing frivolous spending within budgets.

2014 was extremely productive because we paid our car down last year, but 2015 is shaping out to be even better. hopefully a year full of many steps forward and only a few slides backward. |-| 
|-| cnxjfmh || 4 || Newly Married, 1st job out of College. Banked an extra paycheck this month and started our emergency fund with $1,500. Not bad for a one income family and my job gross is 45k. :) |-|

|-| cnxjuu4 || 3 || I hear that it's best if you file on time, even if you can't pay all of what is due. Pay whatever you can afford to pay at the due date. Then you'll have a smaller amount left to pay via a payment plan. 

Based on the info you gave, with no other information, if you're single with no dependents, your income tax would be about $3945, your self-employment tax about $6005, and a penalty for underpayment of about $179. Total: **$10,129**.

That could be different if you have a little student loan interest you can deduct (save $15 for every $100 of interest you paid, up to $2500 in interest), or if you made a traditional IRA contribution. Obviously it's also valuable to scour for legitimate business-related expenses you can deduct, if you can find more than $3500.

Here's how I estimated:

Schedule C (business profit):  
$46,000 gross - $3500 business expenses = $42,500 profit

Schedule SE (self-employment tax):  
Sched C * 92.35% * 15.3% = **$6005**.

Form 1040 line 12: +$42,500  
Form 1040 line 27: –$3003 (deduct 1/2 SE tax)   
Form 1040 line 40: –$6200 (standard deduction)  
Form 1040 line 42: –$3950 (personal exemption)  
Form 1040 line 43: $29,347 (taxable income)  
Form 1040 line 44: **$3945** (from tax table, page 79)

Form 2210 (underpayment penalty):  
Line 4: $3945 + $6005 = $9950 (tax due)  
Line 5: $8955 (90% of tax due = required amount)  
Line 9: $8955 (presuming last year's tax values irrelevant)  
Line 15: 0.01995 * $8955 = **$179**

So the "effective" federal tax rate is 10,129/46,000 = 22%.

You should stop doing that. If you're being evicted anyway, stop paying the rent. If it's an illegal tenancy he probably can't come after you for missed rent. Do you have a lease?

Also, probably not the most elegant solution but you can also look into an involuntary psychiatric hold at your local mental health center/hospital.

|-| cnxlfgk || 4 || Very excited first-time poster here! Over the past two months, I've taken a lot of small steps to kick-start my savings. I have...

* Started officially budgeting. Holy moly. More groceries; less takeout.

* Begun using [Intellilist](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/grocery-list-intellilist-barcode/id425278338?mt=8) to compare grocery prices at local stores. [\[Screenshot\]](http://i.imgur.com/uIYl2Ll.png)

* Replaced my BankAmericard Rewards Card (1.25x points + 25% annual bonus) with a Sallie Mae Barclaycard (5% cash back on groceries/gas/Amazon), and a Citi Double Cash Card (2% cash back), which should increase my rewards by almost $200 a year! **BONUS**: Cashed out my BoA rewards and got $425 in Target and CVS cards!

* Switched my work IRA from a moderate ([FTMTX](http://quotes.morningstar.com/fund/ftmtx/f?t=ftmtx)) to a growth fund ([FTGTX](http://quotes.morningstar.com/fund/FTGTX/f?t=FTGTX))!

* Replaced my New Jersey E-Z Pass with a New York E-Z Pass to save $156 annually on tolls. **Useful tip:** E-Z Pass discounts vary depending on which State issues your tag. Make sure you're getting the best discounts on the roads you travel most. You are allowed to enroll in any State!

* Canceled my $7 monthly [DI.fm](http://www.di.fm) premium streaming radio account. :'(

* Signed up at [camelcamelcamel.com](http://www.camelcamelcamel.com) to track Amazon price trends on purchases I plan to make.

Next steps:

* Look into increasing or maxing out my personal IRA contribution

* Improve Intellilist grocery database, begin clipping coupons, and buy items where prices are the lowest

* Increase my car payment?

* ???? / PROFIT!!! |-|

|-| cnxlnjg || 3 || Around 6k. Dual income of a bit over 100k in nyc. That'll cover 3 months, but both jobs are incredibly stable. No money anywhere else as we're paying off student loans. 

Mid 20s |-| 
|-| cnxlp46 || 3 || A few things to focus on (from have 3 kids):

1.  Most important: line up good insurance and think of costs that go past just the birth.  After insurance, each kid ran us about $3,000.  But that wasn't the end of medical bills.  Our first child had a minor medical condition that was unforeseen.  A couple of procedures later and all was well, but the pre-insurance bill was about $14,000... after insurance, around $4,000.  The third kid, came down with RSV after about a month.  Hospitalized for a week; pre-insurance $8,000, after insurance $1,400.  

So yea, get insurance.  Check on the deductibles, coverage percentage, and most important... if there is a preferred provider list.  You can have all the insurance in the world but if your chosen hospital is not in-network, then you'll probably be on the hook for the entire cost.

2.  Buy very little clothing yourself, beforehand.  You will not know for sure on the size of the baby (ultra-sound measurements can be off a whole 2 lbs) and you'd hate to drop $100-300 on clothes that are not used.  Also, you as a parent will develop a preference for the type of clothing only after you learn from real-life experiences, such as: preferring dressing an infant in zip-up sleepers as opposed to button snaps (try snapping a sleeper on the changing table 2 am in the morning while sleep deprived).  

As mentioned with other posters... 2nd-hand clothing stores for children are great.  Why spend $15 for a pair of pants that the kid will grow out of after wearing it 3 times.  Buy it used for $4, and sell it back when you're done.

3.  Diapers.  Same as above with preferences (brands) and sizing out.  If anyone offers to buy you diapers, instantly ask for size 2 to 3.  You'll have to store them forever, but you'll fly through the newborn and 1's.

Count on changing 8-15 diapers per day.  Find a box of diapers, take the cost and divide by the number of diapers in the box.  Times the cost per diaper by 15 to get your diaper cost per day.  Keep in mind, cheaper diapers are cheap for a reason... if its thin and your kid pees through it, then you're changing clothes and sheets also.  (By the way, if you have a boy, then point and tuck the unit down before closing up the diaper to help limit pee blowing out the diaper).

Walmart has 'fair' quality wipes at a cheap price.

4.  If daycare, then... we paid $160 a week for an infant.  Look into state-assisted financial support for daycare if the both of you are college students.  The hidden balloon costs of daycare to watch for include: who provides the sheets, formula, and food.  Some provide the crib-sheets but not the bottles/formula, some vise-versa.  If you go formula, count on burning through a large container each week.  Kids usually stay on formula for about a year (maybe $100 a month for formula).

5.  Car seats.  We bought used ahead of time off of craigslist to save money.  They have expiration dates that note when the plastic will degrade until unsafe.  If you buy used, then you can find a matching set (2) for $30-40 easily.  A matching set is great even when you don't expect to use 2 (for emergency pickups of a sick child by grandparents, etc).

6.  Fancy diaper disposal trash cans.  Refill bags are expensive and all fancy cans fill up fast.  Skip it and get a regular trash can with a lid.  Get Walmart shopping bags to dump really nasty diapers in and tie up the handles, then drop the bag into the regular can.

7.  Handle your infant during the first 6 months as much as possible.  After 3 kids and doing things different each time, I can say that is the cheapest option.  Why?  Constant human interaction is a better stimulus for infant development.  Faster mental/physical development gets you out of diapers faster, out of baby food faster, etc.  It also keeps you out of physical and speech therapy that can run $50-70 per session.

|-| cnxlqtw || 3 || I'm saving up cash for a 20% down payment for a house + additional expenses and cash buffer in Nov/Dec 2016 so right now that cash acts as an emergency fund just in case.

File your taxes and claim her as a dependent. Boom, cashback from Uncle Sam right there. 

As of that point, you are a poor caretaker. 

Put her in a church with women her age. Explain your situation to them and ask them to help her go to church events. Who cares if god is real, this is free social shit for her, plus friends, and I guarantee its some good food for you. 

Work with every chuch and charity in your area. Get your food from food banks. 

Work with a social services rep to maximize your food stamps, housing aid, and anything else you can get. 
Put mom on social security and medicaid. Whatever you can get.

Based on the info you have given, that sounds like a good route. If you are not confident you can pay off both loans by the time the 18-month 0% period is up, you are going to get destroyed by CareCredit interest. 2.7% on the car is a pretty low rate. You would not be penalized much for taking the "safe" path of killing the CareCredit principal before it blows up on you. You will need to pay about $278 per month to get rid of it in 18 months. But, if you are very confident you can pay down all this debt before then, go for the car loan first.

Always have an emergency account. Paycheck-to-paycheck is a rotten way to live. Also am I missing something? You said 10k of debt but I only see $7800 here. Feel free to post your expenses and we can give you more of a plan. |-|

|-| cnxv4ch || 6 || Hold the phone. First off, why are you getting *all* your teeth pulled at 23 and why did the student clinic suggest saving some of them?

Second, you have 32 teeth- assuming normal anatomy and no prior extractions. What is the dentist charging you? A simple extraction should run between 150-200 as the advertised price. Surgical will be more. The fact that you are getting all your teeth removed is going to cost more because of the risk of complications, the intensity of the overall procedure, etc. When you said you tried to get a $7k loan, that leads me to believe this was the price you were quoted. So that's roughly $220 per tooth. That leads me to believe these will all be simple extractions with minimal follow up care. You should be able to get this down to like $100-150 per extraction, or less. Get all this info together and then shop around for dentists if you haven't already. Go to dentalplans.com and find a discount plan that looks good for your area and then call the dentists that it says are affiliated, confirm they participate and the prices from the site, and then give them your treatment plan from your current dentist.

I will throw one other suggestion out there. Consider going to another country to have this done. Eastern Europe is full of dentists and the materials are all the same. The quality of the work will vary from dentist to dentist but these are extractions, not restorative work. If you absolutely must have all your teeth taken out, you have eastern europe, costa rica, mexico (pricier), etc. I'm talking like $40-50 for a simple, $120ish for a surgical extraction at what would be a very "flashy" clinic. A more regular price would be half of that. You can come back to the states for any restorative work like implants, dentures, etc. Which I would do anyway, just because this will require long term follow up and I personally would not want to have my dentist thousands of miles away and in a foreign country. But it can be done. you likely won't be able to get a loan for any of this, but averaging $35/tooth, plus $1k in airfare, plus a hotel for a week and food you're looking at inside of $3k all said and done.

edit:

one final thought- if this relates to a medical condition that is affecting your teeth, you might be able to get this done through your health insurance, assuming you have it. |-|

|-| cnxxtyv || 9 || The video is interesting, but you have to bear in mind where the advice is coming from: Bill Ackman.  Bill Ackman founded and runs Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund.

So, it is no surprise that his advice is:

1. To invest like he does (in individual company stocks from companies you understand, that are value plays, etc.).
2. To invest using (active) fund managers who have good recent performance for five years or more.

Basically, he's advising that you should either compete against him in the market or pay him (or someone like him) to invest your money for you.  The problem with that is that it's bad advice.  Most people do not beat the market.  Most active fund managers, even the ones with good past performance, also do not beat the market after accounting for expenses.  Hedge funds are some of the most expensive actively managed funds you can buy too.

For what it's worth, I thought the initial part of the video up until the recommendations was pretty good.

I prefer [these videos on investing using the Bogleheads investment philosophy](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy).  The production is not as slick, but there also aren't annoying sound effects.

|-| cny09se || 3 || IRS employee here:

For your 2014 return, **file on time**, even if you can't pay in full on 4/15.

/u/wijwijwij has essentially prepared your 2014 return for you, and the bottom line appears to be ~$10,321.

Ordinarily, I would advise you to make the largest payment you can afford on or before 4/15/2015. This advice must be tempered with the recommendation to also make an accurate first quarter estimated tax payment for your 2015 liabilities.

Assuming you e-file your 2014 federal return, your first balance due notice will be issued in the third week of May. This notice will show any remaining unpaid tax, plus an assessment of Failure To Pay (FTP) penalty, plus interest. If you can full pay by the notice due date, you are done.

If you need a little more time to pay, you can request a short term extension, called a Full Payment agreement. With this plan, you can request up to 120 days to get it paid. During the 120 days, the balance due continues to accrue FTP and interest, but there is no requirement to make a fixed monthly payment, and there is no fee to request the agreement. You could make 1 or 100 payments, as long as it's paid in full by day 120.

If you need more than the 120 days, you can request a formal monthly payment plan, called an Installment Agreement (IA). There is a one-time set up fee of $120, and a required minimum monthly payment (the balance due on the first notice / 72).

If you know when you file you want the IA, you would include [Form 9465](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Form-9465,-Installment-Agreement-Request-2) with your electronic or paper return. You can also request a Direct Debit IA through your checking account on the 9465.

After you receive your first notice, you can request either payment plan at irs.gov [Online Payment Agreement](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Online-Payment-Agreement-Application). You can also make the request over the phone by calling 1-800-829-0922 M - F 7am - 7pm. When you speak with a representative, they will verify your identity, research your account, provide the payment options, and input the resolution you request. 

After you request either agreement type, whether online or over the phone, you will receive a confirmation letter with all terms and conditions within 2 to 3 weeks. The Service sends monthly reminder notices when you request an IA.

The FTP rate is generally 1/2 percent per month or part of a month, and is calculated on the unpaid tax. If a taxpayer files timely (and some other conditions), the FTP rate can be dropped to 1/4% for the lifetime of the agreement. Interest is currently 3% per year, compounded daily, and can be adjusted quarterly. Interest is charged on the unpaid tax and penalties.

Paying a federal balance isn't like a mortgage or car payment: every dollar pays the oldest tax liability first, then the penalties, then the interest. If a Taxpayer owes more than one assessment, the payment isn't split.

He tried to live an awesome lifestyle without graduating high school and working as unskilled labor making I would guess just above minimum wage.  
He f$$$ed up, and will now need to rejoin the real world and start cleaning up the mess he made. He has to work, a lot. He has to live like a pauper, for 2 to 5 years. He has to decide upon a path in life that leads to employment beyond minimum wage.

Tell him he already owes you money and while it's difficult, that this is a hell of a good kick in the ass and he needs to lie in the bed he made. 

You'll know he's ready for serious change when he rents the cheapest, tiniest, grossest apartment in the worst part of town, keeps working those 2-3 jobs steadily and with little complaint about his "incompetent coworkers". (Which I seriously doubt they are, I think he just wants to pawn his work on them and they aren't taking it, or else his coworkers are reacting to his own screwups which are taking time from their jobs, making them look incompetent) Also when he gets over himself and stops acting like he's some special snowflake that deserves the world handed to him for working.

|-| cny8cty || 46 || Hi, I'm an economist, but I've also been a high states poker player, professionally at one point for about 5 years.  
  
$27k is a trivial, meaningless sum to banks.  No one cares about this deposit until there is a pattern of it happening multiple times or in multiple banks.  I've made similar deposits dozens of times in cash.  No one batted an eye.
  
That said:  Your story is bullshit.  
  
&gt;To avoid all that and having to explain manufactured spending to them, I thought I'd wait until closing to deposit all the cash.
For the same reason, since a lot of my tenants (from another rental property) also pay in money orders, I started only cashing those instead of depositing. Meanwhile, I played a lot of poker and ran hot accumulating more hundred dollar bills I didn't want to deposit.  
  
So you purchase and own existing rental property...but

&gt;I'm not evading taxes and haven't done anything illegal nor do I intend to. WTF do I do here though? I can't leave the cash under my mattress and wait until maybe the house burns down or my dead broke landlord goes through my room again and maybe finds it.  
  
You live in an apartment with a "dead broke landlord" who will steal your cash?  
  
Anyway, whatever criminal thing took place to generate this windfall for you, no one is going to wonder about it if you just put it in the bank.  It's just an incredibly small amount of money in those terms.  
  
If you're actually asking how to launder money, make a new post "How do I launder money."  It's easy to explain and carry out and would probably save you a lot of stress.   |-| 
|-| cny8dzi || 3 || Are you evading the taxes on your rental profit? |-| 
|-| cny8gcs || 3 || Hey Reddit, how do you launder cash? Thanks. |-| 
|-| cny8h9o || -4 || I didn't read your whole story there but I get the point. (Getting fired etc is irrelevant.)

If it were me and this were a one-time thing I'd go to two random check cashing places every weekday for two weeks and convert $1000 into cashiers checks.

Once I've gotten that done I'd take a few cashiers checks every week to one of my bank branches and deposit them.

Banks will ask what these are for (this happens to me with freelance clients, and it irritates the fuck out me, because first, I do legit business with clients and two, the fuck? Do I look like a criminal? Jesus it's none of their business and it shouldn't matter.) regardless just say it's freelance work for websites or construction or whatnot, or that you're a small business and are depositing this stuff for payroll to your subcontractors or something.

Anyway, banks need management approval typically to deposit amounts of $4k or $5k at once (which gets more eyes looking at you.)

Also in my experience you're better off with either a big bank with a big bank branch (because they're professional) or a small credit union that has professional people working there.

**My experience regarding this kind of thing**- I had a client who wouldn't do direct deposit and would write checks, but they'd wait until they got a certain amount billed until they wrote checks out. All my local branches are with a big bank, but the bank branches are small and staffed with either really young or sketchy tellers (a girl teller might have her boyfriend hanging out in the lobby, for instance.) 

When those kind of tellers would look at the check, their eyes would get big and they'd look me over as if they're trying to figure out how someone like me would come in with a check that big (big to them), or even occasionally you could see the gears ticking on how they could try to rob me, dox me, or break into my account after hours or something.

Sounds paranoid, crazy, whatever but I've had enough of these experiences where you just know this kind of shit is happening behind the scenes.

Anyway getting back on topic of you:

This is all to say, if it were me there's no way I'm brining $27k into a bank, unless it's some big branch. If you bring it in cash you're gonna look hella suspicious, and even though this isn't illegal banks like to think they can make their own rules and you're gonna have eyes all over you if you do it like this.

**TLDR**: So again my advice: slowly turn the cash into cashiers checks via random check cashing places that don't have fees. Deposit slowly over time no more than $3.5k at a time and not so frequently. Try depositing at a bank's big branch. Come in dressed slightly professional. When asked how you're getting the money (which again is bullshit they think they have a right to ask) just say it's from freelance website work or something, and that this was for work over the last year that they're finally paying you for.

If you deposit $3.5k twice a week, that's $7k a week, you'll have everything in the bank a little over a month. Good luck. |-|

One piece of advice I will add as somebody who was in a very similar position. Don't be proud about money. Don't worry about appearing cheap or thrifty or poor. I know one of the big things for me was to tell people, "I'm trying to save money right now". It can be hard to admit to people, but communicating it makes it real. And for the most part, people are either in a similar situation, or have been through it before. |-|

This time next year, I don't want to have to worry about where the next meal is coming from. |-| 
|-| co92gc2 || 11 || Congratulations!!  I am in a similar boat -- down to 35% CC utilization from 90% 7 months ago....and we are also planning a reward vacation for 2016 (to Paris &amp; Venice through my university).  

Our emergency fund bailed us out in January when our washing machine and one of the cars died, and I still paid cash for tuition a week later.  Last year, a month like that would have resulted in us turning to credit cards.

The best part of all of this is watching my daughter's awareness of money grow.  She watches me use YNAB and asks questions about budgeting all the time now.  She calculated how much we would save by visiting her favorite restaurant once a month rather than once a week so that we can save for this European trip.

|-| co919c1 || 8 || Ahhh...this definitely speaks to me...  

I've been terrified to log into my student loan account; I have $43k hitting repayment this month and next month. So I have to start paying that, car payment ($300/month), credit card ($1500 on it), rent ($830), etc... seeing all the numbers really freaks me out.  

I really need to buckle down and set myself on a budget. I've tried using Mint, but it just doesn't work for me. There was a spreadsheet on here recently, so I think I'm going to try that and see if it helps me stay on budget. It just seems like my money disappears as soon as I get it. It's rough and it's starting to really affect me. I feel depressed and don't want to do anything. But I realize if I don't do anything about my situation, it won't ever get better.  |-| 
|-| co93q9e || 8 || Congrats on the progress! Don't stop now!
Just curious, why do you have 27% utilization on your credit cards but $12,000 in a bank account/ emergency fund? Surely the interest on the credit cards is much higher than any return you are getting from your savings account. My advice is to pay off the credit cards today and then resume building your emergency fund. If for some reason something came up before you fully refunded your emergency fund, you could use your credit cards as a last resort. At least you wouldn't be paying cc interest between now and doom. IMHO  |-| 
|-| co946ys || 6 || I needed to read this. I started using YNAB a month ago, and know things will start falling into place, but just got hit with with a $416 car repair and a $350 electric bill, that caused me to break down in tears. I hope I am where you are a year from now! Thank you for the healthy dose of hope! :) |-| 
|-| co95qui || 8 || Not trying to take anything away from your accomplishment, which is amazing. How is one supposed to get back afloat if they have a shitty paying job that only covers their basic life expenses and can't even pay anything towards their current debt or past due bills?  |-| 
|-| co9hyqc || 6 || The best lesson my mother taught me, as I got my first job, was to put a little bit in the bank every week, even if it's just $1. So I started with $1 and than $5 and than $20. I don't make that great of a salary but now I put away $125 every week, which is roughly 20% of what I make. The trick is to make auto withdrawals from your checking to your savings, after awhile it becomes a "bill", but one you're paying to yourself - once you stop missing that money increase the amount you save. 

While this may seem only loosely related the truth is keeping on top of this every week really helped me to grow up taking control of my money and not letting it control me. 

Between bank accounts, investments and credit cards I have about a dozen accounts. I make sure to check EVERY SINGLE ACCOUNT at least once every other day, which keeps me aware of the money I'm spending. 

I honestly don't make the greatest money and work 12-14hr days because of it but just being on top of my money allows me to go on vacation twice a year and keep from ever paying interest. 

You're in a unique position and are taking the right steps to take control of your money and your life, good on you! |-|

I make $10.50/hr, max of 25 hrs/week. I have a second job that really only calls me on holidays, where I make $9.25/hr, and will probably get a raise to $9.40 in March. My estimated annual income will be ~$13-14k. So a little over $1k/month. 

I have $17k remaining in student loans, which I've been paying faithfully on time for 3 years, regardless of my financial situation, at $250/month. I have $5k remaining in a loan I took from the bank to buy a car, which I've been paying for 6 months at $168/month. I pay $29/month for health and dental insurance, and $90/month for gas (a lot of driving between work duties and commuting). I'm picking up insurance on my car in March, which will be about $70/month. I have to feed myself and clothe myself somehow. I have medication to pay for, and occasional incidental costs like hygiene items, etc. 

By the time all is said and done, I'm lucky if I can set aside $5. Today, I have $8.88 in my bank account and $300 in savings. I got sick last month and it wiped out a lot of what I did have saved after a $250 office visit and $300 in medication. Two weeks later I had to replace the battery in my car for $110. 

I feel like I've failed as a human being because I can't even support myself, much less save any money. It's not like I make any frivolous purchases, and I've really worked on my spending habits. I actually paid off a $3000 credit card debt that I had hanging over my head for years in April 2014. My credit score is above 700. But I feel like I can't get ahead, financially. 

You've done a good job, and you deserve to feel good about what you've done.  |-|

|-| co99hwl || 4 || I'm in debt and I'm not working right now. I don't know when I will be working again, and I'm freaking out because all my problems somehow stem from money. I'm always depressed (granted cause I'm bipolar) but the money thing just makes it so much worse to bear. I constantly feel like I'd rather die because I don't think I'll ever be able to climb out from this debt hole. 

I owe my boyfriend, his mom, and companies and hospitals money. I'm overdrawn in the bank every month. My dad is helping me pay for stuff right now and it makes me sick that I can never pay him back. I have people that want money from me now, like today, and I have nothing to give.

Then next month I'll pay them and fall behind on other stuff because I paid off some stuff leaving no money for the other stuff. It's a cycle and it always stays the same no matter what I do. I don't know what to do anymore but I'm very close to giving up. I'm 28 and this hasn't ever gotten any easier. |-| 
|-| co8z103 || 6 || Solid this is my goal! I just landed a job with a good salary and I just budgeted everything into mint. To my surprise, with my bills and salary, I was still able to budget ridiculous stuff in like an extra $400 on clothes a month, and $450 on eating out, while still having about 1k left to save. Mint is freaking great!

Your pension would probably be included in that number unless there's some reason to believe you might not be getting that money.

How much do you have saved in various retirement accounts right now?
 |-| 
|-| co8xzlo || 14 || Retirement is a big topic, but most of the conventional wisdom you see is very over simplified. Your income doesn't matter, it's how much you spend that matters. If you spent $10k a year, you wouldn't need very much to retire even if you made $10 million a year. 

Think about it. If you had $100k saved you'd meet this rule, but if you suddenly got a raise to $300k a year you wouldn't say "Dang, now I'm not even close to retiring". |-| 
|-| co8tfqh || 9 || I like that metric, but it is very general (as with any rule of thumb). I would certainly include pension income as money already saved. If your pension income is like a bucket with a principal, then subtract that out from your benchmark goal. If it's a defined benefit pension, with a monthly stipend, do your best to predict the monthly payout and subtract that from your expected monthly income requirements. Then you have to go back and figure out the principal needed to make up the difference.

Anywho, that came from [this study](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/retirement/8X-retirement-savings) and note they say:
&gt;This rule of thumb is intended to be only a starting point in determining the actual savings needs for any individual. We realize there is a wide variation of savings needs, based on many factors such as... potential pension income... |-| 
|-| co8v5ou || 8 || I can't comment intelligently on the state of pensions in Canada, but here in the States, some public employee pension agreements aren't worth the paper they are printed on.  It's a slow-motion train wreck and we're all just sort of watching it unfold before our very eyes.  

I'd suggest looking at your pension system, specifically its unfunded liabilities, and see if it passes the smell test.  The more secure you feel about the state of the pension fund, the less you need to save outside of it as backup.

I think an easier rule of thumb is: save 15% of your paycheck.  If your pension is taking 5%, then save another 10%.

You'll never be sorry because you "saved too much." |-| 
|-| co8v7ge || 4 || I've learned to ignore most of the benchmarks. They are useful for a few people that match exactly the profile the creators were exploring, but the real world tends to be so much messier.

Like you, I have a pension plan that will contribute towards my retirement. It really messes up a lot of the "normal" advice you get.

Here's how I handle it...

Figure out how much you want to spend per year in retirement (and, no, that's not an easy question to answer). Let's say it's $60K.

If your pension will provide you $30K per year, then you need investments that will throw off another $30K per year. If you use the 4% annual safe withdrawal rate, then you'd need about $750K in investments to get that other $30K/year. There's also Social Security out there -- but lots of people don't really want to count on it being around in it's current form (especially younger folks like you). It's up to you if you want to consider the role of Social Security in your retirement plans. Also remember that inflation works against you. $60K today is not going to be $60K in 2035 dollars. Finally, you need to realize that an early retirement will likely need a lower withdrawal rate to make that money last, so factor that in.

Most importantly, though, the greatest impact you can have on your financial well-being in retirement is to save as much as possible as **early** as possible so that the returns can compound. Sock away as much as possible in your 20's and early 30's.

edit: lost a word |-| 
|-| co8tcma || -4 || Pension would be included in that.  

If you're in your 20's, a general rule to follow is to save 6% of your income for retirement.  If you are saving via a pension, you don't need to save that much on your own.  If your pension contribution ended up being 5%, then you'd save 1% on your own.   |-| 
|-| co8vqxl || -3 || You should be saving 10% per year, if you start working at 18 you should be at 1 full year by 28. |-|

|-| co90tnf || 14 || New SF homeowner here.

I think it comes down to your time horizon. If you intend to stay for a long time you'll do OK if you purchase. If you are only going to stay five years then rent.

The SF market on average has appreciated about 6% a year. If you put a small down payment (say $150,000) and the home appreciates 6% you've made $60,000 on $150,000. It can also go the other way. But if you stay long term the numbers will even out. Short term it's anyone's ballgame.

Also just because the interest rates increase does not mean you will pay more. It may suppress the market near-term. 

Also if you are looking for a million dollar home remember bidding wars can easily bring it to 1.2 or 1.3 mil. So you're really in the market for an $800,000 home, and I don't think you'll find one with 1800-2000 sq. foot. I'm not a big fan of realtors, but in this market I'd suggest finding one so that they can navigate you through these points.

Best of luck. My experience last year of finding a home in SF was akin to having my toenails pulled out. I would never do it again or recommend that anyone do it at all, unless you have the kind of money that you don't have to sweat the small stuff.

|-| co92wjx || 7 || I'm going to take a stab at this from a culture perspective. I came from a part of the world where 3 generations living together is fairly common. And as a result, everyone involved kind of accept the potential that this will happen, and can deal. 

I am in a mixed race relationship now, and my spouse is not from that culture. I can tell you with an absolute certainty that if I move my parents in with us, there would be issues to the point that our marriage can end. Heck, I've seen it happen to friends. The person not immersed in the idea from a young age might agree to it and thinks everything will be fine, but they have no idea what they've gotten themselves into. 

I'm going to take a risk at generalizing on Reddit, and say that the only way this situation has a chance of working is if you both are from similar cultures and expected this would happen growing up. It's going to difficult regardless, but at least then you'll have a chance.

Make sure that net calculation has taken into account the possibility that you will be subject to AMT (alternative minimum tax) after after the home purchase.   State taxes, including property taxes, cannot be deducted for purposes of calculating AMT.  In places like the Bay Area, where state income taxes are high and property taxes are high for new homebuyers, AMT sometimes catches new homebuyers around your income level by surprise. |-|

OP's household income is 250K which I assume is split somewhat evenly between husband and wife.

This is kind of a big question mark to me. How are they helping? Why are you paying for their housing? Surely if all they want to provide is free babysitting, getting a nanny or paying for daycare would still be cheaper. Unless there's more to the story, to me it sounds to me like you're subsidizing their desire to spend a lot of time with their grandchild.

|-| co9c0cm || 7 || There are a few things you can do

1.) you can file a lien against the property owner where the work was actually done.

you probably can't get them to pay just based on a lien, but they might want the lien removed eventually.

more importantly, if there is lien against the property, when they do go to sell it (or re-finance the property), they will have to settle the lien before the sale can go through.

in my life, i did this (to a boss that didn't pay me), it took about 10 years, but eventually when the property owner was buying a new house, his lender required that he settle his old liens.  So, not only did he track me down, but came to me, he paid in full, and he paid cash.  Once he did that i signed the "release of lien" document that he needed signed.

so, getting a lien might not get you cash right away, but if none of the other quicker methods work, you can get a lien against the property, OR ...

2.) just get a judgement (from small claims court) against the individual who hired you.

If he has skipped town, just file it in your local small claims court, he probably won't even show up, so as long as you show up, you will win the judgment by default.

in most states you can't do much with only a judgement (in terms of collecting) but one day he'll go to buy something big, or need to clear up the liens against him for some reason, and he'll need to clear it up, and by "clear it up" i mean he'll have to pay you to have it removed.

3.) ALSO.... one other trick i used (i've dealt with shady bosses more than once).  IF its possible, get him to write you a check (for any amount) that will bounce.

I did this when i had a boss, and i sensed (after a few weeks of missed checks) that he was NEVER going to pay (besides, there were former employees, from previous months, coming by the job site who had been burned, and who were looking for him and their money - and they warned me that he was a scammer who didn't pay).

So, knowing this, I acted like everything was fine.  Although, i did ask my boss, (who I knew was gonna eventually rip me off) that i needed some checks written to me, to show that i had SOME income coming in, so that I could apply for some rent assistance thing that the city of NY welfare office was offering.

I acted like he was doing me a favor, and in doing so I would be able to wait longer for my delayed-payments (which was something he was glad to hear).  He said, OK, and wrote me three checks for $600 each.  he told me not to cash them, and he specifically told me that they were being written from an account that was closed.

I was like "OK, thats fine, I won't cash them, I just need to make copies of them to show the welfare people so that I can get the rental assistance" (I was behind in my rent at this point in my life).

In reality, I had no intention of applying for welfare or rent-assistance, but I did hold on to these 3 checks, and I waited until it turned out that he was actually not going to pay me at all.  he even stopped taking my calls, and he owned me about 5-6 weeks pay.

it was THEN that I deposited all three checks, knowing full well that they would bounce.  they did bounce, and then, with the bounced checks in hand, i went to the NYPD.  Its a crime to write a check that bounces, and one that they will arrest you for.  It goes beyond basic non-payment of wages issues, and becomes a felony.  At the police station, I acted like they were just regular checks written to me for services rendered, that bounced.  The NYPD station sent me upstairs to a detective, and they created a case.  About a month later, when he was pulled over for an unrelated driving violation, there was a warrant out for him (as a result of the case i filed), and he was immediately arrested.  The DA in NYC made a deal with him, they would not put him in jail if he paid me.  he agreed to the deal, and I was paid, in full within a week.

So.... if there is anyway to get a check (for any amount) from your boss that will bounce, I would strongly recommend doing that as well.

Hope one of these methods helps, and best of luck in getting your hard-earned money. |-|

Do not include a copy of your original return with the amended return. Do not include a *revised* version of a 1040 with the amended return.

Be sure you input **your current address**, check the appropriate tax year, filing status, and health care coverage on the return.

Page 1, Column A is where you input the figures on the original return (see the statement about IRS corrections above).

Page 1, Column C is the finished product after the corrections.

Page 1, Column B is where you show the math. Negative figures are in (parentheses). 

Page 2, Part III is your written explanation of the changes. Keep this simple: "Claiming the PMI deduction on Schedule A". Attach the revised Schedule A, and any forms or schedules that *change* as a result of claiming the deduction. The 1098 is not required.

You must sign and date the amended return.

You can mail the return, or bring it in to your local [Taxpayer Assistance Center](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Contact-Your-Local-IRS-Office-1). Make note of the mailing or drop-off date in your calendar.

After you mail the return, you should allow a minimum of 16 weeks for processing. Assuming the amended returns shows a refund, you should expect to receive the refund check and a notice explaining the change after that time.

Four weeks after the return is mailed, you can track the progress here: (http://www.irs.gov/Filing/Individuals/Amended-Returns-(Form-1040-X)/Wheres-My-Amended-Return-1)

If you do not receive the refunds or notices after 16 weeks, you can call customer service at 1-800-829-1040 M - F 7am - 7pm, and let the representative know you are checking on Form 1040X for 2014 and you have already checked the automated system.

Student loans in particular are very difficult to discharge, they even stick with you through bankruptcy in most situations, and the default will never disappear unless a court clears it in bankruptcy.  If your friend comes back in 40 years both of her lenders would technically have a right to garnish any funds or wages, plus fees and interest.  I'm not an attorney or expert but this is all just from a general working knowledge of loans and debt.

My recommendation is for your friend to work with her lenders.  If she has no income student loan companies will usually defer her loans.  And $5k in cc debt isn't an unmanageable amount of debt, if she is able to find employment then it would not be an insurmountable debt.

Bottom line is that I don't think she should be running away from her problems.  She's an adult and needs to figure out a solution that won't haunt her through her adult life.   |-| 
|-| co95fpd || 22 || Trying to run away because of $15,000 in debt?  Sounds like a terrible idea.  Just pay it.

Sounds like she isn't trying hard enough if she can't find a job with a degree for over a year.  Make an effort... |-| 
|-| co95bvj || 4 || I don't think Reddit is the place to ask this.  A lot of these are legal questions that attorney should answer.  And there is no way she left no trace of herself in the U.S. just because she isn't working here and has no bank account.  From your post she is a U.S. citizen.  Plus, the IRS always has ways to find you.  I work in trusts and estates and we had a decedent (a US citizen) move to Italy funnily enough and the IRS audited him because he didn't file his yearly returns and he was given a nice big fat bill to pay.  You can't truly disappear.  |-| 
|-| co96l7i || 5 || The bailing to Italy is a legal question but I think she does not need to do that as I think she could fix the problem here allot faster. The one thing she cannot do is bury your head in the sand.

First if her mother is very ill and receiving medicare and or medicaid there are some states that offer stipends to care for them at home versus a putting them in a nursing home. I do not know anything about it or which states do it but she should check with hospice company or the states agency for elder care/medicare.

On the student loans she needs to call them and tell them what happened and see if she can get a forbearance agreement while her mother is ill and she is taking care of her. She may still be accruing interest but better than going to collections. The people at the Student loans company can explain her options.

I did not know until today that credit card companies offer [forbearance agreements](http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-forbearance-programs.php) but they do. She is going to have to stop using the card until she is making payments again and makes payments but credit card companies are much more willing to work with you than collection agencies are. 

The trick is to be proactive and she will likely need proof of the mothers illness and she is full time caretaker. So many people want to run and hide from a problem (it is why the human eye can see more shades of green than any other color) but in this case attacking it could be better.

Good Luck with this. |-| 
|-| co98kae || 3 || All of these things people are saying are correct. You can fix $15k in a few years of hard work.

One thing no one has said, Italy doesn't extradite to the US, so that's in her favor. It's really dumb to "live the rest of your life on the run" when the US is a pretty good place to be. She could travel to Singapore in 15 years (random example) and have to live with the fear of being turned away at the border. |-| 
|-| co98rka || 3 || Unless she's filing for bankruptcy, all that CC debt will still be there, when ever she comes back.  |-|

That said, his debts must be paid with his estate and benefits before any additional distributions can be made to you/family/whatever.

|-| co930ky || 5 || Never pay a dead person's debts.

My friend's mom died awhile back, she had a number of credit card debts, plus racked up a ton of end of life hospital bills - no insurance. and no real assets either.

The credit card people weren't too bad, but he hospital collections agency were relentless. They kept telling him he should pay the bills so his mom's honor is restored, that sending a woman to her grave with a bad reputation is awful, etc. They were really mean.

He didn't give them a cent, but I can see that tactic working on some people.

|-| co8tqr9 || 7 || You might consider option 3.  Ask the lender to quote you a rate for a zero fee refinance.  I've done it twice in the last 5 years and have settled in at 3.75, all at no cost to me.  

In this volatile rate environment I think it's the only way to go.

 |-| 
|-| co8sn9a || 3 || How long do you plan to own the house?  

It will take a long time for you to make back the fees in interest savings, so it does not seem worth it to me, especially when you account for the  end date being extended.  The rule of thumb I use is it has to be at least a 1% drop and you have to plan on staying long enough to make the fees worth it. |-| 
|-| co9ph54 || 4 || While I agree with /u/malama61 that YNAB is really helpful with making budgets, I personally found it cumbersome to set up and resorted to used a simple Google spreadsheet, paired with [Mint](mint.com) to maintain my expenses. A budget is meant to be a flexible thing. When I made my first budget, I had to add and remove things for a few months before I had something that worked for me. Things will come up, because it's hard to foresee things in the future when you're worried about immediate expenses.

Here are my steps for making a budget:

* List your expenses, and try to make a realistic estimate for how much you spend. It's better to overestimate than to underestimate.
* Think about less-regular expenses, like a doctor/dentist/mechanic visit, and try to set aside an amount to deposit into a savings account for it.
* Set aside any amount to deposit into a savings account, or anywhere that's difficult to get to. The more, the better. Pretend like that amount was never there, and it'll help you control your spending.
* If something unexpected comes up, don't fret. Just add it to your budget for next week or month. It's an evolving document.

My tools (fancy, huh?) for PF are my Mint account, a notebook, and a Google spreadsheet. I took about 15-20 minutes to add my accounts to my profile, and it's easy to look back at my transactions in case I forgot to make a note earlier. 

Credit is intimidating for someone who is not familiar with it, but it's relatively straightforward. A credit card works by a credit card company giving you a line of credit. It works as though they are giving you a $x loan that you pay back every month. If you don't pay it off completely, they charge you a little based on how much of it you used, called interest. If you pay off the entire balance on the card before the bill is due, you only need to pay the amount you spent, and not a dime more. My procedure for using a credit card is:
* Use the card for everyday purchases, but use cash for things I don't typically spend on
* Set up automatic bill-pay on credit card so it will automatically draw from my checking account and pay it *in full*.

Given enough time, your credit score will go up. You don't need to worry about your score unless you're taking out a large loan, which should be limited to a mortgage or car loan. I believe this subreddit dislikes car loans in general.

Anyway, this got longer than I was expecting it to be. I hope this helps. |-|

So^nobody^knows..... |-| 
|-| co9k1c3 || 13 || IRS employee here:

&gt; the IRS can't possibly check each applicant to see if they had coverage?

Yes. Yes we can.

Thank you for reading. |-| 
|-| co9etmg || 4 || You get audited and they ask for proof. Boom.  |-| 
|-| co9eycz || 4 || Before I leave an answer to your question, I'd like to give you background information. I am currently involved in a volunteer tax preparation program where I work as a return preparer. I went through an online training program provided by the IRS and attended a 2 hour info session from an IRS agent regarded the Affordable Care Act. However, I am NOT officially licensed or anything like that. I am simply a volunteer tax return preparer.

With that disclaimer out of the way, I can tell you that Publication 5187 answers many questions regarding the ACA (http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5187.pdf)

In regards to your questions, if you have minimum essential coverage for the entire year you simply check the box on your Form 1040, as explained at the top of page 6 in Pub. 5187. No further forms are required, so to answer your question, it is possible to just say that you had coverage. However, I do not encourage falsifying information on your tax return. Another way to look at this situation is that the Shared Responsibility Payment (SRP) is the greater of 1% of your household income (which based on your info would be approximately $120) or a flat rate of $95 per adult, $47.50 for a child under 18, and is capped at $285. If you are single and have no dependents, your payment would be $95. Obviously I have no doubts that you want to get the most out of a potential refund as possible. However, the cost of penalties and interest, should there be problems, far outweighs the potential SRP payment for this year. I won't advise what you should do, but that should outline your options.  |-| 
|-| co9j2h5 || -3 || Your local death panel representative will require proof when they do your annual health assessment in June. |-| 
|-| co9awjz || 6 || Get her a "secured" card.  It's used like a typical credit card.  She just can't go hog wild.  Load enough to cover an emergency.  Do a little research as some tend to have a fee associated. |-| 
|-| co9b0n8 || 3 || From a bystanders perspective I'd hate to see both of you end up hurt and angry if she abuses the privilege. If the goal is primarily to build credit, I'd add her right now and NOT give her the card. Remember that you need her social security number tied with the card so it gets reported to the Credit Bureaus. 

Another step that comes to mind is setting up either a secured credit card and / or an emergency fund. If you can get the resources together and help her to save maybe $1-2k I'm sure that would be piece of mind for both of you. Having a secured card makes it feel more like a credit card which is what she wants, but a bank account may be more flexible. Note that I don't suggest you gift the money to her, rather help her come up with the money or you can provide some seed funding and then take out your share as she contributes. It's your call there but just an idea. |-| 
|-| co9kob4 || 25 || Yes, in the same sense that buying a Tesla might be cheaper than renting a helicopter to go everywhere you want to travel. That is, $25-30k is hardly a benchmark number for how to efficiently get from place to place. |-| 
|-| co9jrlu || 8 || This is a great time to audit all your car-related expenses.  What are you currently paying for insurance, gas, and (a reasonable estimation for) maintenance?  

How much would it cost to Uber 10-25 miles every day, keeping in mind that you would be subject to time and cost variations?

How does that compare to buying a $10k used car from craigslist (or other sources)?  

What's your backup plan if Uber goes under, or they have to close due to lawsuits or a change in city policy?

 |-| 
|-| co9jven || 7 || Cost of taking Uber everywhere:
10 commutes to work / week
6 commutes for running errands, fun / week
= 16 commutes / week

Avg cost of Uber ~$15 / commute

= $240 / week
  = $12,500 / year

That is very expensive.  Buying a $25k car is way cheaper since it will last 10 years.  Buying a $15k is cheaper still. |-|

|-| co97kmf || 6 || You can deduct business use of things like internet. The others are mostly questionable at best. |-| 
|-| co988rm || 5 || Tax Office junior preparer here, I asked my manager with 15 years experience, she said that less than 50% of your internet is likely used for business purposes, and as a lot of those things are also for personal use, its on the dark side of tax accounting, itemizing won't get you a larger return, and you'd be liable to be audited.
edit: Of course the only way to know for sure is to sit down and talk to an accountant.  Local non-brand-name offices only charge a bit over $100 for a regular old return. |-| 
|-| co988od || 3 || &gt;Are any of the above items that you (Video Game Industry Professionals that are W2) deduct?

See:

* http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc514.html
* http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040sca.pdf (page 21, Unreimbursed Business Expences).

Basically, the expenses must be work-related. So internet service/computer/games/joysticks are probably not really applicable, unless you're buying these things for work. Maybe you could argue some portion of your game purchases are for research; I don't know, as I'm not well versed here. But 100% of joysticks/peripherals seems rather egregious (unless you were a hardware designer, etc.)

&gt;Many of them write off a portion of their rent, but going through the tax code, it really seems like this isn't allowed since I have an office at my place of work.

See: http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc509.html

If you have an office room solely for the purposes of your work, then you can deduct that portion of your rent for business expenses.

I'll say that most of these are very questionable.

It should also be noted that these are itemized deductions, so if you don't have enough itemized deductions over the standard deduction, none of these deductions apply. |-| 
|-| co8uv8a || 6 || Think of it this way - if you expect a real return of 6% per year on your money, you are sacrificing a full 25% of the gains on your money

|-| co8s6rr || 12 || &gt; When is an actively managed investment account worth it?

When you've decided that you have too much money and it's important to you to give some of it away to a financial manager, who definitely will not outperform the market (by definition, anyone who can outperform the market reliably will be a multi-billionaire in a few years) but who will be happy to take 1.5% of your assets regardless of performance.

Although, you can accomplish the same thing with a passively-managed investment and just writing a check to a random investment manager.  In this case you can write it to PNC.  The more you know!
 |-| 
|-| co8s2ij || 9 || &gt;When is an actively managed investment account worth it?

Pretty much never.

&gt;I'm wondering if its worth it to invest with PNC in an actively managed portfolio which would take about 1.5% of my assets annually? I've been investing on my own in smaller sums and I wanted to know at around 100k, if its worth it to pay the 1.5% a year??

1.5% is a horrendously high fee.  See [this page](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost) for the effect of a 1.5% fee on your investment returns over long periods of time.

You generally shouldn't pay people to do what you can do yourself for free.  Maintaining a simple [three-fund portfolio](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/3_fund_portfolio) is about as inexpensive as it gets, and takes as little time as you want it to. |-| 
|-| co8wv0u || 3 || Never. Index funds all the way. |-| 
|-| co8scvm || 3 || If you enjoy giving half of your returns to someone else, you should start today.

If you aren't sure what to invest in, just buy some different funds.  Given your age, just plop it all into an S&amp;P Index fund if nothing else, or into a Target Date fund.  

The only time I've seen actively managed portfolios work is with very high net worth individuals (e.g. $10 million in investments) who are looking for very specific characteristics on fixed income or alternative investments. |-| 
|-| co9g1n3 || 9 || Amending your return is very easy.  Not putting down kncome that you forgot pr didn't know was taxable is not a huge deal.  What is a huge deal is knowing you have taxable income and seeking to hide it.

|-| co9k0e5 || 6 || IRS employee here:

&gt; Should I familiarize myself with a prison jumpsuit now or....?

Due to recent budget constraints, you will not be issued a jumpsuit. Your orange boxers are being prepared as we speak.

&gt; Should I absolutely amend?

Assuming the unreported income results in an increase in taxable income and tax, you will amend the previously filed and processed original return on [Form 1040X](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Form-1040X,-Amended-U.S.-Individual-Income-Tax-Return).

If you used a tax software to prepare your original return, they same software *may* be able to prepare the amended return. Don't be surprised if there is a fee for the service.

I assume the original (but incorrect) return was processed, and the Service has not made any changes to what you filed (you would received a notice if we did.)

Do not include a copy of your original return with the amended return. Do not include a *revised* version of a 1040 with the amended return.

Be sure you input your current address. Check the appropriate tax year, filing status, and health insurance coverage box.

Page 1, Column A is where you input the figures on the original return (see the statement about IRS corrections above).

Page 1, Column C is the finished product after the corrections.

Page 1, Column B is where you show the math. Negative figures are in (parentheses). 

Page 2, Part III is your written explanation of the changes. Keep this simple: "Adding interest income". Attach any supporting forms or schedules that *change* as a result of your increased income.

You must sign and date the amended return.

After you mail the return, you should allow a minimum of 16 weeks for processing.

Assuming you owe a balance due, include full payment of the tax increase when you file the return. If you are mailing a check or money order, make it payable to **United States Treasury**. The payment should have your name, address and daytime phone number. Please note **2014 - Form 1040X - XXX-YY-ZZZZ (your ssn)** on the check. You can also make the payment electronically [here](http://www.irs.gov/Payments). If you pay the balance on or before 4/15/2015, there will be no interest or penalties charged.

Four weeks after the return is mailed, you can track the progress here: (http://www.irs.gov/Filing/Individuals/Amended-Returns-(Form-1040-X)/Wheres-My-Amended-Return-1)

If you do not receive a notice after 16 weeks, you can call customer service at 1-800-829-1040 M - F 7am - 7pm, and let the representative know you are checking on a Form 1040X and you have already checked the automated system.

Ended up telling the new company about my situation, as they really wanted me to start a week before the bonus would be paid out. No hesitation on their part to offer me a signing bonus equivalent to what I would've been paid. 

I'm glad you got your situation sorted out, but in the future, do not be afraid to explain to a new company if you are in this position again. Most bigger companies will bend a bit if they really want you, and a $4k signing bonus is a drop in the bucket. |-|

|-| cog3wyi || 711 || Use that art degree and apply for graphic design jobs. Do you have any web skills what-so-ever? 

I'm 25, female, graduated from a private college with a bachelors in graphic design and $100k of student loan debt. I was lucky enough to get a job immediately out of college, but it only paid $30k/yr. I left after a year and now make $41k as an interactive designer/web dev, with the earning potential of $75k/yr+ based on co-workers and annual raises.


While my degree absolutely helped me obtain both the jobs I've had in this field, what matters the most is your SKILL. Employers ultimately want to see what you can do; if you're the greatest designer in the world, they're not going to care much about your education. 


Do you have a portfolio website? If not, set one up immediately (and not one of those free templated ones - invest in yourself and hire someone to build one. Message me if you want help).   



Graphic design is an excellent field with a lot of work, but you're extremely valuable if you have web design/coding experience, as this is the way the industry is going. I suggest you take some time to teach yourself these skills to make yourself desirable to employers.



Your degree might seem useless, but any degree is better than no degree. Just because it's not specialized in graphic design or web development does not make you ineligible for those type of jobs. It's worth it to apply to everything art related - you'd be surprised at the responses you get and the willingness employers will have on training you if you're GOOD at what you do. 



Stop looking for warehouse jobs and use the skills you paid $130k for.    |-| 
|-| cog1v3g || 81 || Income-based repayment? |-| 
|-| cog3os8 || 64 || &gt;there just isn't anything that pays more 35k in my area for someone my age with no experience besides warehouse.

You may have to start looking outside your area.  I dug myself into a hole with student loans with nothing to show for it, and had to find a way out.  I ended up getting a job as a rig hand, and boosted my income from around $20k/year to $65k + bonuses.  The drawback was I had to spend every other week away from my family, work 12-hour days, 7 days in a row.  Eventually I saved enough money to go back to school and get a few certifications that improved my income so that I didn't have to kill myself working on a rig.

You've got some hard times ahead.  It may not mean joining the military or heading out to the north slope, but it may mean taking a second job and reducing what you spend to the bare minimum.  Listen to the people here and you'll make it through.

Good luck! |-| 
|-| cog4sa3 || 112 || You owe almost entire year of debt on your cars alone, if I know this subreddit at all, the recommendation would be to sell both and get something decent for around $10k at most. |-| 
|-| cog1yea || 97 || Student loans are typically not able to be discharged through bankruptcy, which it seems like most of your debt is.

The first thing to do is create a solid budget.  But even with that, I don't think you have the luxury of being a single income family.  If your wife stays home with your son, can she also nanny other kids to bring in some income?  Work part time on a different schedule than yours? |-| 
|-| cog7u4e || 36 || You need to do 3 things:

1) Make more money. I had much the same issue as you - I studied what I loved (thanks, Mom), and graduated with a rather useless BA in Philosophy. I really enjoyed the courses and think it was really interesting and made me a better thinker, but nobody was hiring philosophers out of college. I worked hard, ended up going back to school to get an MBA about 5 years after my undergrad, and am doing just fine now. 

It's likely to be a rough couple of years for you, as it's hard to jump up immediately. Look for career paths with significant long-term potential (does a warehouse job lead to warehouse manager? Warehouse director? Can you see a career path there?). Work your ass off and in a few years you should be making significantly more money.

2) Look into options for dealing with your debt. You could negotiate directly with the credit card company. You could look into income-based repayment for your student loans (not sure if that's an option - I don't really know much about it, but I have a couple of friends who are doing it). Consider selling both of those cars and buying less expensive vehicles.

3) You need to start thinking more critically about finances. Student loan for a degree is one thing - lots of people make that decision. But, after graduating with 100k in debt, you bought TWO cars on credit, racked up another 11k in credit card debt, and are having a child. I'm not here to berate you, but I hope you learn from this experience - there are financial consequences to the decisions you make, and you've made a lot of high-cost decisions in a very short period of time without having either the assets or the income to afford them. 

This is not an unfixable situation, but it's one you're going to have to work your ass off to fix. Treat it as tuition in the school of life, and exercise more care in financial decisions in your future. A good rule of thumb - if you can't pay for it outright, don't buy it. The only thing you should consider taking on debt to pay for is a house and an education (and in that case, it's best to only take on debt to pay for an education that will definitely help your career). |-|

|-| cog312t || 208 || You're not going to like this answer, but you have no alternative: You need to make a lot more money.  $30K/year doesn't come close to cutting it to repay an outstanding student loan balance of $130K, which you won't be able to discharge in bankruptcy.  You have a long road ahead of you -- potentially decades long -- in getting out from under this debt.  Good luck. |-| 
|-| cog24nb || 27 || Fellow Western Maryland resident here. Jobs may be tough but at least rent/housing is cheap.  Leverage that any way you can, that's a major advantage of living here instead of PA or VA.

Have you considered a management job, or something like Retail?  There's probably a lot of opportunities in Hagerstown to look at, and I'd expect them to pay in the $17-20 range. If you can commute to Hagerstown and not live in Hagerstown, even better. |-| 
|-| coga2kc || 154 || This is with all seriousness.


1. Get off reddit


2. Treat your job search like a job. In order to overcome this you will need to go outside your comfort zone and find work elsewhere. I highly suggest a form of manual labor; Oil Field Worker ($60K+), Construction ($50k+), etc.. Once you get that job, learn learn learn. The more you learn the more value you create. The more value you create the more money a company has to pay to keep you around. 


3. Sell your cars, get something manageable.


4. Set 5, 10, 15, 20 year goals. If your actions are in conflict of these goals DO NOT DO IT. Your credit will go down the crapper regardless, so do not let your currently situation get the better of you. That will make everything worse.


5. If this hurts your feelings I apologize. Your actions have caused you to be on the verge of homelessness. That is not how a mature adult, mature father, goes about finances.


6. Pick your head up and kick some ass! Stay hungry for employment and success and you will do fine! Congrats on the child and I wish you the best of luck!

|-| cog6vpj || 155 || It seems like you've followed a pattern of putting what you want first and disregarded the financial impact.  Is that pattern going to change starting today or are you going to continue?  There will always be someone saying things like "major in what you love" and the new versions will be "a baby needs a SAHM" and "you should really have your 2nd kid before the first gets too old"

Why is your wife out of work if she hasn't given birth yet?  That's months of income blown for no reason.  Do you have a budget?  I don't understand how you're expecting to be able to switch to a single income.  You need to start considering the financial implications of these decisions.  You may have to have you both working jobs at different shifts in order to get by- She works in the evening, you work in the daytime, and one of you works on the weekend. |-| 
|-| cog6q7s || 18 || What about your wife going back to work after having the baby? I realize that it is a difficult and heartbreaking decision to return to work after having a child, but you may not have a choice if you cannot make it on one income. You may be saving on childcare by having her stay at home but you're probably losing a lot more in possible income. |-| 
|-| cog7slz || 20 || &gt;We have considered cutting back to one car so that she can stay home with our son (this saves money on child care and also reduces insurance, gas, and removes a car payment from out bills).
Back to the issue at hand. My students loans Have been racking up interest and now sit at comfy $130k. I all but exhausted my forbearance. Add the 11k credit card and 10k left on my car and 15k on hers, our debit to income ratio is shot.

I know a lot of people have talked on the job prospects, so listen to that advice.

But get a plan here. And I realize that's why you're in this sub.

Sell the cars and get rid of that debt. Tackle every bit of debt you can. 

Wife and I just had our first child three months ago, and she went back to work. It sucks. She hates it most days. But as we look at our financial prospects, it's momentary and soon she'll be at home full time as a mom thankfully.

So, I would start in fixing the car situation to get rid of that debt, and then budget like there's no tomorrow while figuring out the income issue.  |-| 
|-| cog26d2 || 34 || Okay... a couple quick questions. 

First, what specifically was your degree in? (Fellow fine-arts major here) Photo? Illustration? Art History?

Second, you said you moved back home - I'm assuming you mean to your hometown. Do you rent? Own a house? Is there a family member or friend you could move in with/have move in with you, in order to cut or remove your rent/mortgage payments? |-| 
|-| cogeexr || 45 || Your loans are not the problem, your terrible decision making is the problem. Sorry to be rude but it's the truth.  You have $25k **LEFT** on your cars. You shouldn't have been paying $25k *total* on them, that's like an entire year's salary for you. And then you put a wedding on a credit card and have a kid too?

As many people have said bankruptcy will not get rid of your student loans, however it might still be worth it if you can find a mode of transportation afterwards.  The car loans really kill you though because if you become bankrupt you'll lose the cars and then have no money to buy another one. But if you can take the bus/carpool/ have your family loan you some money for a beater etc then it might work while you start saving some money back up. 

Even then though it will be extremely hard, with your wife either not working or spending almost all her money on childcare you'll be essentially be supporting 3 people + paying off a sizable student loan on $30,000 a year. You can just make minimum payments but then of course you'll be paying for decades. Unfortunately there isn't any real good option for you but that might be the least bad. |-| 
|-| cog9d5k || 14 || Is there a reason you bought such expensive cars when you already had so much debt? $25k on cars alone is so steep when you have so many other concerns as well. Could you sell one (or both) and get cheaper cars? 

You may want to talk to someone professionally about how to best tackle the debt and in which order you should do things. I know that often advice is given to get rid of the highest interest debt first (like the credit cards) and then move on to the others.

And jeez, a kid? Yikes. 

 |-| 
|-| cogaoxr || 28 || Get rid of both cars. Get an old but reliable vehicle for 5k max.  |-| 
|-| cog7tfp || 29 || You need to cut expenses drastically and others can help you with that. I can make some recommendations for increasing income:

When you say you studied art. Was it studio art or art history? Let's look at job potential. Are there near-by museums? People with studio art background make for great "preparators" (aka "art handlers") packing/crating/hanging artwork. Having warehouse experience also can make you a bit more appealing. Did you deal with logistics at all (planing/scheduling shipments, etc?) did you at least pick up a little of how things were done even if you didn't do it yourself? Did you deal on any level with the inventory tracking system of the warehouse? Common questions that they'll ask (being as the installation/preparators often have a close relationship with the registrar who is more logistics oriented) will be have you used a museum collections management system, you can say something like "no I haven't used one for collections management but I have worked with inventory tracking systems in warehouse work and I tend to pick up computer systems pretty quick."  Once you're in as a preparator, you might be able to help out with other departments (smaller museums always need help in every field... maybe you can use some of that graphic design experiance). Art galleries often also need perparators.

If you studied more art history, admin/secretary work is a great field that art history majors are often appreciated as you've had to write tons of essays and probably have writing and editing skills (make sure to spell that out on your resume).

Consider 2nd jobs... bartending at night (find some cheaper bars and see if they need a bar-back)

Consider jobs that will pay off your loans. Military/GI bill is often focused on, but there are other programs like [Teach for America](https://www.teachforamerica.org/) |-| 
|-| cogaqdv || 12 || Your wife needs to find a job that will allow her to work from home - you need extra income somewhere. Attempting to live on your income solely is unfair and will only cripple your marriage and your child's future.

You can probably already tell by now that bringing another person into this world (even if it's what you always wanted) was a selfish decision to make under these circumstances. This isn't just your future anymore, it's your child's future now too.

If you're a graphic designer, there's plenty of business to be had in etsy shops, freelance web design, etc. Find your niche. What do you like? Are you a huge video game fan? Make decals for video games (there was a post somewhere on reddit awhile back from someone that made roughly 10k every holiday season from printing re-designed video game decals on ornaments).

Look, I understand your pain. I'm in a lot of debt too from my illustration degree from a private university. I love art as a hobby but there's not much of a future in it unless I go back to be a professor. So instead, I'm taking some classes at community college for cheap (roughly a grand and a half every semester) to get my RN license. We all make mistakes - you just have to find the right path to getting a better income and fixing your's.  |-| 
|-| cog4lfm || 10 || As previously mentioned, student loans general aren't discharged in bankruptcy. Secondly, creating a budget, selling a car, and trimming the expenses are all probably necessary at this point.

Moreover, biting the bullet and getting a second job or even exploring looking into moving to cheaper rent or in with a relative to reduce living expenses could be considered.

Lastly, look into an income based repayment schedule for your loans and look at your interest rates. The reason I say that is because there are companies out there such as sofi.com that you can refinance public and private loans with 3-4% rates over 5, 10, &amp; 15 years. 

Keep your head up. It's gonna be tough and it's going to take time. Discipline and hard work will get you through this! And congrats on the newest addition to your family!

|-| cog8it6 || 9 || Just posting on here to say read, re-read, and then read again /u/Wolfie305 's post. If you were thinking of taking some GD classes, start. You don't need another degree, but 1, 2, or 3 classes teaching you how to use photoshop could get you a hell of a long ways, if you're artistically inclined. Then, you can try to do some work for cheap or free, for people you know, just to get a portfolio together. Look for something at a community college, those are pretty cheap. All you really need is to understand how to use Photoshop. Then you can apply your artistic skills with it. 

If you can find a GD job, you can make a pretty good living. 

Source, I work in IT and know that good GDs get paid a decent wage. 

Rant time. Not knocking you OP, but this get a degree in something you love bullshit pisses me off. It's not your fault, that's what you're taught/told. I wish that parents, counselors, and other people who are supposed to "guide" you in life would be a little more realistic. Had someone said, you love art, why not get a degree in graphic design and minor in art, or vice versa. That would of helped you immensely, in the real world (you know where you have to live after college) with getting a job. 

I love, love, love to play music. However, I didn't major in it because I knew outside of teaching, job prospects were pretty low or didn't pay a lot. I went into programming instead, because I knew I'd need a decent job when I graduated, and that major would give me the best shot at it. Best choice I've ever made in life. Oh, and my music, all that extra income, holidays, and time off gives me plenty of time to still play.  |-|

|-| cogc9nj || 77 || This post blows my mind since a normal thought process of someone who is 6 figures into debt would be to put off money consuming activities until debts are paid off. OP went ahead and moved to a city that isn't established in his industry, took a dead end job, got married, bought two cars and a house, and had a child.

Our generation in Korea and Japan are actively avoiding dating, marriage and childbirth because they have difficulty getting a stable full time career, paying for a house and looking after a child. And there is OP.

I want to be sympathetic but all I can say is the word irresponsible. |-| 
|-| cog82ap || 10 || Alright. Two principles to getting out of this: maximize earnings, minimize expenditures. 

The most obvious thing is to first **Understand your expenditures**

At first glance, it looks like you are losing money faster than you are earning it. Assuming your averaged APR is a low 6%, you're paying about $10k/yr in interest this year, and you're probably spending more than $20k/yr on bills and living expenses (for sure when she goes into labor). This stuff will be devastating to put hard numbers onto, but if you don't do it you will never catch up. Do it alone if it helps, do a little at a time...but do it. You need to make a spreadsheet of all of your individual debts by principle, APR, and minimum monthly payment. You must pay those minimum monthly payments. Same sheet, add in lines for your property that is depreciating; put the annual depreciation rate in as the APR. Now you can easily see how quickly your debt is draining you. I don't care how bad your situation seems, you can still make it out of this. You will [do it for your child](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/do-it-for-her), for your wife, and then for yourself. 

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) is the best general guide I've ever found; I keep a PDF copy in case something happens to it.

Honestly, right now I don't care how cheap your living costs are, I just don't see you improving your situation at all if you don't increase your income substantially.

|-| cog9gdi || 16 || As others have already said, student loans don't get discharged with bankruptcy. Neither does alimony payments. My thoughts:

1. Unfortunately you need to work multiple jobs, and they may not be jobs you like. Now you can't do this forever, because you can't kill yourself. But I'd say for the next two years, you need to work two full time jobs.

2. Do you have a family member that can watch the kids? When my kids were young, my mother-in-law used to work nights and helped us out watchting them during the day. Do you have someone like that in the family? Because...

3. Your wife is going to have to work too. With the debt that you have, it would be great if you could drop at least $20K a year down on your debt for three years or so to get it to a more manageable level. The quicker you get your debt to a more manageable level, the better. Nobody wants to be 75 and still working (like my mother was!). 

4. Get rid of one of the cars - you'll have to be a one care family for now. Many people do it and it may be tough, but right now with the salary/debt ratio, you don't have the luxury of having two cars.

5. Hold off on having any more kids - sure, many people say "fuck it, I want my kids", but it's being selfish to the child when they want to go to baseball practice or dance or whatever and you can't afford those things. 

6. If I remember reading your post correctly, you moved in with your family, then got your own place? If I'm correct, you'll need to move back in with your family if at all possible. You can make up for not paying for rent by fixing things around the house, mowing the lawn, shoveling snow, etc. 

7. Is there a reason why you're not working in the field that you went to college for? I don't know where you live, but I would gather that would pay more money. |-|

1. Getting rid of your 2nd car

2. Selling your other one for as much as possible and buying a cheaper replacement, even if you can profit a few thousand from the car sale it will help.

3. Picking up more work, that may mean as much as three jobs if you can balance it. 

4. Considering moving to another City that has higher paying work, lower cost of living and lower taxes.

5. Doing a strict budget using a spread sheet to view every dollar you currently make and spend to know how much and where to trim money. Keep all of your receipts.

6. Cooking only at home, no more eating out.

7. Buying only essential items, no luxuries. You can set up rewards but they should be small and spread out.

8. Paying your highest interest debt will help the most as you will be paying more interest on those debts which is more money needlessly spent long term. 

9. Project your debt payments at the most reasonable rate that you can maintain with your current salary to see how long it will take you pay everything off. Without an actual end goal time frame you won't be able to make educated financial decisions to stay on track. If you end up making more money then factor that in too.

10. Have financial talks with your wife often (weekly?), by keeping the communication open you can keep focus on reducing and repaying your debt. 

11. Eventually you will need to decide if you can use your degree and if at some point you will need to take different schooling for a higher paying job. You should take your time to interview people in the job field you want to be in before spending money on school again.

12. You should set away emergency funds while paying down debt in case either of you lose your jobs. It is important to pay down debt quickly but also to have a safety net in place.

- How are your or your SO's parents? Are they retired? Can they babysit your newborn so that you both can work during the day?
- Living situation - can you move back home into one of your parent's places and save on rent? How big is your current place? How much can you save if you move into a 400 sq ft apartment?
- Luxuries - cancel your cable bill, go back to using flip phones. Cancel the data plans and stuff. Buy the cheap toilet paper. You shouldn't even have a tv. If you have time for tv and facebook, you have time for a 2nd job.
- Cut up all of your credit cards. You need not be tempted by more credit and you need to become a cash payer until you're out of debt.

These measures are not comfortable. You will not enjoy life while digging your way out. You will have little or no time with your son. But if persevere, you can realistically get rid of all your debt in 4 years or so. You can have a fresh start as a family and have time for each other. If you don't do this, you WILL jeopardize your future and the future of your son. |-|

   3.  They eventually will try to reach a settlement, as in how much you should pay them. It can be somewhere from  20-80% of what you owed, depending how bad your situation is. They need a "recovery" from the your defaulted loan.

   4.  Your credit is now shot, it will take nearly a decade to bring that puppy back up. But in that time, be frugal and advance your career in arts. You can easily pick up new skills and software from YouTube Tutorials at your own pace and incorporate these skills into your resume.

Did your wife have to leave work months before having the baby? The extra income could really help.

If you can, you'll probably want to look at getting rid of the car. Babies aren't expensive in general. They don't need tons of stuff. The most expensive things will be formula, if your wife can't/doesn't want to breastfeed and diapers, if you prefer not to go cloth, which I've heard can be cheaper in the long run.

After that, you just have to find better paying work. There is no way you can tackle student loans this big, especially private ones without increasing your income.

Put your federal loans on IBR and then see if that help. They will continue to grow until you can start making more and putting more toward them.  |-|

If you qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (https://studentaid.ed.gov/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/charts/public-service) or any other similar programs then consider getting your monthly payment reduced as much as possible and then getting a job that qualifies so that after 120 payments your loans can be forgiven.

Sell your vehicles and buy a cheap minivan (ugly but awesome if you have kids trust me) and a sedan for yourself for $5k or a little under (buy japanese on the private market and get it inspected). You obviously have no business owning anything more expensive and that price range is where you get the best long term cost savings.

Best of luck to you.  |-| 
|-| cogawqe || 5 || You need to get other sources of income.  Although it will take some sacrifices there are plenty of options.  Drive uber, deliver pizza, sell your artwork, bar tend nights and weekends, etc.  Also, take a real hard look at your expenses.  Go down to one cell phone, one car, cut cable,  never eat out, take advantage of free entertainment.  Cutting an $80 cable bill equates to about $1,000 in savings each year.   |-|

|-| cogj769 || 5 || &gt;  I've been stuck in my own head about my financial state; its fucked so why bother. But now I am more focused. As someone mentioned in a comment I am ready to bare this on my shoulders, all of these issues, both personal and financial are mine to deal with. Also please do not think that I am living in poverty. I'm not my wife and I are comfortable but things are going to get tight and I'm exploring all my options to make things better for our family.

Have you really turned a corner on your mindset? You are at -130k dude, that is not something you should be comfortable with. Why *aren't* you living in poverty? Going without whatever "comforts" you are thinking of - that is how you're going to bear this on your shoulders, not filling out some paperwork you never thought to ask about.

Until you stop being "comfortable" that debt is just going to keep hanging over your head and growing.  I would say growing out of control, but you weren't controlling it before, really... just getting away with ignoring it.

Was your wife making so little that your family will really come out ahead by having her give up her job? Granted, spending all day away from your kid, earning $150 so you can pay $100 for child care (throwing out example numbers here) not to mention the cost of owning, insuring, and fueling a car... that hurts but... |-|

|-| cog9q9g || 4 || You can do IBR (Income Based Repayment) for 20 years and then your student loan will be forgiven after that as long as you pay on time and apply every single year.  The interest will still grow, which is scary, but as long as you stick with the program, that should go away, too.  I have an $85,000 loan and only pay $180 a month, so it is very manageable. If I wasn't using IBR, I would be paying $550 a month.  Look into it. |-|

You'll want to join as enlisted, not officer. There are some real perks, like housing, health care, stable employment, and they will pay off your student loans. See which branch will do the most for you - Air Force,  Army, Navy or Marines - and get over this hump.

|-| cogms9k || 5 || This article says shockingly 40% of people who applied for bankruptcy of student loans were successful.  Now part of this is selection bias since many people probably don't try, but what's the harm in trying?  You have to show "undue hardship"

|-| cog6tnz || 3 || That sucks,  dude.  I have plenty of student loan debt myself so can empathize.  The unfortunate news is it's time for you to man up,  roll up your sleeves,  and get to work paying off the money you borrowed and promised to pay back.  The banks will get their pound of flesh from you so better to do it the right way than force them to garnish your wages.

Investigate if consolidating  is a good option; I did this with the Department of Education and it worked out very well for me.  Read books and apply the advice of financial coaches like Dave Ramsey,  et al.  Work two jobs and probably put the wife to work too when she is able. And figure out ways to increase your income.    Most importantly mentally prepare for a many years long process. 

One thing I advise is to not do the income based plans because the unpaid interest capitalizes into the principal,  so it just grows and grows and then your entire amount to pay back just gets bigger,  and you get buried even more. So unless you're okay with having,  essentially,  a 30 year mortgage for your future,  I advise you forgoe any income based 'help'  and just pay go with a standard plan (the reality is the income based plans are a dastardly way for the banks to screw you even more). 

Good luck and keep your chin up. |-| 
|-| cogbqyu || 3 || As a suggestion to make some extra money, create art tutorials for those online schools or host classes in your area. Work with book clubs or other clubs that may be interested in have an art class taught by you. You could host art parties or do art at a birthday party and teach kids how to do cool stuff. That will also get you networking connections. Maybe someone knows of a better job opportunity open! Plenty of jobs I know are word of mouth will want to hire friends or friends of friends since trust is involved. Sometimes it's who you know! |-| 
|-| cogbzwx || 4 || Even if you exclude student loans, you've not been responsible with money or spending at all in your life. Most of your decisions appear to be made without the future in mind.

Time to man up and face reality. You need to work, spend less, and budget. Adulthood has a lot of responsibility, but it is still rewarding. Good luck |-| 
|-| cogd3l1 || 3 || You need to utilize that degree in order to make more money. Look for work across any industry. I went job shopping a few years ago and found a pharmaceutical company that was looking for my skill set and also had a shit ton of artists in that office. I worked in slot machines and they had artists for their cabinet baffles, glass, top displays, art, publications, websites...

There are also online communities where people who need artists can find and contract artists. I used to run a web company and we would occasionally pay for web development. Related: learn a little HTML and the like. With this, you can contract on the side, and bid for work.

You also need a budget. I suggest Mint, because it's free. Also use unbury.me, an online tool, to plan your payments from now until paid.

You may have to swallow some pride for what I'm about to cover. There are government programs out there to help those in need; some people are too proud to even consider them. But, if you apply, then that means you are the target audience for these programs.

Consider low cost housing. [Section 8](http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/hcv). It's not glamorous, but it can cut costs. Get [food stamps](http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap); that's a federal program, but states also offer their own programs. For any given federal program, there is probably also a state program.

If you don't have health insurance, or crappy health insurance, look into the Affordable Care Act; you can probably get vouchers to discount the cost.

If your wife is unskilled and under 25, she can consider the [Job Corps](http://www.jobcorps.gov/home.aspx) and get paid, room and board, to learn a skill. They may also have job placement.

Also consider taking advantage of non-profit public welfare programs like lunch lines and soup kitchens. Subsidize your costs any way you can.

Good luck. |-|

|-| coglwqr || 3 || My 2 cents. Please just read this as me being a Ra Ra football coach, not as some know it all. 

You do need to significantly change your income and expenses. That MrMoneyMustache.com website is fantastic, at learning how to play defense with your expenses. (posted by someone else, I upvoted it too)

You also need to focus on offense. My sister helped me write my resume. Within 9 months, I had a much better job and salary. It's not something I am expert enough to give advice on, but learn about writing a resume and building it.  

With respect, get over the ART degree thing. I have no degree. I learned a skill\trade. I work in IT. People care more about what value you bring them than anything else. A degree is a nice establishment that you can achieve long term goals, just don't let it be the end of that statement, or a road block. Own it in interviews. "Yea I did that, 4 long years, and this is what else I can do!"

Restricting job searches to where you are currently, will restrict your career growth. Do some research, find the career you want, find where those jobs are, and push to the rank you want. I found it easier to move up in big markets. Smaller markets have some of the high level jobs, but usually don't have the ladder to move up or want someone who's already done it before. Go get it, don't let yourself think otherwise.

Debt is a monster monkey on the back. Find ways to relieve stress. Probably exercise is the cheapest and best way. This could be as simple as hiking on a cool trail, which I myself love.

Lastly, put a plan down on paper. This comes from a monthly budget of living and loan expenses. Find out what you need to make to pay minimum payments. Find out how long this will take to pay everything. Calculate your minimum salary you can find yourself living on, and stop at NOTHING to get it. Desire and a plan will get you everywhere. Then calculate what $50, $100, $500 more a month might take off in time. Use this as a guide for future life decisions.  Write it all down. This will ease uncertainty, which is, in my experience, a lot of the stress of financial hardship.
 |-| 
|-| cogna6c || 3 || I too would like to see some explanation or discussion about what to actually do in this situation.  My student loans are about the same as the OP.  It's hard to really see any possible solution other than making the minimum payment for the rest of your life. |-|

I would erase in your mind, your college/degrees/majors/etc.

Focus get any job you can, in any field that will hire you right now.

Then be very frugal, save massively, spend very little, and gradually pay back your college debt.

|-| cog4ab7 || 12 || Your loans won't be discharged through bankruptcy. 


Obviously your income alone isn't going to cut it.  How much did you wife make before the pregnancy?  You need to be job searching whenever you have free time.  Getting your income up should be your #1 priority.  Hopefully you aren't upside down on one of those cars.

As a father I'd be leary to dump another car, just using one to go to work and let the mother with an infant stay home alone, what if something happens and your wife needs to take her somewhere? I'm not just talking about getting hurt, there's always 911 and an ambulance for that, what if a family member needs your wife assistance immediately and she's stuck at home? What about when your wife is going to go back to work after maternity? Are you going to purchase a beater and put it on liability?
I'm just trying to be preventive and I must admit I'm probably paranoid. Our family situation may very well be different than yours so you probably don't need it, and you guys will evaluate what to do as far as the child care goes, your wife at home or back to work and pay for a provider.

Just my two cents, I wish you guys the very best.
 |-| 
|-| cog95je || 4 || Do not take Reddit comments for an answer to the question whether bankruptcy will discharge student loans.  Correct, it is a difficult standard to meet, but you could meet it your situation is so bad.  So, talk to a good bankruptcy attorney with experience in student loan debt about it before you rule out that option.  Usually the first consultation is free. |-| 
|-| cogd1dq || 3 || First of all, it should be a crime to give out these kind of loans for these types of degrees without a serious plan of action. Doing it because you love it does not justify doing it. It sucks that nobody gave you this advice before getting $130k in debt. This was a poor choice, now how can we fix it?

Its hard to suggest what fields you or your wife could pursue, but I've seen mentioned before graphic design. I personally would suggest that you self teach yourself some programming languages such as java or c#, HTML &amp; CSS, through Lynda tutorials, MVA, or a local community college. Then you might be able to be a bit more marketable with your art degree. An art degree will get you basically nothing. (Granted there are some exceptions, I know this) but if you have some programming knowledge, it can exponentially jump up your resume and marketability, because of lot of programmers have little design flair. You'd then immediately have an edge over others. You could start off instantly making a minimum of double what you're making now as a junior developer. Just a possible solution for you and your wife and you won't need a degree in computer science. They look for what kind of portfolio you have and not just what degree you have. Hope this helps, good luck. |-| 
|-| cogb30h || 4 || How the hell do you spend 130k on an art degree... |-|

|-| cog9pj2 || 3 || Your student loans can be discharged in bankruptcy if you can prove the debt causes an "undue hardship" on you and your dependents. You should talk to a good, trustworthy bankruptcy attorney. It is certainly worth a shot. |-| 
|-| cogicuy || 3 || First off, I'm seeing mostly shitty advice a saying 'well why don't you just earn more money or cut expenses' being up voted. That's not what you wanted to know about.

1. Don't be discouraged by these commentators, clearing student debt is possible. Talk to several lawyers, you can shop around and get plenty of advice. Try to find one that specifically handles student loan bankruptcy but remember if you have a co-signer then the balance will go into default and your co-signer could face having the loan company go after them for the entire balance at once.   

2. For your federal loans sign up for income based repayment on all of them. It will keep payments affordable and if you do declare bankruptcy then you will be able to show the judge that you are trying your best to make payments. 

3. Look into loan consolidation. 321loans is what a friend of mine went through. He pays $425 a month on about 75k of debt. 

4. Consider default on the private loans if bankruptcy is not happening. They will probably garnish your wages but  in West Virginia, the most that can be garnished from your wages is:
20% of your disposable earnings for that week, or
the amount by which your disposable earnings for the week exceed 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage (currently $7.25/hour), whichever is less.
 |-| 
|-| cog689l || 3 || I'm under the impression that private student loans can be discharged through bankruptcy, while federal loans cannot.  I am not 100% certain of this. Obviously you have some research to do.

You should file for income based repayment for your federal loans. Considering your current financial situation you would most likely have a payment of zero. That isn't a deferment. After x number of years (20?) the balance of your loan will be forgiven if you remain in the program the entire time. 

You must enroll in income based repayment for your federal loans!

As for your fiance, if he had no income, he doesn't need to file. But who paid his living expenses? Presumably, he was dependent on on someone (his parents? you?). If it was his parents, they can claim him. If it was you, he would have had to have lived with you the entire year to be your dependent since you're not related (http://www.irs.gov/publications/p501/ar02.html#en_US_2014_publink1000220868). |-|

Even with multiple incomes, deductions and other nigglies, I've always done my tax free at home within about 30min, with the Australian government E-tax software.

|-| cog3xdf || 40 || It hasn't been mentioned yet, but the value of your items is likely far less than you think it is. Obviously, it is worth exactly what the secondary market will pay for it, but I counsel you to reduce your expectations. That $1800 leather couch might reasonably be worth $500 or less in the used market. 

I consistently see people posting ads on Craigslist saying things like, "I paid $1800 for this couch 2 years ago. You can buy it for $1700 now". 

That said, go ahead and throw everything on CL. Search for similar items in your area or surrounding areas and use that as your basis for pricing. Take good pictures and give a full description.  Stick to your price on Craigslist for at least a week on major furniture items. You're right that there are a lot of scammers on CL, but there are also a bunch of people just like you and me who might shop for items on the secondary market. |-| 
|-| cog4zxa || 32 || &gt;We are trying to recoup some of those bills he left behind. Any advice is appreciated

You are not responsible for your dad's debts. Those debts die with him. Technically those items are part of his estate. Probate should handle all the sale/auction of those items if they think it is worth the time. You may actually even get in trouble for selling his assets without permission from the state. If he has debts you can't raid his belongings of all of the expensive stuff so the creditors get screwed.

But give all of the debt collectors a copy of the death certificate and tell them all to go fuck themselves and to deal with the estate, not you. |-|

Good news: You aren't responsible for his debts.  They will be paid out of his estate.

|-| cog3zxh || 11 || The problem with really nice furniture right now is that there is a glut of it.

If it really is nice, you could see about finding a consignment shop that may be able to market it better.

|-| cog5ro6 || 4 || Does the estate have an executor?  Have them contact an auction house and have it auctioned.  You will have to pay the auction fee, probably a moving fee if you don't deliver it yourself, and some other stuff. 

But if you put it in a busy and reputable auction, you'll probably get the biggest bang for your buck.  If you don't want to do that, contact an estate sale group - these are more for when you are selling every damn thing in the house, though.

The reason I ask for the executor, is that it's his job to settle the estate. Heirs do not inherit debt, however the estate should pay any debts, and if they have to liquidate the estate to do it, then so be it.  But that's the job of the executor, and he may have to report to probate court what the inventory was, what it was sold for and which creditors were paid in what order. |-|

|-| cogvy5e || 6 || Well done! |-| 
|-| cog9skf || 18 || The software are probably correct.  Here is my guess at why it happened.  The U.S. income tax system uses marginal rates.  Since you are single:

* The first $9,075 of taxable income you made in 2014 is taxed at 10%.

* Taxable income you made from $9,076 to $36,900 is taxed at 15%.

* Taxable income you made from $36,901 to $89,350 is taxed at 25%.

Based on your salary, your payroll system tries to withhold an even amount every paycheck to satisfy what your _effective_ tax rate will be at the end of the year.


You have $50,908.49 of earned income listed.  Standard deduction is $6,200, so let's forget everything else and assume your taxable income is $44,708.49. If you apply the tiers above to get a total amount of taxes on $44,708.49, you'd get an answer of $7,033.  That makes your _effective_ tax rate on adjusted gross income 15.7%.

The problem is that your second job doesn't know you had income in the year from another job.  It thinks you are making $38,691 for the year and doesn't realize you actually have $50,908.  From its perspective, your taxable income is more like $32,491 and you don't get out of of the 15% marginal tax bracket, so the effective tax rate is about 13.6%.  When the reality is you have a good chunk of income that falls within the 25% bracket.

If you take the difference between your actual effective tax rate and what your new job's payroll expected, it's about 2.1%.  And 2.1% of your $44,708 taxable income is about $1K..

Incidentally, this is the same reason that bonuses are withheld at a higher tax rate.  A decent guess at your effective tax rate can be used for withholding of your known salary, but unplanned income such as bonuses are fully withheld at your top marginal rate, since they cause you to fill more of the highest bucket.

EDIT: I'm not a finance or accounting person and I'm sure I'm oversimplifying this, but I believe the general gist is accurate..
 |-| 
|-| cog76jp || 21 || If you have more than 1 job you can't use the instructions on the W4 form. Both jobs assume that job is your only income. Use the IRS withholding calculator in the future. |-| 
|-| cogjhwg || 5 || I don't understand why people complain when they owe taxes and are happy when they get a rebate.

I had a coworker who asked me how can they get a rebate on taxes since they prefer that over paying taxes. I gave up explaining to her why it really makes no difference because they didn't understand how taxes work and "just wanted money in April"

Unless you trigger underpayment penalties, it's actually better to owe some taxes than get a refund. Tax refunds are just really a free loan to the IRS. I always aim to slightly owe some taxes every year.

If you didn't trigger any underpayment penalties, I would say it's a good thing you are owing $1500. But like others said, the reason why you probably triggered it is because you had two jobs, you should've filled out your W4 different for the second job. |-| 
|-| cog91fi || 5 || Two things to note:

* 1) Since/IF you owe more than $1000, the Fed may charge you a penalty for this. (I'm in a similar boat but am saved thanks to point 2) 

* 2) You wont pay a penalty if you paid at least as much tax as you paid in the prior year.

If you have a high deductible health plan and an HSA, you could consider maxing out your account ~$3,250 (approximately double if married) and a Traditional IRA if you haven't contributed yet ($5,500 S / $11,000 M).  All you need to do is deposit before April 15.  Also, I recommend using an actual accountant to help you out if you wish to reduce your tax liability and not run afoul of any rules or regulations.

You should tell the original creditor that you're in touch with the collection agency that claims to own the debt, and confirm that they do. Ask for written proof.

You now can dispute that from your credit report. 

Next is to work with the original creditor to settle the debt.  |-| 
|-| cog8a2j || 3 || Im in a similiar scenario and ive followed the usual advice of requesting verification and instead of getting proof i ended up getting both the debt listed and 4 other medical debts i was never made aware of instantly reported on my credit, ive sent multiple letters requesting they remove the items and verify the debts with no luck..its absurd i have to go through so much just to get them to comply with federal laws |-|

|-| cog0tvd || 6 || Yes, you need to claim it. 

Send in an amended return and you're good to go. |-| 
|-| cogeatw || 5 || Just to nitpick; you *claim* a deduction. This is income; you *declare* income (which your bank has *reported* to both you and the IRS.) |-| 
|-| cogky7b || 24 || If they are paying her in cash you can bet they are not paying unemployment nor Workers Comp on her either. So she get hurt she is screwed.

Also if she is doing deliveries in her personal vehicle she needs to have commercial insurance as your normal insurance will not cover it.

There must be a W-4 or W-9 filled out and most likely it should be a W-4. IRS loathes allowing a large environment like a restaurant us a 1099 as money goes missing. Most tip places must also track the tips to assure minimum wage is met and that it is reported, Domino drivers fill out tip forms.

I would be cautious as if they will cheat the IRS they will cheat you and if they get caught they will could come back after her for SS and medicare not withheld. |-| 
|-| cogibg7 || 17 || Not a tax professional and I don't really know the differences of tip jobs, but here's what I'd do:

1. Keep track of all her pay and tips.  A ledger would be a great investment.  She is still responsible for reporting her income no matter what her work does.

2. Request a W4 from her work now, for tax withholding.

3. If they refuse, contact the Department of Labor and report her employer. If she is not a contractor, this is illegal.  Not only are they not reporting federal taxes, but they are evading paying their FICA taxes as well.

4. Next January, request a W2.

5. If they refuse to issue her a W2, contact the IRS.  There are forms for these kinds of situations, and again her employer will get in trouble.

In my opinion, it's not OK to run a business if you don't understand how proper employment policies works, and break the law because "it's easier and cheaper."  That's now how it works. |-| 
|-| cogiz8e || -7 || Well, if she really *wants* to, she can just claim her entire cash income when she files her taxes...  Not like the IRS will come back with "NO!  You can't report more than we have documentation for, you must pay *less* taxes *or else*!".

A W2/1099 just gives the IRS a lower limit to how much you made.  In the absence of that, you can report just about any number you want - **Including** the correct one, if you feel so inclined. |-| 
|-| cogicd6 || -5 || she probably is getting paid under the table.  she might be able to qualify as a 1099 independent contractor but it's unlikely.  so i guess find a different job?   |-| 
|-| cog3ud6 || 42 || You have no choice here.  I don't think anyone is going to give you a loan for the difference, except at a very high interest rate.

You also don't mention the interest rate on this loan?  

I think you probably need to pay this loan off and never do whatever you did to get that loan again.  |-| 
|-| cog6thc || 8 || Man, I would get into a job or two while you're in school. **If you aren't collecting disability** I would consider calling a prior service recruiter and look at some non-obiligated reserve time. It isn't ideal... but it's an easy $200/month (or more) to supplement a part time job.


If you are in a serious pinch, consider military OneSource. 


I was in a similar situation in college and I got my bills down as low as possible, drilled with the reserves, picked up two part time jobs and another little side gig, and paid off my wedding debt. It's not the same, but you can definitely pull through it with a little sweat |-| 
|-| cog73gv || 6 || How could you be so far under in only 6 months? What kind of car is it? |-| 
|-| cog7req || 6 || What does it matter if you are upside down on the car loan right now? Obviously this is not something you want to ever do again, but what does it matter at this moment. You will not be able to get rid of the debt by any type of financing "tricks."

Recommend you get a 2nd job doing something like delivering pizzas at night. It sucks, but the only way out of this is to keep paying.

Once the loan is no longer upside down, get rid of the car and by a junker.

 |-| 
|-| cog7ry3 || 6 || You didn't mention the age of the vehicle. 

This will not reverse you being "upside down", but if you are paying a lot of interest on the car, say higher than 3%. You should keep in mind your car is still considered **new** if it is 3 years old or less.

So for instance, my local credit union charges 2% for a new auto loan. Quite a bit better than the 6% I was paying when I initially bought the car and financed at the dealship.

After you have the car for a good chunk of time, you'll be less "upside down" as the value stabilizes. You lose say, 30% driving off the lot, but value doesn't continue at that rate of decline over time, your car will decrease in value from the 16k-17k , but gradually. Your "equity" will increase however. Especially if you make larger payments, earlier.

Never let anyone lead you with "What can you afford?". What you can afford is what you want to spend. You clearly do not want to spend $500 a month. Wish I learned that way sooner myself. |-| 
|-| cog856e || 8 || Aside from things everyone else has mentioned, what are you doing with a $499 car payment with just $1,200 in monthly income?

|-| cogoexq || 83 || &gt; Why are people telling me that paying off a credit card when it's due is actually harmful for my credit?

Because they are morons and you need better friends. |-| 
|-| cogognd || 25 || I don't know where the myth that carrying a balance over on your card helps your credit.  It needs to die.  If you are paying interest, you are doing it wrong.

What you do is use your credit card (wisely, of course).  Then, your bill will be processed and you will see 3 numbers.  One is minimum amount due.  Another is the current balance.  And finally the full amount.  Pay the current balance by the due date and you will not pay any interest. 

Don't be late on your payments.  Don't carry a balance.   |-|

Not only are there warnings **all over** craigslist about wire transfers, who even wire transfers money to pay for goods and services these days? It's 2015, time to get a grip on reality. 

In this day and age of debit cards, checking accounts, and services like paypal - it makes me wonder why the term "wire transfer" doesn't signal an immediate red flag whether you are aware of the warnings or not.  |-| 
|-| cogsfb7 || 5 || Wow some shitty  responses on here. But I would try contacting your banks wire department which is most likely closed this time of night so call tomorrow. A wire is a same day transfer of funds so it's most likely already at the bank you sent it to. You can try to have your bank remit the wire  but it's up to the receiving bank to authorize the funds to be sent back. But when it comes down to it whether it's a scam or not you are the one who authorized the wire. So odds of getting that money back is slim to none. Take it as a lesson learned.

Side note- i was going to switch to Taxact, but it was horrible for me. I had a very hard time trying to find where to file everything (school and rental income). During the 10 mins or so on hold for support i started going through turbotax and the stress just left. I hung up when someone finally did answer (i told him why) and filed with TT. I had zero problems.

I paid $80 more than i would have with TaxAct and, for me, it was worth it. Maybe taxact is better for people more familiar with the subject and know where to go. |-|

What are "pay stubs for the bill"?

How can paying for an owed bill be an inconvenient hit to my personal savings? You go get medical work done, payment is due in full. They do not offer terms. Most of the time there may even be a sign stating that payment is due in full at time of treatment. Am I correct?

I read as such:

Hello personal finance reddit, I recently had a medical bill go to collections. I was making minimum payments but broke my " agreement". I was informed by the hospital that it was sent to collections yesterday.

I want to try and resolve this without seriously impacting my credit.

I've collected all of my pay stubs for the bill so I know how exactly much I owed in case the collectors try to contact me. I and told my parents in case they are contacted first.

I can pay it all off as a lump sum but it would be an inconvenient hit to my personal savings. I want to know if paying it off in lump immediately can prevent it from harming my credit score or if I should to to negotiate a payment plan with the CA including a back payment for the missed payment.

I don't know what an SA is or a CA.

The sooner paid off, the sooner it quits harming your Great Credit Score. Hospital or collections agency (CA?) may work with you to keep it from being reported negatively, but, I doubt it. Usually wont go to extreme over one missed payment, you would think.

|-| cogpajm || 5 || Savings Bonds are unlike other bonds in the "bond market."  You can't resell Savings Bonds, there is no secondary market for them.  

An EE bond issued in 1988 looks like it is earning 4%.  What would you do with the money if you were to redeem the bond?  You won't find a risk-free 4% interest rate anywhere else right now.  But if you said you want to cash it in to pay a 20% credit card bill, that's a good move.

You can use the [Savings Bond Calulator](
http://www.treasurydirect.gov/BC/SBCPrice) at TreasuryDirect.gov to calculate the bond's redemption value.

There might be other tax implications (you may be able to redeem tax-free for education expenses, you might want to research that a little bit if it applies).  Also, EE bonds stop accruing interest after 30 years, so if you do hold it, so make sure to redeem it at that point since it won't grow any further.

TurboTax carried this amount over from the previous year, so there was a discrepancy.

|-| cog16f0 || 20 || IMO, an existing car loan is not an emergency. |-| 
|-| cog4sf1 || 6 || I love posting the reverse question and see what sticks, so here we go:

If you had a paid-off car, would you take out a personal loan with your car as collateral and just put that money in your bank account?

Trust me, I agree with the idea of using an emergency fund for an emergency only. But you also have to realize that you have money sitting in a bank *because* you have a car loan. |-| 
|-| cog29gh || 5 || Examples of when to use the emergency fund:

1. An actual emergency where the cost of not using is much greater than the hit to your emergency fund.
2.  You have a loan with lump sum interest that will hit if you do no pay off the entire loan.
3.  You have a credit card or loan at 20%+ interest rate.

On smaller loans like this at 5% interest save the emergency fund and just keep paying as normal. |-| 
|-| cog3wpu || 4 || Going against /r/pf grain since I know we're big on emergency funds here: I would actually pay it off - but only if you're in good financial health and have a stable job situation. Saving $400 over 4 months seems like a decent deal. But by good financial health I mean that you shouldn't have any other consumer debt (no credit card balances) and some type of decent credit facility in the form of, for example, credit cards, home equity loc or family in a position to temporarily borrow from if an emergency hits.

Using it now to pay off your car loan may make it easier to use in the future for other non-emergencies as well. what happens when you use it to pay off the car loan and you run into an emergency situation next month? What happens if you never replenish the amount you used because you forget or just decide not to? Anyway, here's a great article on emergency funds:
