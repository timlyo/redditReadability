|-| cntvlpn || 3 || poor D3. Feeling very little love in korea. |-| 
|-| cntvtu3 || 478 || WoW, LoL and Minecraft are also very popular, but I guess people mostly buy those games digitally, or maybe they just play them in PC Bangs (PC gaming rooms). I did see a lot of kids at school playing Minecraft: Pocket Edition on their phones whenever they had a spare moment. (as well as all the silly Kakao phone games)

Edit: Also, 1000 won is about a dollar (though the exchange rate has changed quite a lot over the past couple of years). So the games are around $36-$55.

Edit 2: Interestingly, this was actually at Toys-R-Us, which is an American store, though they presumably choose their stock for the locals. It's also not a specialised video game store which is part of why the PC gaming section is pretty small. I think this store was at the mall by Gimpo airport if that matters. |-|

That's much more generous that any company nowadays. In Battlefield games, for example, you can't even get into a server that has DLC content.

EDIT: For fuck's sake. I can't believe you people. The company tried to do something nice instead of restricting people who didn't pay from playing and you only get them negative publicity.

EDIT2: /u/Niklasgunner linked [a blog post](http://www.bistudio.com/blog/roadmap-14-15-dlc-strategy-blog) explaining Bohemia Interactive's strategy and why this was done. I'd recommend reading it before making false assumptions.

|-| cnu3uw8 || 41 || Fun fact: They all had a manufacturing flaw which caused them to die out pretty fast. 

This lead to the company who made them go bust about a year after release, unfortunately right before Christmas. So a lot of kids who wanted one at that time for Christmas got screwed over (and the parents who paid around 700-1000 as well).

At least I can say I don't pay into this bullshit. I've never purchased a DLC and don't intend to. Either make it part of the cost of the original game or make enough new content to make a new game. These "micro" transactions are making the developers bank and people are stupid enough to play into it.

DLC IS BULLSHIT PEOPLE. Easiest way for developers to do a minimal amount of work and screw you on cost. In the past it would have all been included in the original release. Now they're just breaking it up and selling it for more. |-|

PayDLC Features

CH-67 Huron - The CH-67 Huron is a twin-engine, tandem rotor heavy-lift helicopter. Its primary role is the transportation of troops, vehicles and cargo. The Huron exists in two variants. The armed variant includes two side gunners manning 6.5 mm gatling guns, while the transport version exchanges gunners for two additional passenger positions. 

Mi-290 Taru - The Mi-290 Taru is a heavy utility helicopter with coaxial rotors and a unique modular construction. Mission pods enable the Taru to serve a variety of different roles. It can transport cargo, troops, and provide battlefield supplies (ammunition, fuel, repair facilities, and medical equipment). The helicopter can also lift light vehicles thanks to its sling loading capabilities. 

Showcase Sling Loading - Explore the new Sling Loading feature and use your heavy transport helicopter to support NATO forces on Altis. 

Time Trials - Win the gold medal and set the record time in four exclusive helicopter Time Trials.

Platform Update (Free shit everyone got)

The Arma 3 Helicopters DLC is supported by a major Arma 3 platform update, featuring a wide variety of new content and features. The platform update is free for all owners of Arma 3.
Supporting Content

Support MP Mode - A new, sector control-inspired mode challenges players to transport units in and around the battlefield and provide logistical support by delivering supplies and executing medevac operations. 

VR Training - Four new courses that help you master the art of helicopter flight. 
Objects - A variety of new objects, ranging from landing platforms, to ropes and engine cranes, for Arma 3 content creators.
Supporting Features

Advanced Flight Model - Opt into the alternative flight dynamics powered by RotorLib for all official Arma 3 helicopters.
 
Sling Loading - Carry externally slung cargo under helicopters, and use the rope technology for other cool purposes. 

Firing from Vehicles - Use your personal weapons from specific passenger positions in a wide range of vehicles.

So two helicopters and timetrials and sling loading tutorial is bad DLC?

-Locks Vechichles from people who didn't purchase it (I believe they can go in passenger seats though)

-Locks Multiplayer server from people who dont have DLC? Nope

-Seperates the community? Nope

-Adds stuff for DLCless players? Yeah (a bunch of civilian helecopters which they forgot to add)

God why dont you bitch at them for the 5$ DLC only giving go-karts that was a april fools joke which they dontate a portion to charity?

One adds gokarts, and the other one adds two helicopters, one of which can be seen here. If you don't own the DLC, you can still be a passenger in the helicopters. The devs purposely made sure that no game experience would be lost by people who did not by the DLC.

|-| cnu8ltu || 37 || For people not familiar with Arma 3 let me explain how it works.  
The way helicopter DLC works is, there are two helicopters (Both large cargo helicopters, that can transport heavy-ish vehicles) you can get for $16. You will have the ability to use Pilot seat, co-pilot, and gunner seats. You will also have access to the advanced flight model (For people with joysticks, rudder pedals, etc), physics sling loading, and the ability to fire from vehicles.
Now BI (The devs) decided to allow all players to have the AFM, sling loading, and firing from vehicles for free. Regardless of whether or not they have the DLC.  
If you do not have the DLC, you can still be a passenger in the new helicopters. You can still pilot, or gun in any of the other 6 or 7 helicopters that are already in the game.  
The reason they did this is because  
A) Servers no longer need to seperate their player base and own a DLC, and Non-DLC server.  
B) Say you are playing with a friend who has the DLC, and you come across a DLC helicopter. He can fly, while you be the passenger (You can still use the Fire-From-Vehicle functionality in DLC choppers). No need to split friends up.  
C) Even if you do not own the DLC, you can still create servers and missions that use the DLC.

&amp;nbsp;

If you got Arma 3, you got Heli DLC for free. Those who didn't purchase HELI DLC are locked out of 2 helicopters...That's what you guys are crying over? If you want it that bad then spend the $15 and get your helicopters. I spent the $15 to support BIS, I want them to continue creating content and improving the Arma engine, which they are.  How do I know they're working hard?  I keep up with them on the BIS DEV forums, because they actually care about their community and release daily updates on what they're up to.  Here, look: http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?149636-Development-Branch-Changelog

&amp;nbsp;

I a world of shitty developers, BIS is one of the good ones.  If you don't know this by now then pull your head out of your ass and start reading material from the source rather than 3rd parties.

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the wording from BIS on the HELI DLC:

&gt;Arma 3 Helicopters DLC lifts off
Bohemia Interactive today released the Arma 3 Helicopters DLC – the second premium DLC for Arma 3. Featuring the highly detailed CH-67 Huron and Mi-290 Taru, the DLC adds new helicopters, the Sling Loading showcase scenario, and helicopter Time Trial challenges.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The CH-67 Huron is a twin-engine, tandem rotor heavy-lift helicopter. Its primary role is the transportation of troops, vehicles and cargo – and is available in both an armed and transport variant. The Mi-290 Taru is a heavy utility helicopter with coaxial rotors and a unique modular construction. Various mission pods enable the Taru to serve many different roles. It can transport cargo, troops, and provide battlefield supplies (ammunition, fuel, repair facilities, and medical equipment). Both helicopters are also capable of sling loading, which is a brand new feature in Arma 3 - and is further demonstrated in the premium Sling Loading showcase scenario. The Helicopters DLC also features four exclusive Time Trials, where helicopter pilots can show off their skills by winning the gold medal.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The Helicopters DLC is supported by a free Arma 3 platform update - released today alongside the Helicopters DLC. The 1.34 update includes the brand new Support multiplayer mode, where players need to provide various types of helicopter support – such as troop transport and medevac – in a Sector Control multiplayer scenario. In preparation of the new multiplayer mode, players can enroll in the brand new VR Training helicopter stages, and learn the ropes of rotary flight. In addition, Arma 3 content creators will be happy to learn that a variety of new in-game objects, ranging from landing platforms to military decorations and more, have also been added in the new update.
&amp;nbsp;
&gt;The Arma 3 platform update also introduces several major new features to Arma 3. For instance, players can now choose to enable the optional RotorLib helicopter flight model, which is an upgraded version of the flight model used in Bohemia Interactive’s Take On Helicopters, and provides an even more authentic helicopter flight experience. Furthermore, the platform update includes the aforementioned new ability to sling load cargo, which places a stronger emphasis on the importance of logistics on the battlefield. Last but certainly not least, the update implements the much-anticipated firing-from-vehicles feature - enabling passengers to engage targets while seated in a vehicle.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;“With this DLC, we've turned our attention towards enhancing helicopter flight, but there's much more to it than that alone. With our new features and content, combined arms gameplay in general has benefitted, and the Arma 3 platform is all the better for it!", said Jay Crowe, Creative Director on Arma 3.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;The Arma 3 Helicopters DLC is now available for 12.99 EUR/10.99 GBP/15.99 USD on Steam and Store.bistudio.com. People can save 25% by purchasing the Arma 3 DLC Bundle, which includes the Arma 3 Karts, Arma 3 Helicopters, and the upcoming Arma 3 Marksmen DLC, for 19.99 EUR/16.99 GBP/24.99 USD on Steam and Store.bistudio.com.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;*The Arma 3 Helicopters DLC is part of the Arma 3 DLC Bundle and Arma 3 Supporter’s Edition (Supporter’s Edition is no longer available for purchase). The Arma 3 Helicopters DLC is not included in the Arma 3 Digital Deluxe Edition. |-| 
|-| cnu9l1t || 5 || I can't tell if you're being facetious about this or not- but I really like Bohemia's DC model. You can play on servers that have the DLC enabled, you can still enter transportation birds (as non crew) and be carted around like the cheap dumb baby you are, and the DLCs (excepting Karts which was dirt cheap and mostly a joke but still really kind of fun) add plenty of content. 

The advanced flight model alone was well worth the $15 I spent on the expansion, if you're into that. Otherwise, you're paying for a few new birds and logistics features.

So if you're genuinely talking shit about this model, I think you're ill informed. If you're being facetious, haha, -2 for being vague. |-| 
|-| cnu9maa || 8 || You're either an Arma noob or an idiot. If you can't look past this simple, small DLC and enjoy the absolute **mass** of other content in the game, then you might as well stop playing.

Arma 3 has a ton of Helicopters in the vanilla game, a helicopter DLC was added for skilled pilots who wanted to have a greater range of abilities in multiplayer and milsim.  |-|

The accompanying platform update released at the same time added a helicopter flight model and other support features that allowed non-DLC players to use helicopters locally and online.  However, if you want to use the Huron or the Taru then you need the DLC.

So, it's still shitty, but in terms of what has been happening in other games its a lot less shitty. |-|

|-| cnucl3y || 17 || Fun Fact: You can still use the helicopter. 

See, the content downloads for everyone. If you don't pay for it you still get the improved helicopter mechanics and sling-loading system. 

But he can't use the helicopter! What's going on!?

Well, the way they set it up is that only players who purchased the DLC can *pilot the vehicles*. That player could still get in to the cargo spaces and otherwise interact with the helicopter. He can participate in missions that use the DLC and is not segregated out from players that have bought it. The player population is maintained. 

DLC sucks but ARMA is doing it better than most companies. 

TLDR; In order to prevent DLC from splitting the player community the DLC content is available to everyone. Only players who purchased the DLC can pilot the helicopters but anyone can ride along in a cargo seat. The DLC also includes significant improvements to game mechanics that are available free to all players.  |-| 
|-| cnucm1n || -3 || I don't buy games which do this. They are taking the piss when they sell a base game and then half a dozen overpriced DLC packages follow within 12 months. They understand that people are willing to pay more for several spread out purchases rather than a single, all in one expensive purchase. It is the consumers' acceptance of this sort of thing which is to blame. |-| 
|-| cnuco0e || 17 || This thread is amazing. The post itself is pretty popular, with 83% upvotes at a score of over 2k. And the first 5 top parent comment is bashing op on how this example is a good one DLC. 

Anyone care to explain why this happens? |-| 
|-| cnucoej || 6 || Since when were helicopters not included with Arma 3?  I seem to recall the free demo had them included.  

Or does the helicopters DLC just expand the variety of helicopters they have?  Because to be fair to Bohemia, they have one of the best helicopter simulations out there, second only to DCS. |-| 
|-| cnucowc || 8 || FYI, for those who haven't played, all this means is that you can't fly it. You can still be a passenger. That's like a million times better than most games. They also add actual high-quality content instead of stupid reskins.

The only game that's better about DLC is Europa Universalis. In that game, as long as the host has the DLC, everybody has it. |-|

|-| cnudj39 || 5 || Wasn't really all that scary, but it was amusing on account of how unforgivable the game is. Hell Dark Souls was nowhere near that bad.  |-| 
|-| cnudl4b || 4 || You can enter the vehicle as a passenger for free. And you can even crew it for a while for free. But it is part of the DLC package and if you decide not to buy it, it prompts you to buy the DLC. The other option would be to have DLC and non DLC servers, freezing out anyone who didn't buy the DLC.

So, if your complaint is that this allows DLC and non DLC owners to play together... I think you're barking up the wrong tree. THIS is the better option. |-|

|-| cnudxld || -3 || You dug your own graves. Now lie in it. 


But seriously stop supporting developers/publishers who do this, don't buy DLC unless you know it is worth buying, and stop pre ordering. This pre order culture is what leads to broken games getting sales( AC:U and MCC are good examples of this.)

|-| cnue2u1 || 115 || Oh boy, I love posts that only show half the story.

|-| cnue39k || 3 || I'm all okay with this kind of DLC. The game could be complete without this DLC but the developers chose to work to integrate the feature. They are not asking us to pay to play with those who bought it. They ask to pay if you want to use it. Would you work for free?  |-| 
|-| cnue3b9 || 7 || I don't understand why compelled people to attack the chicken and assume that there would be no consequences.  |-| 
|-| cnue3y6 || -4 || dat smokey yellow color tho |-| 
|-| cnue4zo || 13 || This is a stupid example. You can ride in the back of the helicopter and even be the gunner. You just can't pilot or be co-pilot. It's a much better solution than not letting you play on the game server at all. |-| 
|-| cnue56b || 3 || This is only 2 helicopters [out of all this](http://arma3.com/features/vehicles) not to mention countless numbers of high quality mods that is encouraged by the devs. 

This is the ONLY instance I woul argue for DLC. The gaming community as a whole has gone to shit and Arma 3 has it's problems. But the DLC strategy they set is not *really* one. |-|

|-| cnuecn5 || 4 || I really like these stores.  There are a few in my area.  Indie stores like these that sell games or stores that sell vinyl records are in a really great niche area.  Gamestop doesn't sell retro titles so that's a huge win and there is a lot of demand.  

Local store wanted $80 for Michael Jackson sega game.  Youtube footage of it is hilarious. |-|

|-| cnueg6l || -3 || ITT: arma fanboys making fanboy excuses. This game is literally unplayable in multiplayer without massive community "support". It's a developer's milsim sandbox confusingly marketed as a game. 

Expect to be met with disdain and criticism when wading into the "support" offered by the community while you figure out how to play. 

As someone who loves milsim, and really wanted to love A3, I am disappoint.

|-| cnuf002 || 4 || You cheeky monkey |-| 
|-| cnuf0lc || 6 || This is the last game to complain about in terms of DLC, really. Take something like Battlefield, they sell a few maps for $15 (or $50 Premium mode) and end up splitting the player base. So many other games do crap like that and it can be a pain for multiplayer, especially if you don't want to cough the cash.

BIS releases - as a *free* update to all players - the actual game improvements (fire from vehicles, RotorLib, etc.) at the same time as releasing an optional DLC, in this case a few helicopters. Yeah, $15 for a few helicopters is overpriced but I couldn't care less... they're completely optional, and offer little-to-no benefit over the existing helicopter options... simple solution is not to use them. If you're playing multiplayer, make sure the people you are playing with don't try to pick you up in a DLC chopper (which they probably wouldn't anyway).

I'm not saying it's great or I like it, but what I am saying is that it poses no real problem in game, unlike DLC mappacks and such in other games. |-|

|-| cnugbj4 || 15 || In Wii Sports Resort (or Club) there's a trick to it, thanks to the 1:1 motion upgrade. First you line up the bowling ball with the center pin straight on. (Make sure you have the manual controls set). Then you swing fast in a straight motion. Don't let go of B until a split-second after the ball is at maximum height. By releasing the ball, after the mii on the screen holds the ball still for a split-second, the game will still let the ball travel in a quick and straight line. This can easily be repeated and helped me achieve multiple perfect games in a row. If the pins are not cooperating, then aim a teeny tiny amount to the left or right, but still hitting the front pin.

I fell to the ground, on my knees with tears raining from my eyes, I vowed to never touch another cigarette. My Mother even begged me to stop smoking so that my family doesn't have to go through this pain ever again. 10 years later, I am now 27 and I haven't smoked a single cigarette since I made that vow. Looking back I regret not smoking for those 10 years, because this old piece of shit computer gave me cancer anyways﻿ |-|

|-| cnumj5x || 6 || I've noticed a lot of BN posts lately. I wonder why. |-| 
|-| cnumm4w || 5 || $60 for a game with the full maps, tons of vehicles, weapons, different modes, a single player campaign and scenarios. 

And then you pay $15 for a handful of helicopters. Seems to me that its quite a bit expensive for what you get. 

There are free mods that look and function just as good as these new addons, then why is it that this costs so much? Its not about paying for stuff, its about not letting developers nickle and dime you to death.

What more could a Korean gamer want?   |-| 
|-| cnuo9ez || 11 || Oh, you are so right. The DLC that everyone can use with the minor exception of being able to fly the helicopters by yourself. You can ride in them, you can place them in the editor and as Zeus, you can play with any server that has it.

Oh, and you actually CAN fly the TWO helicopters, if the mission has you start in it.

There is almost no requirement for you to buy the helicopter DLC unless you REALLY want two fly those two specific helicopters (Which no custom mission supports entirely so that people who don't own the DLC can play the mission), or if you want to support to the developers.

Oh, and let's not forget the huge improvements this DLC brought to the game, *for free*. This is an example of DLC done very well.

I mean, sure being able to get hold of classic N4 gamesand Sega stuff is awesome, but are they really going to make enough money to pay their bills?

Do they charge entry for those tournaments or something? Sell refreshments to the gamers? Or do they also sell new games? Or perhaps have paid memberships? Cause I can't see there being that much turnover in retro games and figures and stuff, that only collectors are really interested in.

|-| cnuxhm1 || 202 || **EDIT: Since everyone keep sperging about the framerate, [here](https://imgur.com/a/pm2nK) is proof that it is playable. I can't get a video as for some reason FRAPS crashes the game. Probably ENB interfering with it, as the d3d.dll file causes OBS and XSPLIT to not hook the games process and FRAPS likely uses a similar process to capture videos.**

This is the list of mods I used. They aren't in any particular order, so I bolded the ones that effect the graphical fidelity. The best mods are probably Qarls Texture Pack III (which replaces almost every single texture in the game with a higher res version) and the Oblivion Character Overhaul v2, which isn't so much a mod as a miracle. It fixes the "fucked up head" problem that the game has. 

The game may be a little too dark for some tastes, which comes from the ENB profile I used, which can be tweaked.

Artwork is cool and all. It's looks like they did a good job, but is a video game that important to get the characters permanently tattooed on your arm? Serious question btw. I just want to know the mindset. I'm not trying to come across as a dick, so I apologize if it seems that way. |-|

I also loved how they made sure you were fighting Nazis and not generic swastika-wearing Germans. This game wasn't afraid to show the cruel, racist, xenophobic, and even sexist parts of Nazi society. It made mowing down legions of SS soldiers more emotional and satisfying.

The first level also had this incredible air of dread over it. You know that no matter what the allies do in 1946, nothing will prevent the Nazis from taking over the world by 1960s. It makes the slaughter of all the allied soldiers feel even more pointless and sad.

Easily my favorite game of 2014. |-|

|-| cnvk78j || 15 || Hard fucking game with severe penalties for fucking up. Death was such a big deal and some quests were literally uncompletable if you messed up even once. It was brutal. Something many games lack these days. The quest system was incredibly innovative and something which is lacking in most modern day MMOs. Hell, I'll admit. When I was a child I would even follow walkthroughs to complete them as they were so increadibly complicated and difficult. There was so much fog of war going on and you could potentially jump down into a pit with no way out except death (losing all your hard earned gear and even critical, irreplacable quest requirement items). 

People also payed insanely good money for high level accounts and rare items (party hats anyone?). In the end I managed to sell my account off for £300. It was totally worth it in hindsight considering the direction the game took later down the line. Now it's lost it's charm and become ''modernised''. I don't care about stupid custscenes or high resolution graphics in a game which was ultimately about the mechanics and satisfaction of having your grind pay off. |-|

I played it for years back when it was 2D and then even more-so with my best friend when it hit 3D.... Jesus, I'd spend days just cutting wood to level up and make huge trails of fire to level up my firemaking. 

One particular thing etched in my head was the countless hours I spent running from the Camelot bank to the tailor house, constantly creating bowstrings and selling them... Jesus, I'm actually impressed my Elementary school self was able to do all the shit I did.

I even remember doing the fucking horrid, yet amazing underground pass. Had me on the edge of my seat &amp; then I also recall somehow finding tricks to killing bosses through objects so they couldn't hit you(halberd ftw). What finally made me quit was getting into World of Warcraft, just jumped from one addiction to another.

But we could just render them a different color to avoid confusion!"     I get to a so called "boss" and hes just a Draugr with a crown.  I get to the end of the mages guild quest, and have to fight these "ethereal beings" ... Just draugr's rendered in blue Wire Frame.  That pissed me off.   

We;ve got Dragons and Spiders and skeletons and all sorts of creatures, but there is not One unique Boss monster in any single dungeon anywhere in skyrim.   I would have loved to fight through a cave to find it inhabited by some epic beast like some 3 headed serpent or something but no.  Every dungeon is the exact same.  

Sometime between Oblivion and Skyrim, Bethesda went full convert to the religion of "we are a Corporation that happens to sell the product of Video games"; from more of a "we are Video Game makers who have formed into a corporation"     And the game completely suffers from the corporate culture. You can see in every cut corner and every piece of content that was not put into release because it couldnt be done by deadline..

Gone are the days when you would have a Video game release pushed back and pushed back Months because a piece of content was not ready for publishing. Now the content is scrapped because the deadline can not wait. The sales can not wait. It doesnt fit into the corporate structure and time table set out.  

And we get Shitty; LITTERALLY un finished games as a result.  The corporate culture that has pervaded Vid game producers over the past several years is the Sole reason the quality of content is falling to a pathetic state.  End rant. |-| 
|-| cnvtu8x || 10 || Educational institutions have different copyright laws applied to them, they are a little more relaxed. As such your professor's lecture slides don't even need to mention fair use or even Valve (also you could argue that Portal 2 is so iconic that everyone knows where it is from and therefore there is no need to reference).

Its like the developers are taunting you.  Plus, the whole 'I have a 80 pound sword, magic and can jump 10,000 feet in the air...but a locked door blocks my way.' |-|

As someone who was never allowed to own my own console until the Xbox 360 came out, that was the ultimate treat for me.  Since they didn't come with a memory card, I had to leave it on overnight and blast through a whole game in a weekend.  Aaah, memories. |-|

|-| cnxdpmx || 22 || I loved playing this game. I didn't really read or watching anything on this game before it came out, I just knew a new GTA was coming out and I was going to buy a PS2 when it came out, which is what I did. When I started playing it I learned that the main character's name was CJ. My name is CJ, so this was kind of a cool surprise. 

Every time somebody would say something along the lines of "c'mon CJ! Let's go get those naggers!" I'd get all excited and yell to my TV "Fuck yeah! We got this!". Unless it was that damn train mission...

Edit: The other cool thing is that I hated being in an intense duel with someone in, say Call of Duty, only to be denied satisfaction because someone killed someone else across the map. This mode gives you a defined time to finish the fight, but with added tension since respawning is out. 

I look forward to more great stuff in this franchise. |-|

|-| cnxhc6i || -3 || U ruined my life XD |-| 
|-| cnxhf9t || 49 || If I remember correctly, you don't start where you died. You start at the beginning of the world you died in. So if you die in world 4-2, you will start again in 4-1. That's more than 20 years ago though, my memory might be wrong.

Regenerating is actually worthwhile and the challenge requirments make you better at the game.  The parkour and pilot movement in general feels amazing.  A titanfall pilot could run circles around an exo.  The titans in general are just a blast to use and the game manages to strike an amazing balance between 2 completly different play styles.  

The best thing of course are the dedicated servers.  Ive played hundreds if not thosands of matches and every last one of them felt consistent.   |-|

It's like driving past an art museum at 95 miles per hour.  It sure does look pretty but hard to appreciate.

But it's a blast to play.  I just wish there was a longer game mode.  Or a hardcore mode so the play slows down a bit to appreciate the world's they've built. |-|

|-| cnxlcsd || 3 || By this logic it shouldn't count as win either if you join a winning game.  |-| 
|-| cnxlfhs || 6 || While this is great, an easier solution is just changing your views on winning and losing, as then it won't matter what system the game uses.

I take a kind of ancient warrior code view of the whole thing.

1. I have lost. (I am already dead)
2. I must win my victory (I must win back my life)

So as I enter every game assuming I have already lost, when I do lose it doesn't bother me.

While I've noticed no increase or decrease in my actual win rate after adopting this philosophy, I have noticed a complete elimination of rage quitting on my part.

This attitude also, for some reason, makes winning feel better. |-|

I am not sure if I will ever be able to carry my solo queue teams out of Bronze, but I'm always one of the top 2 players in the game, whether I'm in ranked playing with bronzies or going toe-to-toe with Gold and Diamond players in other modes.

|-| cnxm4tr || 24 || I recently got Titanfall and I've been preaching how awesome the freaking game is. Unbelievably well balanced, great and useful weapons, excellent map design, and little things like what OP just posted make it an awesome game.

|-| cnxmbib || 6 || It's an absolute shame, this game did SO much right and sadly, it is almost dead by now.

It was honestly the best mulitplayer shooter in years, the movement was tons of fun, the gunplay was very well done and the titans felt very balanced.

But their idea to divide the community with paid map-packs was probably what killed it in the end. The release of the first map pack saw a substantial decline in players across the normal modes and with every new release more people seemed to leave.
And this is regardless of the fact that they added a lot of stuff free of charge (new game modes, ranked play etc.). |-|

|-| cnxpb5d || 1478 || From the developers perspective, it's incredibly difficult to make any money in the mobile sector. Consumer's expect incredibly low prices for apps in part because of the standards set by Apple and Google. So what do they do? Resort to alternative sources of revenue instead of relying on selling a piece of software as a whole.

I remember reading an article about how Apple decided to encourage lower prices to basically ensure some piece of software doesn't become more important to the consumer than the hardware and ecosystem itself. It was posted in /r/gamedev or /r/androiddev but I don't have the patience at the moment to locate the link.

This happened already once with Microsoft Office, as for example for some of their customers it was more important that their computer runs this software than it is for their computer to be made by Apple. People were willing to switch hardware providers because of Microsoft Office. Now any startups are almost priced out of creating software at this level unless they resort to some creative pricing / revenue scheme.

**TDLR** If you don't like these freemium games, then most of us need to be willing to pay more for our apps. |-|

|-| cnxvryy || 44 || The freemium model on that game is actually really good. You can play up to 3 games at once. Then, once you hit 3 you just have to wait an hour to play another. You can play a new one every hour along with the ones you have going already. If you're away from the game for more than 3 hours you get three 3 fresh games when you come back. Right now I literally have 18 games going and it's still one new game every hour. The bonus games/microtransactions aren't invasive or doesn't change the game experience at all. This is one of the few apps that does it right, but still asks you to support the developers.  |-|

People put money and their time into creating this entertainment for you with the potential that they may never see a dime in return. Yet you complain that, in a free full game, you are upset that you have to pay for lives or wait 45 minutes for another free one.  |-| 
|-| cnxxm69 || 6 || "Why dont people give away their hard work for free!" |-| 
|-| cnxxm6i || 15 || Don't understand this mentality at all. Games have a right to make money. If you're not paying up-front, then stamina is a completely legitimate way to monetize. If it's not this its gonna be selling currency, or cosmetics, or be straight pay to win.

All in all stamina is one of the least abusive. I mean that is how arcades worked... xD |-| 
|-| cnxxmqf || 14 || Did you have to pay anything for the game? That's as much an honest question as it is potentially condescending and rhetorical. 

If you had to pay for this shit, then fuck these developers and anyone that looks like them. Period. 

That said, if the game was free, and you enjoyed playing it, and the ads weren't *unreasonably* intrusive...what exactly is the problem with the developers trying to generate some income for their efforts, which you clearly partake of and enjoy? 

I mean, generally speaking, if you *want* a plethora of free-to-play mobile games available at your beck and call at any time, you are going to have to accept either some level of intrusive advertisements (most ads are intrusive by their very nature, a fact people will have to accept unless they want Mountain Dew and Doritos to just happen to sponsor or feature prominently in every game) or pay-to-play/win mechanics.

|-| cnxyi4q || 12 || The thing that bothers me about this thread is not folks saying they don't like the freemium model, but that some of them seem to actually *hate* them. Not even just the games, but the people who make them. I know this is a widely held mindset, but goodness.

Yes, there are shitty games. Shitty games in all shapes in sizes, and plenty of freemium ones. Copies of games, poorly designed games, and games that are unreasonable with their IAP. But really, because there are shitty people trying to take advantage of the freemium model to excessively extort money you're going to demonize an entire industry? That's absurd.

Not every single company wants to eat your wallet. For a game to be successful, a great user acquisition department showing you facebook ads isn't usually going to be sufficient. Generally, if the game is in your hands, it's because it became popular and a lot of people enjoy it and play. Games *need* to be good in order to be incredibly successful, and unless you're a get-rich-quick-then-cash-out company you don't want to make your players hate you.

Finally, even the shitty extortionist games hardly deserve this reaction. What exactly have they done to you when you get to one of these "pay to get more lives" pages? Not one damn thing. You downloaded a bit of *free* software onto your device and played it. You got your money's worth before you even downloaded it. Don't want to pay? Well, fine, wait 45 minutes or stop playing. They don't owe you anything at this point, and in the case of this game all they're asking of you is to wait 45 minutes to play again.

As with most things in life that aren't forced upon you, if you don't like it then simply do not use it. But please don't disregard all freemium game developers as evil. A lot of folks in the freemium industry are out there trying to make great free games that people *want* to toss $0.99 at. There's a lot more to gain from happiness than anger.

I recently played the TMNT freemium mobile game recently. I was astounded that there is almost zero incentive to pay for anything. All you pay for is to not have to grind for another 30 minutes to get a few more gems and get better weapons and upgrades. I ended up buying a couple of packs of gems, just because I enjoyed the grinding so much that I felt obligated to give these folks something to show my appreciation. What a fucking horrible bunch of people for giving me a fantastic free game with an option to get gems faster for about the amount of money I make each time I visit the pisser at work, right? |-|

The invention of barbed wire was a total game changer seeing as how you can't effectively just 'blow it up.'

The notion that one of the most common and effective barriers between two points is like 95% air, if you stop to think about it, is novel. |-|

There's a free version that plays ads in-between games.  You can pay a little $ to get that off and then it's ok.  

But I had the annoying ad, it's some crappy mummy game and accidentally hit the buy button rather than the x to get out of it.  
They charged me $9.99 on my carriers bill on it.  No "are you sure" or "please verify this purchase", they just hit me with the bill.  

Some of you might think well that's not the games fault, it's the advertiser, but regardless, that company should be watching advertisers/developers like that and warning them that scam behavior won't be tolerated.   |-|

I can't imagine how it could have been so hard to include a bit of scripting that amounts to "when sneaking, SHUT THE FUCK UP."

(But then, I'd really like to see Bethesda improve the stealth game for FOIV or TESVI.  Things like kicking objects on the ground or a barking dog *should* tip off the enemy.  It would help balance out how overall easy the stealth-archer approach is.) |-| 
|-| cny3b8c || 45 || "Gee dad, when I grow up, I want to be just like Zorro."

"Haha, son, you can be what ever you want to be if you put your mind to it."

Suddenly, out of the alley comes a shadowy figure. 

"Give me your wallet," it says as it reveals a revolver. "Jewels, too."

"Thomas, I'm scared." Says the mother. 

"Don't worry sweetie, it'll be alright." The farther says to his trembling wife. 

As they hand the figure their money, the father trips, appearing to be attacking the mugger. In a panic, the father is shot. 

"Oh god, Thomas!" Cries the widow. Their son is speechless. 

The mugger quickly silences her with two rounds in the chest. 

"I love you, Bruce." Says his father, before shutting his eyes. 

Utterly dumbstruck, the small boy looks to the attacker as they flee the scene. The light shines on them for a brief moment, illuminating the chain link fence that murdered his parents. 

Years later, he fears none, not joker, not two face, not bane, none but the chain link fence.  |-|

1. Nobody wants to pay for games in the app store
2. Game developers wants to make money from their game

Nobody want's to pay for games anymore so developers need to do this sort of thing to make any money. I know because I'm a game developer :)

We made a limited free version of our game and a paid full version. It made us no money. Then we adopted the freemium model, removing our "lite" version and making the full version free but with in-app purchase. The difference in revenue was 10 fold. |-|

There is a segment in which you had to survive waves of enemies, and like in most games, the next wave doesn't come until you kill them all. Well their "intelligent AI" decided to hide from us in an obscure location which players cannot enter. It took all over grenades to be able to kill that fucker. I think that was what ruined that game for me, and after that mission it felt like a chore, waiting for more shit to happen. And It did, oh it did. Not to mention how horrible the controls felt. And the ending attempted to reinforce the idea of "They were in it for the money all along!!!1!". That was not his character, and you feel that specific character would not have done that. But they did it anyway, and you know what? Knowing that end game information ruined both army of twos for me. The legacy and nostalgia those games built up, were crushed. Smothered. Mashed like Potatoes. They could have gone about it countless different, superior ways, but they didn't. That game had some gall to call itself an army of two. That was the ridiculous, over the top, "Devils Cartel".

|-| cogwrvv || 3 || quick tip, if you get a new game (like even if its the day the game came out) and you really like it - Gamefly has a "keep it" option. You pay the price of a used game sale, usually like $10-15 off the list price. So, even though the game clearly is not actually in used condition (well I mean as in its clear you're the only one who played it), you get a good discount. And that gets compounded by the Gamefly Discount Bucks you get for being a member for awhile. You can an increased % off your sale, and every few months they throw you $5 off coupons. |-|

|-| cogfl7z || 727 || As one of the Steam backers, the only point at which the community became enraged was not because it was PM - but because they used the PC Steam platform to develop an iOS game, stripped a bunch of features and then even shat on their kickstarter promises/rewards. Even the thing about getting an intern to head the team and write the story now is just becoming unnecessarily provocative of the consumer base. 

I think that the smugness of responding to people's anger at him is what allows PM and his kin to pull this shit. On the Steam forums, two community managers have quit, the mods are barricaded behind ghost edits and the developers only drop in to pick their battles at rebutting overly-emotional statements.

But on Reddit, the attitude is markedly different. Godus was released on Kickstarter years ago, not recently, as such it was a time when things like FTL or other solid projects were in full swing. Having a go at someone just because you might have had better informed attitudes will only make sure that these stories of fraudulent behavior don't make it here on Reddit but are instead confined to Steam - which is what PM wants. 

The 22Cans forums are down. Emails are bouncing. They're locking down their hatches. There are really weird shills trying to turf the discussions. Reddit is being judgmental. PM is making paper money banks twenty-twenties.  

The only reason why he responded with a video and this became a thing is because RPS ran an article on it. Keep that in mind and let PM serve as an example to KS and Steam that this Early Access shit isn't working in its current way. You aren't going to change the masses of idiot casuals that are happy to buy 'gems' for $50 a pop - but you can support the change on platforms to actually start respecting consumer protections.

There's your first problem.

But for real, I enjoyed the hell out of Fable II, despite its flaws. |-| 
|-| cogmwnj || 8 || I see a lot of comments referring to kickstarter money as "investment."  IT'S NOT AN INVESTMENT. It's a donation. If you donate, you don't EXPECT to get anything back, but because you want to support an idea or a vision and want to see it realized. Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. If you get something from it, great. But, if you think if your donation as an investment or a preorder, you are doing it wrong. 

I'm not saying kickstarter scams don't exist and that those people aren't scum, but I am saying that a change in mindset would dramatically limit how successful they could be and how much it would hurt fin you got scammed. Donate, and just assume it's the same thing as lighting that money on fire. 

It's a fine balancing act between "buyer beware" and scam, but people are way to quick to cry scam when they could have easily protected themselves, especially by knowing what their kickstarter donation entitles them to, which is the right to give someone their money. That's it. Everything else is gravy. 

Nobody deserves to be scammed, but people need kickstart with their eyes open instead of their heads in the clouds.   |-|

|-| cogawwn || 21 || This is the entire problem with kickstarters in a nutshell. You're not putting your money in to get money back, you're basically giving charity to someone to work on a project and that if you pay enough, you'll get a bonus (presumably a copy of that project) if and when it is done. You're not investing, you're giving charity to people who have industry connections that indie developers could never attain.

Fable was supposed to feature real time world shaping, aging and population building. An open world RPG where each decision would effect every person and every action to follow. 

He basically described Dragon Age +kingdoms of amalar+world of warcraft and we got fucking Fable. A 6 hour, bare bones RPG on rails, where the only actual story altering decision was when you literally pick one of 2 endings before the credits roll.   |-|

|-| cogkle6 || 3 || Unfortunately Kickstarter and Amazon are not obligated to issue you a refund. I have had the pleasure of two projects failing to reach release and have just had to write them off as a loss.

What you do now is get VERY vocal about the issue and also make sure every time Molyneux mentions a new project you remind him and others of this failure/theft.  |-|

|-| cogtcgb || 3 || Kickstarter in itself is a website for donations. Not for sales of games. I think many people see it as another type of Steam or some shit for indie devs but really you're just donating for incentives. They don't owe you anything and if you fall into the trap it's your own fault really. 

Yes it sucks to be "scammed" but you did it yourself. You shouldn't expect a product or reward from a website dedicated to donations. |-| 
|-| cogtdpk || 3 || Finally someone brings light to this game, I funded the kickstarter as-well and its the only game that i will never play again. what convinced me was this video, probably about an hour long discussing the plans he had for Godus.

Cant believe I actually fell for this crap, it seemed like so much fun everything that he had in store for it and now its just nothing more than a glorified Iphone game.

Edit: there's a difference between a kickstarter failing and them not trying to make a game better. they had something amazing but they just decided to take the easy way out and make it an Iphone game

Molyneux has 'reputation' with the promises he makes, you should've taken that into account. Also, it's a Kickstarter, you willingly gave your money to something that didn't exist in the hopes of making it a thing. A refund would be stupid, that's not how crowd-funding works. You gave your money, the product got released, and while it might not have been what you wanted, it still got succesfully funded and released. |-| 
|-| cogytwq || 3 || OMG Peter Molyneux failed to deliver on a promise?!! MY WHOLE LIFE IS A LIE |-| 
|-| cogzcok || 3 || This is what you get for funding a Molyneux product.  Buying his stuff is like forgiving your girlfriend the fourth time she's cheated on you.   |-| 
|-| cogh7o4 || 21 || OP... Molyneux has done this since before you were born. That, or you have the IQ of a 10 year old. I have a rock that keeps tigers away I'm looking to sell if you're interested.  |-| 
|-| cog8wmn || 43 || You guys don't understand "investing" do you? |-| 
|-| cog8p2l || 25 || They should refund everyone who kickstarted - you can't just give up on a project and say "oh well" when that many people have supported you just because you're Peter Molyneux. 

The guy is a blight on the gaming industry. |-| 
|-| coguj3o || 5 || Have you stopped to consider that all of this is your fault?

I really mean it. You know how much this man over hypes shit. Yet you still decided to give him money for a game that didn't yet exist.

You're an idiot for not seeing this coming, and you're the reason he's going to do it again. |-| 
|-| cogaxlz || 4 || Heh, Molyneux has been doing this for decades, promising genre games blah blah whilst the gaming press have their noses so far up his arse they taste his breakfast before he does.

Sounds like he's taken his behaviour to the next level.

Sorry this happened to do but what did you expect backing this serial shyster? |-| 
|-| cogk3vt || 4 || I hope this teaches you and all you dummies out there, IT IS REALLY EASY TO GET SCAMMED BY USING KICKSTARTER |-| 
|-| cogxiyg || 4 || By now, I'm assuming there's been enough shitty kickstarters that Kickstarter has bolted down their ToS tight, and that the tl;dr version is: you won't get a penny.

Only back projects by people you trust, Kickstarter isn't a marketplace, it's a funding platform. You trusted a guy who clearly wasn't worthy of that trust. Sadly, that's on you. |-| 
|-| cogxmcw || 3 || Keep buying games that haven't been made yet, guys. Seriously. It's bound to work out eventually. |-| 
|-| cogb7uc || 6 || With all the failures and lack of promised features in Molyneux's past its surprising anyone still supports this retard. You have only yourselves to blame for either being blind fanboys or ignorant to Molyneux's history. You are PC gamers and should known better or have done the research |-| 
|-| cogdgs8 || 3 || Step 1: Tell gamers what they want to hear

Step 2: Pick up the money they throw at you

Step 3: Underdeliver and profit. 

Step 4: See step 1
 |-| 
|-| cogmk9d || 3 || Kickstarter is for suckers, especially for this guy who has literally never delivered on anything |-| 
|-| cogmlve || 3 || Seriously, who are you people that are giving money to strangers because they promise you something even though there are no consequences for breaking those promises. Seriously, fools and their money, yada yada. Same old tale of Carnies and Rubes. |-| 
|-| cogneja || 3 || did Reddit give the hug of death to RPS? anyone got a mirror? |-| 
|-| cogud03 || 3 || Peter Molyneux lied? Well there's a shocker! |-| 
|-| cogv97o || 3 || KONY 2012 |-| 
|-| cogyleo || 3 || Games.exe is not compatible with molyneux.dll |-| 
|-| cogamy3 || 5 || So?  This is part and parcel of game development.  If you throw your money into the ring you can't be surprised to see this, it happens to major publishers who have spent millions on R&amp;D - why would you be any different?  This is why I pay for completed games only, there is no reason get involved in funding games unless you have a fiduciary stake.    |-| 
|-| cogexj5 || 5 || &gt;Gave money to a website that guarantees nothing in return

&gt;is now upset


I don't mean to poke fun at you, but I don't like kickstarter for this very reason (thieves, liars, lazy people with a poor sense of integrity) and the easiest way to outright stop it is for us to walk away from the concept. |-| 
|-| cogom4n || 5 || You fucking retarded shit.

Look at his track record and ask yourself has he EVER delivered on what he promised?

If you say to yourself 'yes' you deserve to lose everything.

Doubly so for putting 'a lot of money' into a kickstarter.  You're not an investor, you have literally no rights. You've just handed them free money and they have no obligation to return it or use it in a manner you specify. |-| 
|-| cog94ww || 5 || Wait, this douche makes video games?

edit: disregard, lol.... I was thinking of a different guy
 |-| 
|-| cogtk2t || 3 || You didn't buy a game. You donated money towards the development of a fledgling game with no guarantee of a final product. You aren't entitled to any sort of refund. 

Get over it. |-| 
|-| cogxm2a || 3 || kickstarters do not guarantee that you get a finished product and your really arent entitled to anything, if you gambled your money its your own fault |-| 
|-| cog2pnh || 553 || The stealth/bow route is incredibly satisfying in this game. 

Quick warning: you gotta run like a bitch sometimes. If they know where you are you usually need to have some poisoned arrows, an enchanted longsword or a potion of invisibility.  |-| 
|-| coga37k || 86 || I envy the fact that you're playing this for the first time! All the things you will experience!  |-| 
|-| cog2tn7 || 126 || It killed me how little headshots mattered in that game (if at all? I cant remember). I loved "sniping" with the bow but getting that beautiful long-ranged stealth headshot was always bittersweet.
 |-| 
|-| cogid90 || 16 || Once you max out archery and stealth, you're an invisible sniper where most shots do critical and kill them instantly, sometimes flipping them through the air |-| 
|-| cog7oy1 || 25 || I went stealth/bow in my first playthrough too. Welcome to the easiest way to play this game. 

Shoot an arrow, run away. Shoot an arrow, run away.  |-| 
|-| cog3aug || 35 || OP IS CUPID CONFIRMED  |-| 
|-| cog8zy1 || 17 || I would gladly purchase a "shooter" where all I had was a bow and various specialty arrows and the Skyrim bow and arrow mechanics.  In any era of time/fantasy.  Take my money! |-| 
|-| cogao0t || 8 || I just recently did a playthrough with removing all crosshairs even sneak ones and doing pure archery, it was phenominally fun, if you're feeling adventurous or up for a challenge, I highly recommend it. |-| 
|-| cog631k || 8 || Yeah, it was nice. Got an alternate start and wildlife mods and off i went as a hunter in the middle of nowhere.
( Ran into a pack of wolves and got mauled 30s after game start).

Loved it. |-| 
|-| cog3fa4 || 11 || "Hey everybody, look at me! Who am I?... Saint Sebastian! Get it?" |-| 
|-| cog9r25 || 5 || Ah yes. The first time I fell in love with the game was similar. Never played an elder scrolls game before Skyrim. After I got a bow I was just walking around enjoying scenery and I see a bird flying through the air. In my head I'm like, "I wonder if you can shoot those down, I have enough arrows to try, let's give it a go." First fucking arrow brought it down, not only was I happy that it wasn't just for show, I was more shocked I was able to judge the arrows flight and hit the bird on the first go. I then proceeded to play the game for like a thousand hours. 

Side note, become a potion maker with your archery character.  That stuff is absolutely broken, poison and stun potions are awesome.  |-| 
|-| cog7qiz || 4 || Yeah but sadly arrows don't always stay where you shoot them. My favorite shot was when I hit a goat up the but with an arrow from about 100 yards away. Sadly after watching the slow motion kill shot the arrow immediately appeared sticking out of it's side |-| 
|-| cogbsqc || 3 || You'll shoot your eye out! |-| 
|-| cogbt6a || 3 || I miss the wonder I had when I first started playing it - amazing game. |-| 
|-| cogcmht || 3 || It's soooo much better with mods. |-| 
|-| cogk77t || 4 || My first time playing Skyrim I [collected buckets](http://imgur.com/uEMhYHJ) |-| 
|-| cogx4u6 || 3 || Shame you playing it on a console and won't ever experience 90% of a game. |-| 
|-| cog38mz || 6 || Just out of curiosity, but why have you not played Skyrim in the past?  |-| 
|-| cog4v3a || 4 || Quick question: has anyone actually gotten the Bleak Falls Barrow quest from the wizard in Whiterun? Because it just seems so hard to miss the guy in Riverwood who gives you the quest as soon as the game gets underway.  |-|

|-| cogu7sn || 53 || Thanks op, you just convinced me to not buy this game. |-| 
|-| cogrlmk || 24 || I despise this kind of stuff. Things like this should only be available through progression and leveling up.

It's very disheartening to see this.  |-| 
|-| cogqz3d || 34 || I'm more concerned that There's only 3 monsters in the base game. I'm worried it will grow old too fast. I hear they are making more monsters later but I'm sure it won't be free.

|-| cogv426 || 5 || Simple, don't buy, and move on. I've never bought extra DLC and I never plan to. Only thing close are legit expansion packs worth the money, but those days are gone.  |-| 
|-| cogvwe6 || 9 || Yeah, you know what?

In Fallout, you get a whole new area about 1/4 the size of the normal map to dick around in for $15.

In evolve, that gets you 6 skins. |-| 
|-| cogwfbr || 8 || It really bothers me when people say, "Well if you don't like it then don't buy/play/watch it." for games, movies, etc. that you are looking forward to playing/watching.

I just want to punch that guy in the mouth.

Fuck that guy and pre-planned DLC. How the fuck is it DLC if it is already on the disc? It is just as bad as those scammers that call old people and trick them into allowing them to remote into their PC and then the scammer locks it and demands $300 to unlock it. |-| 
|-| cogse93 || 4 || Other than not buying the game, what can we do as a community that will have an impact on the wat devs go about this whole DLC bullshit they've been pulling for the past year? We really need to pull together and do something that's going to cause a serious change  |-|

|-| cogrzoo || 25 || You guys are fucking idiots. Who cares if they are "only skin packs". They are still on the disc behind a fucking paywall at launch which is completely unethical. We are getting less and less content in full price games as time goes on when we should be getting more content. In 2005 games would have unlockable characters and skin's by accomplishing things within the game. In today's gaming that shit is gone, now you just have to pay for it. Fucking dumb |-| 
|-| cogv5ow || 8 || This is unacceptable.

As a PC gamer,  I am sick and tired of paying for a game,  only to get 1/3 of the content. While people do not consider optional cosmetics important,  look at the past games.  This notion that games are just the base,  and anything else are extra is really a new concept in gaming and it sucks for the consumer. You can blame games such as CoD and the people that bought them for that.

I'm not saying DLC is a bad thing, it keeps the money flowing to the developer/publisher. But have a released content rich game that's the best you can make, before you add additional content to buy.

Remember,  we vote for things that we pay for.  Vote with your wallet. Start voting no on this business model so we can see better games tomorrow. |-| 
|-| cogu0jv || 3 || woah what!  that is just daunting looking.  This is my anticipated game of the year and it looks more like a hobby kit than a free-time video game for fun.   |-| 
|-| cogunu3 || 3 || Aside from this game being an outrageous $60, day one DLC at these prices? Sorry, skipping this one.

This is a slap in the face that too many people will gladly pay for that publishers will not stop doing it. |-| 
|-| cogvkxh || 3 || I bought Dying Light instead of this, but really wanted it. I'm VERY glad I opted for DL. I will not be buying.  |-| 
|-| cogvl6l || 4 || Wow spending a couple of dollars for a red version of the 3 monsters? What a sale!! |-| 
|-| cogvohk || 3 || I don't think Ive ever bought DLC. |-| 
|-| cogvssb || 4 || I was still on the edge of getting Evolve. It's pretty fun in medium bursts, but it can get pretty same-y after a while.

I did the alpha and the betas, had fun.

But I think if they're going to charge 60 bucks for the game and then charge for so much other things, with so much of it pre-planned to release specifically to dole out the portions while asking for additional money over and over, I just don't want to be a part of it at all. |-| 
|-| cogw76f || 3 || This is fucking insane for a game that costs $80 AUD. |-| 
|-| cogxd0f || 4 || Do you know the definition of insanity? Doing the same fucking thing, over and over again, expecting shit to change. |-| 
|-| cogxr7x || 3 || The prices on those skin packs are stupidly high. It's an insult to gamers to suggest we're dumb enough to pay $7 for each palette swap. And we'll unfortunately prove how dumb we are when they make a killing off of this overpriced shit and get the inspiration to fuck us in the ass even harder next time. |-| 
|-| cogxwmc || 4 || I'm still getting it. Small DLCs like that bother me, but I just really enjoyed the game. Oh well. They still won't be getting any of my money on top of what I have already paid. |-| 
|-| cogyjvy || 3 || Give it 6 weeks, this game with be forgotten.  The cost of this game is mad. |-| 
|-| cogzlen || 3 || They are just skins, i can understand if its content like levels, monsters, weapons, but textures and skins... not a big deal. IMO |-| 
|-| cogowgr || 10 || Someone remind me to buy this when the GOTY goes on sale for $20 with DLC included. Until then, Smell Ya Later! |-| 
|-| coglw10 || 13 || ITT: Turtle Rock Studios employees |-| 
|-| cogvdew || 6 || Fuck this game.  Fuck it everywhere. |-| 
|-| cogmra6 || 7 || Hey, we're gonna SAVE, when we buy these. Hooray ! 😕 |-| 
|-| coglzha || 5 || I haven't bought DLC in years, this will not be an exception  |-| 
|-| cogpz0n || 4 || The problem with this is, the majority of consumers don't care. Maybe you and me care enough to not actually buy this game but the company don't give a shit about the small percentage who don't want to pay $100 to unlock everything a game has to offer. 

In a AAA title people still buy enough to be worth it. If we actually want a change we need to reach out to everyone who buys without thinking and that is not an easy task.

That's the worst part, I don't buy it because I don't support it but it has no impact unless others do the same. |-| 
|-| cogv55c || 4 || Season pass pretty much standard for most AAA titles on steam bioshock, borderlands you name it. And a bunch of skin packs for 7 bucks. You might aswell post league of legends shop which is remarkably more expensive and piss and moan about that too. |-| 
|-| cogw9sh || 4 || Honestly, cosmetic shit? Who gives a fuck? It's there for the people who really like the game and want to spend more money on it. Let them. It isn't for you and it doesn't make it a worse game. I play Elite: Dangerous. It does the exact same thing. Cosmetic skins for your ship for some extra cash on top of it being a $60 game.

The shit you SHOULD get upset about is when they sell all that pay to win bullshit. EA has already been doing this forever since BF3. Let you unlock the guns with cash. THAT'S bullshit. This, not so much.

I'll be downvoted, idc. No one has shown me anything gross about Evolve so far. |-| 
|-| cogusgf || 6 || Well shit. I *was* looking forward to buying this game a lot. Now they can piss off. |-| 
|-| cogwt3j || 3 || Nope, you lost me at DLC. |-| 
|-| cogx32m || 4 || What's the fuss here? I see skin packs for sale and nothing that changes the gameplay. Personally I'm against pay to win and I'm not seeing it in that screenshot.

Is the game playable in its basic state? e.g. not buggy, polished gameplay.  |-| 
|-| cogw968 || 3 || " omg a new ip that looks fun! Sweet! " big annoucement that reveals that this game will be the best to put dlc and makes the player need to read a chart to see which platform gets which dlc with which season pass and and which packages. They literraly killed the game before it even came out. Good job. |-| 
|-| cogohrq || 3 || I'm not a dude that normally doesn't buy a game because of the DLC, but that's fucking ridiculous. I thought I was looking at a free to play app! |-| 
|-| cogg790 || 8 || I think as long as it's just customization it's not that bad. Not to say that they could have just included it in the game to give the players some sort of customization options, but otherwise everyone has to decide for themselves if they want to buy that kind of stuff. |-| 
|-| cogg5ae || 3 || I have no idea how to play evolve and only watched some videos, but 8/9 of the DLCs are skin packs, so probably nothing that can influence the gameplay directly. I for myself am fine for those things to be sold seperately from the game, no one is forced to buy these to get the full experience.  
The Season pass on the other hand is a complete ripoff if it is like a season pass in CoD etc, you get a part of the game that was pre-planned and not implemented only because that way you have to pay even more money just to get the whole game. |-| 
|-| cogg78j || -9 || Almost everyone of these are skins, not extra content that was cut from the game for a day 1 DLC.  And the one that is not a skin is a  season pass for future DLC. |-| 
|-| cogh6lx || -18 || Or...we just stop complaining about micro-transactions that in no way effect the overall gameplay/story of a game.

If they were selling individual missions, stronger weapons/armor, or even maps individually then it would be different. All I see with Evolve is skin packs, so who cares?

Is it really going to ruin your gaming experience because the developers are making you pay to make your monster pink instead of just giving it to you? It doesn't effect how good the game will be, and no one is making you buy it, so why is there so much complaining about it? |-| 
|-| coggtdh || -8 || ITT: A bunch of entitled ass gamers who expect free shit for no reason.

Its cosmetic, has no bearing on the game, and costed money to make, but somehow you all deserve it for free. |-| 
|-| cogpbe5 || -5 || Who cares? They are skin packs... |-| 
|-| coghicm || -4 || Its only skins though  |-| 
|-| cogpsgu || -3 || Seriously though, they are all just skins. Buying or not buying will have no effect on the game play. I find this type of DLC to be the right kind. It's like if I buy a custom back for my laptop. I don't need it for performance, but if I want to shell out the money for something that I think looks cool then I will buy it. Otherwise what is the harm of having it out there for someone else who is willing to pay money for it.
It is only when they start selling DLC that will give huge advantages  to those who buy them (god tier weapons day 1) that DLC is broken, but that is not the case here.

TL;DR be happy it is just skins and not "pay to win" perks. |-| 
|-| cogu2bt || -3 || All right, I realize that my opinion is in the minority in this thread, but I don't see what the big deal is. Compare EVOLVE's base-level release content with that of Left 4 Dead (chosen because of its similar structure), and what we've got is a game with at *least* as much content that is fairly well balanced from what I've seen in the "Alpha" and "Beta" runs.

Content is not free. If they were not selling these skins, they almost certainly would not have been made, especially right at launch. *I* don't think much, if any, of the cosmetic stuff they're selling is worth it, so here's what I'm doing about that: **I'm not buying it**. If other people want to throw money at that stuff, more power to them.

On top of all that, Turtle Rock has committed to releasing the most game-affecting content, namely new maps, for free. Literally 100% of players will be getting them. |-| 
|-| cogfxwf || -3 || This game was announced with a DLC leak. Don't buy it.  |-| 
|-| coghjur || -4 || To be fair, all of those are skins.  So if you want to pay for swag all the power to you.  |-| 
|-| cogjwq2 || -3 || Hold on a minute. Are those... are those skin packs? DLC that is purely cosmetic and doesn't give any one player an edge over another? Stuff that allows the companies to make money without making players feel like the rest of the game is being held ransom?

I'm scared... |-| 
|-| cogp2lz || -3 || its vanity skins i dont know what the problem is
feed me your downvotes |-| 
|-| coghjpr || -3 || I hate that I was excited about this game when it first showed up, I was planning on buying it after watching gameplay videos, and now I want the developer to go bankrupt.

And it's not just skins you're buying, the game is on sale for 60-100 bucks for 12-16 hunters and 3-4 monsters. |-| 
|-| cogkmuo || -3 || This is a terrible warning sign, when they release cut content as day 1dlc for additional money. |-| 
|-| cogtava || -3 || What is the problem with paid dlc when it doesn't impact your enjoyment of the game.  You bought a full $60 game and you got just that. Having a different colored gun that you have the choice to buy shouldn't impact how you perceive the value of a game |-| 
|-| cogjwws || -5 || entitled shitbags who think all games they play should be 100% free. These are purely cosmetic, same shit as League of Legend skins. Why dont you go try complaining over there. |-| 
|-| cogj4qt || -5 || OH NO NOT *GASP* SKIN PACKS!!! 

If it really bothers you stop playing video games, go sell all of your games, your consoles and find a different hobby. I hear reading is a good hobby to pick up, most of you could benefit from that. |-| 
|-| cogm4bz || -4 || ITT: People have no idea what the hell a skin pack is. |-| 
|-| cogxjcu || -3 || We've come to the age where you all need to accept this and be FUCKING GLAD THEY AREN'T LOCKING MECHANICS AND STRENGTHS BEHIND PAY WALLS. When you buy a car, you have an option of adding shit to it to either make it look prettier or add convenience. No one fucking complains about that. But because you drop $60 dollars you feel entitled to have EVERYTHING about a game. I think what is shown in the image is reasonable. If dumb motherfuckers are willing to pay for COSMETICS that give no conceivable benefit at all to play style or abilities, then let them. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY THE COSMETICS. STOP FUCKING COMPLAINING. You are all on a fucking hatetrain because you want to be. 

"WAAAAHH They won't give me the special pink monster as part of my initial sale, WAAHHHHH but I waaaaant ittt" 

Go fuck yourself. |-| 
|-| cogx8md || -4 || Seriously? People are hating on this game because of some overpriced cosmetic content? You are totally missing out. The base game is fucking awesome, surpassing almost every triple A status game content that came out in the last few months. You don't have to buy anything, because of the amount of content the base game has. Missing out on a monster? Who cares? You can still play with everyone else while you dont have said monster. Plus you have acces to three fucking awesome monsters.

No in depth story? Ever thought that maybe the developers didn't want to focus too much on the story but more on game mechanics? For multiplayer games like these, gameplay is more important than storytelling (it has a nice story though). There are a lot of multiplayer games out there with much weaker story then Evolve.

7 dollars for some skins? Is that too much? I know a certain game that asks almost 30 dollars for a single fucking skin. Where was the hate then? League of Legends has one of the most overpriced cosmetic bullshit that I know of atm. People still play it. WHY? Because the game is still good for most people. They don't buy cosmetic stuff, or overpriced champions with real money. They just play the game as it is and enjoy every moment of it.

Why let an awesome game pass that brings the co-op multiplayer genre back to life with one of the most thrilling cat and mouse elements ever in games (bonus: I loved the AC: Brotherhood multiplayer) for some overpriced cosmetic stuff? The game is so fucking good at it's core. ITS JUST COSMETIC STUFF. 

15$ for a new monster. It's a little on the expensive side. I'm with you on that. But it's not that you have to buy it to play this game. They will probably balance every new monster and hunter so that there are no pay to wins. I'd rather buy a 15$ monster then a 15$ champion in a moba game that will be nerfraped a week later, and where the community makes you more musclecringe then mustardgas.

Super ranter away! |-|

First of all it's one of the easiest and most simple things to get "good" at, simply because it's limitations are based on the programming. All you have to do is figure out what works best and then keep doing it.  
  
Who would be really even proud of saying "yeah, I'm a world class gamer". Okay, so what have you even achieved that will help you in the real world? Why is this becoming accepted as a meaningful "profession". You're not adding anything to the world, you're just playing a videogame. Fuckin nerds.

Seriously though, I am approaching this game with all the caution in the world, especially after the botched 2014 when it came to releasing games. Sure, this could be fun. But so far it looks like a mediocre linear shooter with shiny graphics. There's too many questions surrounding this title.

I know that many would consider Morrowind to be their favourite (with good reason I'll admit) but Daggerfall was always my favourite.

|-| cogqit8 || 3 || Oblivion was my favorite but I was disappointed I did not hear [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeo3ISj8DaQ) after being pardoned. |-| 
|-| cogu947 || 3 || That Daggerfall screenshot has always bothered me because it appeared on the box but features a bunch of stuff that wasn't in the actual game. |-| 
|-| cogzfm5 || 3 || "You can wear armor and plain clothing at the same time" -Morrowwind. This is a common sense idea that should be brought back to rpg. 

Could make for great combinations. |-| 
|-| cogtj51 || 5 || Why did you used a reaaally low resolution for the Oblivion one? That was and is still my favorite game of all. |-| 
|-| cogr5sz || -3 || You forgot ESO. |-| 
|-| cog0zaz || 37 || It is also an impressively realist behavior... |-| 
|-| cog1dws || 24 || It's very smart seeing as people do that all the time.  |-|

|-| cogtc1q || 9 || Goodnight, sweet prince. |-| 
|-| coguqy1 || 7 || What!? I'd fix it! If you don't feel like fixin it you can always send it my way :p I'd even post repair progress to reddit |-| 
|-| cogu9zl || 5 || I have one of these with an awesome game called Golden Sun. Unfortunately, I lost the cord. It sits in a plastic bag waiting for me to one day revive it so we can be together again. 

My condolences.  |-| 
|-| cogtn8u || 3 || A system only dies when it is forgotten |-| 
|-| cogwrav || 4 || That thing looks very used. I'm fairly certain I have one in my closet. PM me and I will send it to you so you can get the use out of it that I never did.

Edit: if you live in the United States :p |-| 
|-| cogtch7 || 4 || I'm sorry for your loss. I'm sure it lived a good life.  |-| 
|-| cog24i5 || 12 || I love the hell out of SimCity. I'm a little heartbroken with where it's gone in the last installment. Maxis made some kick ass games.

*edit: a word* |-| 
|-| cog4f65 || 4 || This post makes me sad because this version is miles ahead of the new POS that just came out.  |-| 
|-| cogb6t9 || 4 || The thread title reminds me of the text from interacting with a random bit of scenery in an old RPG.

"The original Sim City. Where it all began. Wonder if it still works?"

...and then the question just left open because there's no way to interact with the object further. |-| 
|-| cog4vs6 || -3 || Sadly, those discs will no longer work as the magnetic tape in them was of such poor quality that it's not archival and will degrade after only a few short years of disuse. |-| 
|-| cog3kuz || -5 || &gt;Wonder is it still works?

No, it certainly doesn't work any more. Unless he got it protected against Y2K, you're just looking at some nostalgia inducing coasters now. |-| 
|-| cogs6az || 8 || You dirty rebel scum!!! |-| 
|-| cogsmh7 || 3 || I feel a disturbance.  |-| 
|-| cogt1or || 3 || It's an adorable little AT-AT. |-|
