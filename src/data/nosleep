|-| cnuim8k || 7 || Okay, "Angel of Death". You have to realize that humanity was born sick into the world. We were damned as soon as we walked the Earth. Our story had been written, long before we ever came into being. Yes, you take life, but in return, it is you who gives life as well. You are Oroboros. There can not be a world without darkness, for the light to shine, and without light, darkness could have never balanced. It was a lonely creature who only needed a companion. Now you come, threaten to devoid Earth of our sins? Is it not that very "God" that gave us the free will to sin? Is it not not he same "God" that wrote our story not so a millineia? You breath into us thy breath of life, and take away when you feel threaten with our might. Did we choose to corrupt this oasis of freedom? No. As I said, we were born sick. Entities like you look down upon us with weary eyes, but when you commit vase amounts of genocide for your so called cause of "ridding the earth of darkness and evil", does that not make you no better than we? You think yourself higher than us, when in fact, we are just like you. You kill, you take, and you corrupt, Angel of Death. You watch us, but have you taken moments to look at yourself? 

There cannot be good, where there is evil.
And there cannot be darkness, where there is light.

I am watching YOU, angel. We all are. Take our lives if you will, we will just began again for free will is omniscient. |-|

My older brother would babysit me, he'd then point behind me while it was quiet and with fear in his eyes tell me she was standing behind me.. I would scream like a girl and run to my room and lock the door.. where he would proceed to change his voice and shout "mis hijos" and tap on the door.. this happened many a time..
Well one day as a early teenager I went to the wax museum in Tijuana Mexico, (I'm from San Diego with family across the border) there's was a bunch "horror" figures in one section Dracula, Frankenstein, etc. Well as I walked in and looked around that room I didn't think twice until I turned around to her wax figure extended finger painted right at me.. the childhood fear surged through my veins.. I was out of there in a heartbeat.. 
If I recall there's a Supernatural episode about this legend..
I was recently down in Tijuana for Christmas, I think they're having a whole month dedicated to her at the wax museum.. try your luck finding her there OP. |-|

The next thing I'm going to say might make you more disappointed.
If you checked your email early enough, Judy was in the room that Taylor was in already. Do you think that she would have still been alive? Maybe she would have gotten to a hospital and could have been saved. Also, if her injuries were that bad, I'm going to estimate a 30/70 % survival. I'm no doctor. But I hope you don't blame anything on yourself like a lot of other people would do.

|-| cnum6ig || 6 || How'd OP write this if they're dead? |-| 
|-| cnumbvi || 6 || So I'm from central Texas, born and raised, in small towns, and I have taken interest in LA llorona,  I have heard wailing and crying out by the river, I have friends that have heard it, I have family that have heard it, they all have story's and every single one was heard by more than one person. SOMETHING is making the sound, that much is apparent, it happens maybe twice a year, random dates, it moves upriver mostly,walking pace maybe, very loud, can be heard from pretty far away, times vary, once was in the morning as the sun was coming up, once was at 5 in the afternoon and into the night, the river runs through to town at parts so I assume it isn't constantly yelling, but when we heard it it was for about ten to fifteen minutes before we left,  it has been heard at different spots on the river, and in different rivers, that's most of what I know so far, I've always wanted to solve the mystery I've got a lot of story's as well, I've asked a lot of people about this, some were obviously fake and some were obviously real. Does anyone reading this have any real stories? If you do describe the sound  |-| 
|-| cnumocg || 4 || I'm from Phoenix as well (born and raised) and the fact that you saw her by a canal really freaks me out! I have always lived right by canals. 

Also, your version of the La Llorona story is very interesting. I never heard that one before. I am of both Mexican and Apache descent. The story I grew up hearing was that La Llorona already had two kids when she met a rich man. She fell in love with him but he did not want to be with her because of her kids, so she drowned them in the nearby river. Afterwards, the nobleman found out what she did and was horrified. He alerted the authorities and La Llorona realized what she did and drowned herself in the river. Now, she haunts bodies of water through the south west United States as well as Mexico searching for her lost children. Some say she was condemned by God to roam the earth for eternity looking for her kids. 
It's a very interesting story. My grandma has always told me that she heard La Llorona when she first had my uncle. Crazy stuff. But there are many versions to the story :)

Seriously though, leave her alone. Don't even think about searching for her.  |-| 
|-| cnumqsj || 7 || I'm from Mexican background &amp; My mom &amp; my grandma always told me the story of La llorana. your version was way different. The story they told was about a women who had four kids, and her husband left her, and she grew so angry, she drowned all her kids, but later regretted it. I know she screams out, "ay mis hijos" (oh my children). I hope you don't see her again!  |-|

|-| cnuojb2 || 3 || Maybe I'm a bit biased but from what my grandma has told me and what I've experienced myself, Mexican ghosts aren't like most American ghosts. With American ghosts you can do paranormal research and poke and prodd and unless you are dealing with something demonic you are ok. 

Mexican ghosts will fuck you up. Do not acknowledge them, do not try to find out what makes them tick. You run and you pretend it never happened. It took a lot of nagging to get my grandma to fall me anything about these kinds of things and I really wish she hadn't. These are not nice ghosts |-|

I haven't done any of the things that this story says (which I haven't fully read yet) and thanks to those that warned me about this.

There are others. Spirits who simply exist through one's actions. Compassion, Humor, Rigor, Justice, and many others. These are the human spirits. The Angels and Demons want to pretend that they can hold power over mankind, but the truth is that we are more powerful than they could ever be. God tried to destroy the world with water. We can end all life with fire in only a moment. The Devil tempted us with knowledge. We made learning obsolete. Humans grew up fearing God and The Devil but in the end they are the ones who should fear us.  |-|

Not only will you be off the hook for previously finding him and failing to notify anyone, but you'll be seen as a hero for finding these other kids as well.

|-| cnvbqmx || 6 || They're gonna be looking for Jared wasting valuable police force, you COULD theoretically stage his death, but then you would need a body because he would be a murder victim and in the autopsy they would discover he is not your true son. Staging finding him like another user said is possibly smarter, but still has its risks. I think the best course of action is to lay low for awhile, tell your son there are people that want to take him away from you because of what you did to the man. Be honest with him, its crucial. After a few months of you both laying out of the way, i suggest half a year, and the case of your sons kidnapping runs cold, then you pack up and leave the state. With the excuse that you've run out of hope of ever finding your child and you can't bear to live in the town anymore. 

By the way, who else thinks the 'kidnapper' is the boys real father? Close to impossible since he must've been taken at a young age by OP, but still plausible if he has an older sibling that looks like him. |-|

|-| cnvd57n || 3 || You could always just wait a few days and say that Jared found his way home.  Or say that you went back to the park to look for him, and found him there. (Why do I get the feeling that OP has staged Jared's death before...) |-|

 |-| 
|-| cnvgb38 || 18 || Wanna find out?

The main thing right now is there's a spirit in contact with your sister. Somehow. So do a quiet test. What's your faith? Christian? Mine is Pagan, so til you respond and we can figure out a purification ritual for whatever you have faith in, try this. I've done some research, I'll make this as broad as possible.

In almost every religeon that has contact with it, white sage smoke is considered a purifying thing. Go get yourself a smudge stick. Clean the entire house. Just say you felt like you should do something great for your parents lately as they're under a lot of stress, and scrub that sucker top to bottom. Put every single little thing away. This is martha stewart levels of clean. The more you shift and clean, the more the ... it's almost like it changes the electromagnetics of the house or something. It makes it harder for the thing to move throught the house. Work from farthest from your sister's room in. Do yours first. Clean it all. Get your parent's rooms. Clean the closets. Pull out the dishes from the cabinets and wipe them down. Clean the fridge. You're going to spend days on this and you'll be picking up after your family compulsively. It's going to dtrive you insane, but the more you do (right down to the guts of the toaster and the inside of the microwave) the better off you are. if you can wipe it all down with rosemary and sea salt as you go, the better. (stick the rosemary and salt in water, add heat, then take a moment to add what ever sort of attention you can to it be it prayer, meditation or a poem you like about casting shit out, go til it's smelly and you "feel" like it's done. Don't know when to stop? 7m? More?)

Rearrange the furniture or at least scoot it around if you can. You want this house to feel dissimilar to what it was before.

Ready to chase this out? Open all your windows. Find a poem that moves you about purifying or claiming or dispelling some sort of entity and yes I'm being vauge on purpose. If you find something that moves you, it'll work better because you'll care more. Open all the drawers, open all the doors, open the cabinets to the toilets to the drains. If you can open it, open it. Light that smudge stick, let the bits start to coal and blow the flame out. Keep blowing for more smoke if you need it, but it spreads ash. This is where order is important. You're making areas that, at least temporarily, the thing can't get into. You need to work it towards your sister's room. Close it off, one cabinet at a time. I usually start in the kitchen because there's so fucking many cabinets. Blow the smoke into everything. light switches, light fixtures, outlets all need smoke. The drains need smoke. Picture sealing the area and the holes in the house's "natural defenses" of drywall. Blow smoke into the drawers, the cabinets. You wouldn't normally blow the smoke, but hey, you've got something you know is nasty in there, so don't be afraid to use the smoke. Yes, it'll probably smell when people get home. It'll smell good, if it's any consulation. Play it out like a stratagy game, shooing things out windows and shutting them behind you. You want to make sure nothing can get back in. Either repeat the poem the whole time if it helps you focus, or say it on each room. When you get to your sister's room, shut the bloody door behind you or it'll try to get out that way. Walk around the room and saturate the smoke. Blow it on her clothes so it won't even like being near her. Yes, you will likely want to get everyone's clothes. Sorry. The important part is to get all of it. It's like a christian house blessing in a lot of ways. Shoo the spirit out the window and shut and LOCK that sucker behind you. Do you have a holy sign? I'm good with an Atom if you're an atheist. Make the gesture over every window as you close it. Every door as you shut it, all the drains and outlets, the light fixtures. You're going to feel silly.

That should clear out most things. The more OCD the better. If she's pyschic, just do the same thing to your room and yourself and that'll... just be fun. XD Sorry dude.  |-|

|-| cnvlawj || 4 || I had the same thing happen to me when I was younger than her and it's still going on to this day, your sister's a Medium and they're spirits that are talking to her. Don't be all "gurrr spirits aren't real," and shit, or else it'll close her off even more. She needs someone who respects what she can do, and *will* need someone to talk to when she's older, whether it's you, moral support, or a skilled Medium that can help her. I speak from personal experience. :) |-|

|-| cnvo69x || 5 || Holy fuck this is awesome. Mental illness is not something to fuck around with. I have major depression, general anxiety, adhd, and some slight obsessive behaviors, it's something I struggle with every single day. No one understands the implications of their words or actions when condemning people with mental issues. |-| 
|-| cnvo6n9 || 3 || This is unbearably sad. I'm so sorry for OP's suffering, no one should have to feel so utterly alone and helpless. If Kyle was a doctor, perhaps he was the only kind one and your mind latched onto that as a last resort. Either way, I hope you're at peace now. It's not mad to wish for better hallucinations.  |-| 
|-| cnvojlt || 3 || Hey, are all those bones yours from other staged murders?

You should just haul ass with Jared and become another missing person yourself. You seem pretty wise about building an identity in town already, I'm sure you can make another together with Jared.

Staging his death or anything requiring his participation would be traumatic and questionable when he grows up anyway. |-|

|-| cnvr081 || 3 || I am surprised that your memories of your "other life" did not fade the longer you were in your current life.  This will not be the only time you relive your life and you cannot ever force it to happen the same way.  But you can recognize the causation behind the things you liked about your life and the things you wish you had changed.   Sometimes this affords you the perspective to see the things you think were mistakes such as having a child in HS you realize were actually wonderful experiences that helped mold who you were.   It is always the most vivid the first time.  I will provide you a short story of my own.  Once I had a life where not so good events happened to me.  Through those events I met a woman whom I fell in love with.  I had never known love like I had with her before or since.  I believe she was my soul mate.  Her family saw to it that our relationship was ended.  Since that lifetime I have met her several times and tried to reestablish what we had but it never has worked (probably because I am trying to make it work  and it is not happening naturally).  I have never found another soul mate and I am burdened with the memory of what I once had.  I have never told this to anyone for fear they would think I was crazy. |-| 
|-| cnvrmfm || 3 || Why didn't you give it to the police?
Might solve a cold case. |-| 
|-| cnvrtgv || 3 || You're not a good father, you're not his father at all. You kidnapped Jared yourself and took him away from his real family without his or their consent. Mother and real father are out there somewhere probably missing him to death. You're lying to him and everyone else and probably that banker you hurt was his real dad. You've got no right whatsoever and deserve to be caught. How do you justify this to yourself? Do you think that just because you're lonely you can steal someone else's baby? It doesn't work that way.  |-| 
|-| cnvrulz || 6 || Yep. That poor girls family will never get closure. You "noped the fuck out" when you should have manned the fuck up. |-|

|-| cnvsrma || -5 || Okay |-| 
|-| cnvszz7 || 3 || It sounds like you might not have travel through time, per-se, but "jumped realities" or "jumped universes". You see, in Cosmology (the study of the universe) and Theoretical Physics there is a controversial  theory about there being an infinite number of universes with all possible permutations of history being played put, one per universe. Said theory is commonly called "The Multiverse Theory" , or just "The Multiverse" (Wikipedia link here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse).

This is just me guessing, but it sounds like somewhere some wires got crossed, and you ended up "here", in our little slice of the pie. While I can't really help in any meaningful way to get you home (my sincerest apologies), I hope this helps you understand what possibly happened. I also hope that this could spark some fellow Redditers into some ideas into how to get you back to your husband and children. |-|

|-| cnxhk1q || 6 || Listen... Everybody has their own "demons". Nobody is spared... 
By hating those who hurt you, you are becoming exactly the same as them. Unfortunately, you're no better than them. I understand it is fairly difficult to fight those demons inside us and to endure suffering. But, if you don't want to be miserable, please start changing - step by step. First, go see a good psychologist, because you desperately need something that will help you fight off the depression - it's treatable. Once on proper meds, start changing your life, looking for people who will make you happy, trying slowly to make others happy as well. Start slowly, try rebuilding your life. Go talk to your friends, people who care about you. You will see, you will start smiling more and you will start enjoying simple and small things in life. I know this sounds too simplified, but you have to start from something. If you need any help, you can send me a message, you can talk to me if you wish. You just have to have the will for a change. At least you can try. I wish you all the best. Please take care. |-| 
|-| cnxi3d1 || 4 || I would call,  and make sure that logan got mentioned in your info to the police,  hopefully he was not part of it,  but one can not be too careful about a thing like this... Be safe and secure op!  |-|

After this, smudge your house. "Smudging" is the burning of sage to purify the house and get rid of "bad spirits". 


Do not try to speak to it again, do not try to contact it. If your parents will believe you, sit them down and tell them about it. If they won't, wait until they have an experience and quietly explain what's going on, then drop the subject.


Number one thing to do in this situation: Do not try to speak to it again. Communication with it only gives it power, seriously. Don't try to speak with it via the board again. |-|

Happy hunting.

Love it even though it is for the most part sadly true. But Arkansas has some damn good drugs.

As far as never seeing your uncle as an abuser meth is a terrible terrible thing that can turn people into monsters. It sounds like he is clean now which is a great accomplishment. But you may be right to question if it was his mind. Its possible that 2 people did show up that she left with, it is also just as possible that the fact that they had foil on their heads was a sort of hallucination. Foil is commonly used to smoke dope. But maybe I'm grasping at straws trying to blame the meth.  |-|

i think you should do the right thing and make out of your finger bones a necklace to ward off evil in the future.also,don't bang hot chicks anymore.or,y'know,abstain from alcohol |-| 
|-| co94n42 || -5 || So if I may ask, and I'm sure it's been asked at *least* once already...

How did you type this??? |-| 
|-| co9c4np || -5 || Sounds like you got what you had coming to you. From the sound of it she really didn't want to have anything to do with you romantically but you pushed from day one. Them's the breaks, eh. |-| 
|-| co92t9p || -13 || Wait, so you had to post this because you probably couldn't get to a computer. Yet, this is being documented and posted supposedly after you've had therapy sessions and police search through your room. You must have had access to a computer between then and now somehow. And you have a smartphone. Couldn't you have posted this with that?

Anyway, never minding the somewhat apparent logical error, I hope you figure out what's going on as safely as possible. Can you hire a private investigator? |-| 
|-| co9b959 || -8 || Are these /r/nosleep posts real?   |-| 
|-| co9c54s || -4 || Just wondering, how did u type this w/o your fingers?  |-| 
|-| co91wxc || -14 || Must have taken a while to type this post :p |-| 
|-| co91fpd || -6 || This happened to you too? We've been looking for a girl named Amy who did this to me last year. |-|

|-| co9je91 || 7 || I'm starting to believe this little shit is psychopathic.
Probably killed his parents, grandma, anyone who pissed him off.
 |-|

|-| co9nh96 || 3 || FINALLY she believes him! It was honestly getting on my nerves the way she denied everything. How do you expect your child to be open with you when every time they tell you something you refuse to listen? |-|

|-| co9fdzq || 13 || See, this shit right here is why I sleep hidden underneath the covers, cocooned in pretend safety.  |-| 
|-| co98btf || 9 || Good luck, OP! Please, let us know what happens? Im sincerely worried for you |-| 
|-| co9bd1j || 7 || Holy shit that's one of the scariest things I've ever heard and now I'm going to be freaked out all night. Very interested to see what comes of this.  |-| 
|-| co9jgkl || 8 || So, what's the website? |-| 
|-| co9feds || 4 || Well. Looks like I'm unplugging my phone charger and covering all of the windows tonight. And putting the mirror down just because. |-| 
|-| co9kdgq || 4 || whats the website...? |-| 
|-| co9d65f || 3 || I wonder why whoever is taking the photographs gave you the URL to see? Or maybe it is an anonymous tip off from someone that knew? Whatever it is, be safe OP &amp; update us.  |-| 
|-| co9i3qu || 3 || Link? |-| 
|-| co9i811 || 3 || Thank god I sleep with a 110 pound pit bull
 |-| 
|-| co9dx5x || 5 || Link to website or...? |-| 
|-| co9fetx || 83 || You need to properly arm yourself. Fuck salt, it does nothing but increase blood pressure.
Step 1: Buy a dog.
Step 2: Buy a gun.
Step 3: Tie the gun to the dog (or if you have a small breed tie the dog to the gun.)
Now you have created the ultimate weapon. The dog will have the balls and the moxy to detect the ghost as it arrives and the fire power to stop it. What you lack is courage and also bullets. The dog will have the tools that you lack to dispatch your ghostly intruder.

Nothing beats the gun dog combo. |-| 
|-| co9nwas || 11 || Have you considered investing in curtains? |-| 
|-| co9eacf || 8 || Do you mind me asking where you are OP?  I had the impression your apartment was in NYC but you said you just woke up, and this was posted around 9:00pm EST.   |-| 
|-| co9gra3 || 6 || At least you had salt protecting your apartment! You're lucky he didn't go downstairs to the lobby, since it was unprotected. I suggest you have friends sleep over tonight. How are you going to explain this to maintenance? Please keep us updated cause you've definitely pissed this thing off!! |-| 
|-| co9j1wx || 3 || Sounds like you're dealing with a Leviathan. Just based on the description of it's mouth. Salt wouldn't work for that. Stay safe OP!!!  |-| 
|-| co9ia6s || 3 || So we've established that the man isn't a demon, because otherwise the salt would keep him out. So on the plus side, you're not dealing with some paranormal shit OP. 
The only other alternative, is a demented maniac, and that's certainly more terrifying. 
You need to figure out HOW he gets in. For starters, go to your roof and look down, if there's building floor above you maybe he climbs down. 
Also. 10/10 would recommend buying a gun and shooting it.
On the plus side, hey you just found the plot to write for your next novel!!!  |-| 
|-| co9n1nr || 3 || Hi OP! Buy yourself a small webcam or security cam you can point from the bed to the balcony, along with things like a gun, ammo, etc, whatever would make you feel comfortable. The camera will serve a couple of purposes: You can watch the feed the morning after to make sure you're not insane, show your friends for proof, explain a random gunshot in the middle of the night and potentially a dead body. 

As for the smashed window? Should've gone with an earlier comments advice and bought a curtain whilst you could! I would recommend going in to set up the camera and leaving immediately, only coming back the next day to view the feed. 

The obvious thing in my mind in that this entity will not be/want to be/able to be viewed by the camera. In which case, have a slumber party, bud. 

For now? Go and have a drink and stay at a friends house, write a journal of these events as they happen! For the love of god do this! Go back to the apartment and check the salt lines! How do you know the entity got *in* to the apartment? How do you know the salt didn't stop him? If the line is broken, it didn't work. If not, you have hope. 

He wasn't angry at the salt, I don't think. He just wants back into his apartment. Possibly he is a former owner, killed himself on the balcony and wants our etc.. Try talking? I don't know. 

Steps to follow for simplicity's sake:
0) DO THIS NOW! Buy a journal! And use it! 
1) buy a gun 
2) buy a webcam/security feed
3) hook up said webcam/security feed 
4) check salt
5) get the fuck out and find a friend 
6) get support however you can, only go back in the day

GOOD LUCK OP.  |-| 
|-| co9nqd8 || 3 ||  Couple of things: 
1) Offer an olive branch and leave out an ashtray. 
2) Fuck salt, get some holy water and load up a super soaker.
3)Research your building...im sure you will find some sort of history that may explain whatever is happening. 

 |-| 
|-| co9orrh || -4 || Alright, I'm sorry buddy but this can't possibly be real. You're either a psychopath writer who's standing outside of someone's balcony and describing the situation as if you were the person inside... or you're bullshitting everyone on this sub. Why don't you get a weapon of mass desutruction (a knife/bat/gun) and ask him what he wants, get real. |-| 
|-| co9d4s9 || 38 || I had trouble seeing what I was supposed to in your picture, so I took it into GIMP and played around with the contrast levels before cropping. For anyone like me who can't see it, here's the eerie, edited version: http://i.imgur.com/rET8sQc.png |-| 
|-| co9dzbc || 17 || Fuck that thing... You should buy a gun. Also maybe get a dog  so you'll be warned if someone tries to enter your house. Nothing beats the gun dog combo.  |-| 
|-| co9gr70 || 19 || This look just like that nigga in the old scuba-gear who chased Scooby-Doo and the gang up out the beach or something. |-| 
|-| co9chwi || 5 || Well I will never sleep again  |-| 
|-| co9gumz || 4 || Goodness, that picture! I would get rid of the house too. Please tell us how you acquired the house. I am sure this has to be associated with the unfortunate death you wrote about.  |-| 
|-| co9k962 || 4 || -freaks the the fuck out-

I feel bad for the poor fucker who gets that house next. &gt;.&gt; |-| 
|-| co9nuyb || 4 || Sooo... You say you have a house for sale. Cheap. PM me |-| 
|-| co9g8ld || 3 || Oh man. I got chills when i saw that picture! If something like that happened to me, I wouldn't ever sleep again....... |-| 
|-| co9ltlv || 3 || Your cat has balls of steel. |-| 
|-| co9ae4c || 9 || Have you been to any sleepovers since OP? |-| 
|-| co9ecsb || 7 || Well, that's terrifying.

For some reason it made me remember the movie May. *shudders* |-| 
|-| co9kdi9 || 3 || What the Fuck did I just read? |-| 
|-| co9g9ap || 3 || I hope you hunted that bitch down and tortured her! Then anonymously called the police. Please update with more of the story!! |-| 
|-| co97r43 || 13 || Wow, dude. be careful. you might want to think about putting a piece of tape over your front camera, since it seems that shes watching you through there. Beyond that though, i dont know what else to tell you. Maybe burn some sage and stuff like that just in case its a spiritual thing? |-| 
|-| co9ddft || 11 || Jenny I got your number 867-53099999 |-|

|-| co9h06d || 3 || Your friends don't even know where you work? Jeez. |-| 
|-| co8wx9u || 12 || Oh, shit, you live in my city. I went out yesterday and saw everyone staring one way and the first part of your story immediately occurred to me, so I looked away and walked as far away as possible. I can meet you at the mansion, and I can wear a blindfold so I don't look at you, just so you have a companion. Would that work? Worse case scenario I forget about you, hop on nosleep later and remember again.  |-| 
|-| co8t0ye || 4 || Wait who are you? |-| 
|-| co8tzqv || 5 || you know, it would seem you are experiencing or perhaps generating a perception altering phenomena. regardless of your intents, it would be interesting to see the ways this effect can be altered. as an example, is it based just on line of sight or identifying you in addition to sight. even if you don't cover your face, lets say you pretend to be another person and wear a wig and clothing you wouldn't normally wear, do you think this would have an effect if they cannot identify you as yourself. if its line of sight, you covering your face appeared to be enough to break the effect (albeit with different effect of identity/memory loss). 

first i would suggest a few tests if you like, perhaps they can aid in any event that may hinder your plans.

1.  try to use a different identity and see if this breaks the effect. 

2. test to see if your semi-identity is recovered if you reapply a face covering such as the (blanket?) in your last log

3. in addition, how is information deleted per se when you are forgotten. perhaps try a mask then give someone a note saying something like "hello this is everyonelooking, how are you?" then remove your mask and reapply it. see if they can read the info if it has your name in it. maybe the information itself will delete. 

4. wear a mask and hand people an image of you and see if the effect still is apparent

5. does this effect animals or other things that can observe you? if so try a camera or video perhaps.

there are possible ideas i have as to what could be causing this, but in the mean time, good luck

|-| co9288b || 3 || Well, damn. This is hardcore shit. I have one thing to say: What would be the purpose of killing innocent people? (Kin Jun Un, that's okay, duh) But what about people that don't know? They're innocent. Your mother loved you. She didn't do anything. It's not her fault you have this 'effect' or whatever. What makes it anyone elses?  |-| 
|-| co93g0r || 3 || What if you met a blind person? |-| 
|-| co94tne || 9 || Rex reminds me of Cerberus. That must be why you keep saying "He's mean as Hell," emphasis on 'Hell' |-| 
|-| co9dvl6 || 6 || It sounds like whatever it is is loyal and protective... Not everything supernatural is evil. |-| 
|-| co9a3go || 7 || It's probably a goat man dog; they've been known to impersonate regular dogs or goat dogs. |-| 
|-| co9l27g || 3 || idk, I'd keep it.
Seems loyal enough to be your friend, but it also seems like something that would kill you if you turned on him.

just my opinion.

|-| co9hl96 || 3 || Man, I can completely relate to this story. I have anxiety problems, sleep problems, and occasional hypnogogic episodes, though their usually as I'm waking up in the morning. |-| 
|-| co95dmb || 6 || Wow.. Hardcore, man. I remember my friend telling me a similar story of getting phone calls worldwide of just people saying 'Goodbye' and crying on end. It wouldn't stop. It happened for around maybe six months before it stopped completely.  |-|
