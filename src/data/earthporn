|-| cnu2x5m || 4 || Me and my family visited Cornwall while visiting relatives in England, it's one of the most beautiful places I've ever been, if you can deal with the unpredictable weather. One minute it'll be scorching and the next it'll be total downpour. Overall though I'd recommend it to anyone, a fair number of castles to visit too! |-| 
|-| cnu30ua || 17 || You uh.... colorized the tree green. |-| 
|-| cnu8g51 || 3 || I love this place, check out the villages bordering it if you can. |-| 
|-| cnubeu6 || 9 || LOL that tree is obviously a brush, which is why you can see through it, and the grass is over-saturated.

*The tree wasn't edited at all, it was literally just placed there as a photoshop brush. Anybody who's seen PS brushes will notice it almost immediately.

Welp, here's proof: http://i.imgur.com/ZS6B0hr.jpg A wonder what brushes can do in one minute.

Oh wait, I forgot terrible shadows under the trees, hold on.. http://i.imgur.com/zITRfZG.jpg

|-| cnuka1u || 5 || I'm from Arkansas and I visit this area every spring and fall! Very beautiful! |-| 
|-| cnukrab || 3 || Awesome, did you hike to the eye of the needle as well?  It's further up the hollow and quite possibly one of the most incredible places in Arkansas.

If you like waterfalls, check out https://www.waterfalls.io  I'm a developer who also happens to love waterfall hunting!  I'm going to be adding a lot more waterfalls from Arkansas over the next week and will then be doing an official launch of the site on my Waterfall Group page on Facebook here pretty soon.  

Thanks for sharing man! |-|

|-| cnxrpe6 || 4 || I took this photo in the early morning. The river was so foggy but I decided to wait until the sun came up just in case the fog dissipated a bit. About 5 minutes after I first saw light, the sun rose above the fog and filled the valley with light over the river. Usually I would have left after looking at the fog, but waiting paid off big time. |-|

|-| cogacpg || 122 || In the *state* of Hawaii, yes... but not on Hawai'i (the big island).  This is the north coast of Kauai for those interested.  Very beautiful!  Numerous movies were filmed in the region. |-| 
|-| cogbf9d || 9 || There is an 11 mile trail from the north side that leads to that beach in the center; Kalalau. It is very rugged, sees tremendous amounts of rainfall, and has some crazy elevation changes, which help make it one of the most dangerous trails in the United States. People die every year in flash floods because they start seeing rushing water in every gully, panic, and try to ford every crossing just to escape but end up being swept down a cliff. I hiked it without a raincloud for 4 days, but my friend hiked it in December and was trapped in Kalalau for almost a week. By the time the rain ceased, sections of the trail had eroded and they had to be helecoptered out.

Poor guy. The last time he hiked Kalalau, he broke an ankle coming down that big red hill before the beach. He had to pay Alakai the pirate of Kalalau like 100 bucks to take him back to Hanalei on his jetski. Cheap compared to a medivac helecopter though.

That whole archipelago is crazy. |-|

|-| cog9v7u || 12 || We did a commercial boat cruise along the Na Pali Coast and a pod of spinner dolphins found us and gave a show.  The boat captain said he had never seen as many all at once.  He estimated 500 dolphins!  

After stopping the boat engines, we put the kids on board along the bow of the boat.  Most hung their feet over the edge.  Not only were the dolphins jumping and spinning all around us, but they came right up to our boat with their pups to show their young our young. 

It was one of the most amazing experiences of my lifetime. |-| 
|-| cogfy6r || 7 || I've hiked the length of the Kalalau twice now as well as a few day trips to showcase the beauty of the region to less accomplished hikers. Every single time the noisy helicopters took away from what would otherwise be a serene nature experience. 

If you are considering taking a helicopter ride here, please do not. The best way to see it (and earn a healthy sense of accomplishment) is to hike it.  |-| 
|-| cogoit8 || 4 || I hiked the trail about 2 years ago and took this shot: http://i.imgur.com/itzWHgq.jpg

You can see the vantage point from where I took my shot in your photo. The sloping hillside just beyond the beach.

We camped out on that beach for 2 nights. Such an amazing experience |-|

Some pics from my Napli excursion. We hiked in 11 miles and hiked out the following morning.

First, pic is from the just past the first beach. That's a boat at the bottom.

Second, pic is from the drive up Waimea Canyon road.

Third, is from the beach about 2 miles in from the start... Yes, my ancestors are mermaids.  |-|

|-| cogll99 || 3 || I've kayaked it (an all day kayak trip from early morning, you won't be able to move your arms the next day), boated it, and hiked the first part of it on Kalalau Trail and then turned inward towards Hanakapei water fall. One of the most amazing experiences I've ever taken part in. |-| 
|-| cogdhq0 || 3 || Skip the chopper and do the hike. Hiked the trail to [Kalalau Beach](http://i.imgur.com/xRXpJnY.jpg) two years ago. Be careful of [Mile 7](http://i.imgur.com/VLJ4dap.jpg)


 |-| 
|-| cogfpo7 || 3 || Fun Fact: The locals don't like the helicopter tours on the island due to the noise pollution. I hiked this coast (Kalalau) last March. 22 miles of lovely switchbacks that provided stunning views at every turn. It's was incredible! If you have questions on the hike feel free to ask.  |-|

|-| cog90yz || 4 || You know why it is so green, it's the 5 meters of rain that falls per year, it's not uncommon for 12 inchs of rain to fall in 24 hours when the tropical express is directed like a fire hose. It's a local joke that there are 20 words for rain because they see so much. Misting, spotting, fresh, light-medium-heavy showers, solid, sheeting, pouring, bouncing(when there is 1/2 inch of standing water and the rain makes splashes 6 inch's high), roaring, Storm force, Gale force( when the rain is going side-way's above 110 km/hr). |-|
