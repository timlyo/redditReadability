I go outside, scoop the bunny into a bag and deposited in the garbage.  She went out to finish and comes in 10 minutes later demanding to know what I did with the bunny.  I just told her I took care of it and wanted to know why she was questioning me.  She tells me to look out front.  I stepped out and sitting there proud as could be is my 25+ year old cat with a bunny at his feet.  I went over to the can and looked in, sure enough that bunny was still wrapped up in there.  So I explained to my mom that was another rabbit, I took care of it and finished the lawn for her.  I don't think she's mowed a lawn since, that was 20+ years ago. |-|

You have to realize that there's a chance it will NOT work out, and you could lose her completely. I took that chance and never regret it. 

In the end, looks are just looks and it's the person that matters. From your story it seems like you guys make each other a better person, and if you have the resources to get her back from India with you, I'd say go for it. Although that is easier said than done I guess. |-|

|-| cnu6umi || 3 || &gt; Will the Affected Limb of a Child With a Growth Plate Injury Still Grow?
&gt; 
&gt; Most growth plate fractures heal without any lasting effect. Whether an arrest of growth occurs depends on the treatment provided, and the following factors, in descending order of importance:
&gt; 
&gt; Severity of the injury. If the injury causes the blood supply to the epiphysis to be cut off, growth can be stunted. If the growth plate is shifted, shattered, or crushed, the growth plate may close prematurely, forming a bony bridge or “bar.” The risk of growth arrest is higher in this setting. An open injury in which the skin is broken carries the risk of infection, which could destroy the growth plate.

&gt; Age of the child. In a younger child, the bones have a great deal of growing to do; therefore, growth arrest can be more serious, and closer surveillance is needed. It is also true, however, that younger bones have a greater ability to heal.

&gt; Which growth plate is injured. Some growth plates, such as those in the region of the knee, are more involved in extensive bone growth than others.
&gt; Type of fracture. Of the six fracture types described earlier, types IV, V, and VI are the most serious.

&gt; The most frequent complication of a growth plate fracture is premature arrest of bone growth. The affected bone grows less than it would have without the injury, and the resulting limb could be shorter than the opposite, uninjured limb. If only part of the growth plate is injured, growth may be lopsided and the limb may become crooked.
&gt; 
&gt; Growth plate injuries at the knee have the greatest risk of complications. Nerve and blood vessel damage occurs most frequently there. Injuries to the knee have a much higher incidence of premature growth arrest and crooked growth.

&gt;I desperately, desperately, want to. I want to be the guy that makes her life great and amazing, that her life didn’t end because of the acid attack.


If that's not a declaration of love, then I really don't know what is.


&gt; She says it will be the saddest and happiest day for her.

DUDE! She loves you too!!!!!!!


This is only TIFU if you end up regretting the choice you make. Chose wisely and let us know how it goes (I think it would be wise to chose the love you have over the mystery of what you might get).

|-| cnu8gsp || 57 || I think white guilt has turned the word "racism" into something it's not.  You made the assumption that the probably Korean nail parlor lady was a Japanese waitress.  Then you realized it was a fuck-up.  That's not being racist.  Worst case scenario it's some form of laziness.  If you were actually racist you'd internally loathe these japanese and korean [insert pejorative term]'s for taking over your town as you bite into a delicious piece of sushi, and you wouldn't give the smoking nail parlor lady the time of day.  Or you'd boycott their business altogether.
  
  I'm not saying you didn't *come off* as racist to the lady, but it's not like told her "you all look the same fuck you go back where you came from!!"

a lot of people due to distance (my case :(  :(  ) or clash of personalities don't spend much any quality time with parents... its nice that you are able to and enjoy each other's company too :) |-| 
|-| cnu8koq || 17 || I had a pretty lengthy conversation with the local police about having ammunition shipped to my office (totally legal and a great way to satisfy the need for a signature for daytime deliveries when I'm not home, but not the most normal thing, so they were concerned), and it just so happened to be the day that I was getting to ready to go hunting and had my bow with me- in the office, because my car had been broken into recently and I was nervous about leaving expensive things in there.

I know that gut-sinking feeling of "oh, crap, I fucked up and now people probably think I'm dangerous and violent."

For the record, I'm still fully employed, etc, etc. No lasting damages. |-|

I was once madly in love with a woman.  She had run into trouble and needed a place to crash so I obliged as I would with any friend I trusted.  I loved her so much but feared she would have nothing to do with me.  We lived together off and on for 3 years.  I finally professed my love to her but to no avail.  She was still getting over some douchebag that mistreated her.  We hooked up a few months ago and all was well.  I then moved to a place where she and I could not be together for 3 months.  We had a huge fight about it.  At the end of the 3 months I found a place of my own and was going to call her the friday before christmas 2014 to tell her the news and to invite her to my office christmas party.  As I was pulling up her number to call, my good friend (a mutual friend between her and i) called me.  He informed me that the only woman that ever truly understood me, had committed suicide.  I'm not saying Swati will ever reach the point of taking her own life, but what if something happens?  What if there's no tomorrow...
   
Do not wait or be scared.  You absolutely MUST tell her now.  You do not want this pain.  The pain of not knowing what could have been.  The pain of being alone.... completely.  The worst Swati can do is say no.  (I highly doubt she will say anything other than yes).  You need to fly to India and tell her in person.  I beg of you, do this.  I couldn't save mine, but hopefully you can save yours... |-|

|-| cnua00o || 9 || well, its clear that you care for her very much.  its less clear if its more of the brother type love or if its romantic love... and its hard to know how things might go once you'd be living in the same city together.


I think based on what you wrote that you should probably tell her how you feel... I know that risks hurting her if things don't work out in the end... but somehow it seems important that she knows what you're thinking/feeling...


also I think that its important that you spend time in the same place for a bit so you can both get a better understanding of how your interact in person... I know that you've spent time in India, but because of your hesitation, it seems that you need a bit more time there...


idk if you're able to take a longer vacation there, or if your workplace does any work/consulting there, but if there could be a way to do that, it would be ideal...


but whatever you do, do something to better explore this, so you don't regret later not having found out if it might be possible to work


(my cautiousness is from having had a long-term long-distance relationship that wound up being horrible once we lived together, but I think that my case is more the exception...) |-|

Even if she says no, be there for her. Be her friend that she needs and deserves. Maybe talk about an living community or something, that you'll find a job for her or at least helping her find a job in USA.

All this things, say that face to face to her. It's the best that you can do, it's more personal than write this to her in WhatsApp or talking on the phone with her. Please let us know what happened! |-|

|-| cnuauvd || 26 || As an Indian, I can only imagine the stress she will be under in India. As much as I want you to go for her, I will tell you the following. 
1. You are here in the US and she is in India. Daily life in the US is a lot easier than that in India and even worse for an acid burn victim. The state of mind you are in on a regular basis is much better than hers.
2. Even though both of you are happy and looking forward to talking to each other every day right now, keep in mind that you don't live with her now. Meaning you don't get to take part in her daily struggles beyond phone calls.
3. Life with an acid  burn victim is no easy thing. There is a lot of emotional, mental and physical struggle for you and her.
4. If the relationship does not work out *knocks on wood*, it will be a lot more difficult for her to come out of it than it will be for you.

Think this through completely before you take the next step. But whatever you decide know that you need to plan a life where she is a part of it even if she is not your life partner. I hope it is love that you feel and I hope things turn out well for the both of you. |-|

|-| cnubg31 || 18 || Mentally accept it as a good thing. The old rings were symbolic of the relationship you had, the new ones can represent the new relationship.  If you think of it as a fresh start and a new opportunity it gets better. You can't unsell the rings but you can change your thoughts about it. My (now wife) broke up way back when we were just dating and rekindled several years later. When we got back together,we both decided to throw away the gifts from the previous relationship (including jewelry). It was mentally refreshing to lose the baggage of the past.  |-| 
|-| cnubn44 || 4 || so basically you want her to have a nice life and whether you end up with her or not i think being close to her is important for you and her. if you have the money and the means to get her citizenship then you'll do it because love or no love, you care for her. help her.   
  
the real kicker is that it's obvious you love her too, the romantic hangups will be there but right now you don't have to worry about a relationship or marriage, you love her, you care for her, go for it. by it i mean you should make the effort to be closer to her, don't worry about romance. it's weird to say but love is above all of that.   
  
you don't have to be her significant other, you can still be that person in her life that helps. don't say you don't know if you genuinely love her just because you can't immediately imagine marrying her. you love her, brah. go get your loved one, bring her home, keep her close. |-|

|-| cnuet92 || 125 || It could be worse. The summer before my junior year in college, I went to Chicago to spend the day with a girl I hadn't met in-person before. We got set up by our pastors who knew we were both looking for a partner. After trading emails and texts, I took a train to downtown Chicago and met up with her.

We had a great time, went out for sushi, went to an art museum, had a really terrific walk along the Michigan lake bay. Everything was fine until the end. I wasn't used to the metro. We got stuck shuffling back to the train station in the evening, and I suddenly realized I had to pee. Like *bad*. It snuck up on me out of nowhere.

I finally had to tell her "Hey, I really need to go to the bathroom." She was like "Well, we're 3 stops away from getting off. Can you hold it?"

I tried my best, but as soon as we got off the last stop, I walked crotch-first into one of the metal turnstyles. Her metro card ran out of funds right after she went through. I hit that sucker so hard that I thought I was going to die. It felt like somebody poured liquid metal into my belly.

She ran off to refill her card, and I just stood there trying not to throw up. She came back and got me through. But as we were walking up to ground-level, my bladder just gave out. It was like a lightbulb going.

I peed all over myself. She was so shocked she couldn't even move at first. Then she threw her hands up and started going "Oh, oh, oh!" I grabbed a newspaper off the floor and held it over me. I gave her my wallet and told her to go buy a pair of pants, from *anywhere.* She ran off and came back after 15 excruciating minutes with a pair of "I love Chicago" sweatpants.

We went out for a year after that. She thought it was hilarious. I thought I was either going to have to kill her or marry her.  |-|

|-| cnufmqa || 10 || There's something very strange about children and parents getting shitfaced together, at home. I don't get it. One time I stopped by my mom's house unannounced, I'd left something there. I walked in to find my two younger brothers, one was 18 and the other 13. Both of them were outrageously drunk, right along with my mother and step father. The 13 year old was puking his guts out in the rock garden. I was so fucking pissed. My mom's argument was that it was more responsible for them to drink there than somewhere else. My stepfather and my mom died from alcoholism. The 18 year old (now 49) has three DUI's to his record and the 13 year old (now 44) was hospitalized when he was 17 from alcohol poisoning. Both of them are still heavy drinkers.  |-|

MOST people value physical affection so often physical attraction between partners is important . . . but the most important thing is probably to have a friend. You seem to treasure her.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sheryl-paul/love-is-a-verb_1_b_1940731.html

And love isn't always -- or after a while, even -- the romance you always see in movies.

You should try and see her in person with these ideas in mind.

That being said, I suppose it is also worth thinking about how dating unsuccessfully would affect your friendship, and her ability to trust you. If you two will be distanced when you find a parter anyway, it seems okay.

Lastly . . . know that her life isn't terrible even if she doesn't find a partner. She seems to be her family's caretaker, so she probably cannot leave, but I'm sure getting involved with causes she believes in, etc. will be good for her. If there's anything you should do, perhaps it is to try and encourage her to pursue causes she cares for (or an occupation, but I don't know her educational level, status, etc. or even local gender discrimination in India). If it makes her more confident, then if you do choose to try and date her, she will approach the relationship from  a healthier perspective.

We finally decided to meet at a Jamba Juice one particular night. We met and chatted outside on the patio for like two hours till they closed. I asked her if she wanted to come hang out at my place because I had some friends coming over for a kickback. Surprisingly, this 18 year old college girl said yes and followed me back to my place.  We ended up hanging out and talking all night while I ignored calls from my friends who were waiting outside.

The next day I called her and told her she was crazy to just go back to some guy's house who she met online. She agreed and felt embarrassed by it but said I was just too interesting.

I married that girl a year later.

|-| cnukvvk || 266 || Tinder is always a bit of a crap shoot, although I've never had *nearly* that bad of an experience haha. 

My worst was my first. I was in a different city for business with my boss staying at a hotel. This girl agreed to come pick me up from the hotel to watch a movie. We talk for a while in the parking lot smoking a cigarette, and decide that neither of us is probably a murderer, so we head out.

At her house, she decides on Despicable Me. *That's fine, I love the movie to be honest.* Where it get's weird is she is **weirdly** into the movie. Like she won't talk to me at all really and is hysterically laughing at every joke even though she says she's seen the movie over 15 times. Odd, but ok.

The movie ends, she restarts it and finally starts talking to me. Somehow I end up tickling her (*because I'm apparently still in middle school*) but when I get to her neck she freezes. I stop and she says, "No, that feels good keep doing it." So here I am, tickling her neck while she sits with her eyes closed completely unmoving, and insists that I keep going, for like **20 mins**.

Finally we start making out, she asks if I want to spend the night, and I tell her I have to get up early so she drives me all the way back to the hotel. Bizarre experience all around. |-|

|-| cnumbx3 || 3 || Yes it's genuine love but I don't think it's romantic love. Everyone associates love with being romantic but this could be big bro lil sis type of love or you probably just pity her and since you seem like the last person she contacts a lot you may feel a responsibility of taking care of her. Meditate 15 minutes a day reflecting on what you feel.

The best thing you could do is see if she can get great help here in the USA, like surgery and medications. Help her out there. She can live with you and you can see if you truly love her in a romantic sense.  |-|

|-| cnumyur || 3 || better to find out right away, than to find out after you are married with kids |-| 
|-| cnun073 || 3 || Do not underestimate the power of physical attraction in a romantic relationship. She is an acid burn victim, and that means you can't change the fact that her appearance will not be one of the top reasons you will bond with her, let's be honest about that. I have been in relationships where physical attraction was low/null, and yet the relationship was meaningful, but when I compare those relationships to others where the physical aspect was more relevant, the game goes to a whole new level. When you are married to someone you love and at the same is physically attractive, there will be situations in which you will be much more forgiving, just because the person is... attractive to you. I know, this is hard to admit, but here I am just admitting it. Even better, let me give you an example: the other day me and my wife had an argument, and we got really mad at each other... but being on the same bed was all it took for us to reconcile in that day... if you know what I mean. In our case, physical attraction is so powerful that it can even influence other aspects of our relationship that normally could only be resolved with lots of talk or counseling. And last, but not the least, do not underestimate the power of faith. When a couple shares the same faith they also can count with a positive "bonus" in their relationship. In the end, choosing the right woman for you is choosing the right combination of friendship, sex drive, and common values... if any of these assets are missing or are too conflicting, then you will most likely put yourself in a bad situation, sooner or later. Be careful, pray, and good luck! |-|

|-| cnuo8bv || 3 || Does your mom think Carly is lying?  |-| 
|-| cnuo9od || 3 || If you really want to find out if you genuinely love her do a few things.First stop looking at her as if she is some helpless kitten. You have strong protective feelings that might be clouding your judgement of whether or not you love her. Also nobody wants to be pitied, if you bring her over with that mentality it could cause more trouble with your relationship. 

Next, write a list about why you actually like her. It's okay if the list is stupid, as long as you have something to write down about her that you like. Finally, take time away from her. You've spent so much time communicating and not going out it's very possible that you've fell into a habit. Tell her you're going on a trip or whatever, and have Zero communication with her, absolutely none. The "trip" needs to be at least longer than 2 weeks (I would prefer a month) and you need to actually try to meet other people and go out. If you can do all this and still have such strong feelings for her without viewing her as a victim then you're genuinely in love. 

P.S: you don't actually go on a trip |-|

|-| cnupcqh || 3 || Have a similar fuckup from 6 months ago.

Met a girl online.  Talked over PM, then texts.  Seemed pretty normal.

Then, we agreed to a very casual meetup to hang out and talk.  I told her I was going to be with some friends at a bar at around 11PM, and she should stop buy and we'd hang out.  She agreed.

11PM rolls around and she texts me, saying her phone is dead and she's charging it.  I'm like "oh okay, next time then".  She tells me to come over and hang out there.  She made it sound like she was at another bar.  She texts me the address and I end up in this sketchy ass apartment building.

She tells me to just come upstairs.  I knew it was a mistake and I was probably going to die, but I was somewhat drunk so I went with it.  I was fully expecting someone to be behind the door to smash my head in with a bat.

Luckily, that didn't happen.  Could have, though.

She answers the door, BOOM, catfished.  She was not the girl in the instagram she followed me with.  This girl was like 5'2 and 200 lbs, and unattractive, even with beer goggles..  

To not be a complete dick, I went inside and hung out with her for 10 minutes.  She's fucking insane.  She started talking about sex, and all the guys she banged that week, amongst other things.  She started saying more and more sexual things until I got so uncomfortable that I got the hell out of there.

Never again, Reddit.  Never again. |-|

I know that telling you to not feel sad, lonely, pathetic, or emberassed won't do much to make those feelings to away, but I'm doing it anyway. Don't feel sad, lonely, pathetic, or emberassed. The only thing you should feel when you think about this girl is sympathy and joy. She's clearly a bitch and you've had the luck of finding out what she's really like before you further commited yourself to her.  |-| 
|-| cnupejd || 5 || OMG I'm so sorry this happened to you! Wow she is a complete and utter sick and twisted woman with sick and twisted friends. A decent person never pulls this crap.

And if you can get professional help do so. Grief like this is hard. Good luck.  |-|

|-| cnurw42 || 7 || Normally I just read a few TIFUs and move on, but your story reminds of me a little of my past relationship with an ex.  We dated for over 2 years, broke it off for almost 2 years, then relapsed for a year. We've not spoken for almost 3 years now and I now have no idea about anything about her life. If god is good, it will stay that way. I slowly cut out any friends that would apprise me of any updates on her.
&amp;nbsp;

Sure Today you fucked up, but this is a long run win if you let it be. She may have given your ego a hit today, but she gave you the gift to know that girl you remember in your heart doesn't exist anymore. Everything that has happened in the past is a sunk cost and your optimal decision moving forward if for Jess to not enter it in any way. I don't know the exact circumstances for you, but it seems apparent that you two are keeping tabs on each other. Why? It's been 3 years. You only have control of your own actions, and they shouldn't include anything to do with her.
&amp;nbsp;

&gt;saying how pathetic and childish I am, telling me to get over myself and move on already.
&amp;nbsp;

"childish," "pathetic," "move on already." Those definitely describe something to a tee. Remember that it wasn't you doing the childish or pathetic thing here. You're not the one who went and contacted you.
&amp;nbsp;

Maybe you harbored some feelings and thought maybe there's a chance. Well, this TIFU taught you that's not happening. Lesson learned. All you need to do is move on. Sure, easier said that done, but it can and will be done. If you ever think there's hope with her again, you'll just think of this. You'll think of her friends, the people she chooses to be be friends with encouraging her to laugh at a person she spent over 2 years of her own life with. This wasn't a coping mechanism for them right after a heartbreaking split. This was a conscious decision by some people who are definitely a little touched in the head if you ask me.
&amp;nbsp;

If there's one thing I've learned and come to accept in my brief life is that nobody is really important. Nobody is really special and we're all small in the scheme of things. Remember that "after the game, the king and the pawn go into the same box." People are only special or important to you if you make them important or special to you. There are probably 1000 girls out there that can make you happy and you can make happy. Jess isn't one of them. You know that now. Don't let her be. If you go out there you can find a girl willing to hold your hand, give you kisses and play with your penis, and you won't even remember Jess's face if you tried. 
&amp;nbsp;

P.S. just re-read and realized that I'd initially missed this bit:

&gt; she would spread rumours about me every once in a while just to make sure my life was a continuously hell

OK so maybe you should have got the message earlier. I guess she's been trying to tell you for a while that she's a turd, and she just thought it was time to make it absolutely clear.

|-| cnut6l1 || 3 || Have any of you fucking morons heard of talking to the person before meeting up with them?  |-| 
|-| cnutka0 || 3 || what a cunt... just forget her |-| 
|-| cnutkes || 3 || I don't think you fucked up...

...I think she fucked up as a person.  |-| 
|-| cnutp68 || 3 || Similar scenario happened to a group of friends and I when we were young and dumb. We were all piled in my huge lifted '97 Chevy 1500 and they were taking turns using the 100watt PA that was installed; harassing cars around us in good humor. At a red light a beautiful Brazilian woman pulls up in a Altima. My friends start cat calling her, keeping it relatively clean. After about 15 seconds the passenger door to her car opens and 6'7" (estimating) black dude with dreads gets out of the car. dude looked just like Mac Dre with dreads. The image of his dreads swinging around his face as he  did a 180 upon exiting the vehicle will be forever burned into my head. As soon as we saw him we all screamed like girls, everyone is pounding their fists on the dashboard and wheel screaming for me to drive. Light is still red but I look to see if there are  any cars coming, weigh my options, and peel out through the red light. |-| 
|-| cnutpks || 3 || The internet has led to some of the best and some of the worst sexual experiences in my life. On balance, thank you internet |-|

|-| cnuuevi || 4 || This sounds like a 4Chan story |-| 
|-| cnuui44 || 3 || So, this sounds pretty damn similar to Rude Judes tinder story...you just left out the 7-eleven hard on pills and condoms trip, but other than that, I believe you stole this story to make it your own...  |-| 
|-| cnuuivi || 3 || At least she wasn't fucking Zach.  |-| 
|-| cnuupm6 || 5 || OP should have handed the note to the guy, winked at him and strolled away swinging his hips seductively. |-| 
|-| cnuuth4 || 6 || 

Writing a note to a beautiful woman to tell her she's hot because you have no balls to say that to her face screams weird fucking loser.

 |-| 
|-| cnuv25h || 3 || Hope you read this.


I'm going to start with telling you what you know but don't want to hear. You were her plaything. She never loved you and that is OK because you never loved her. You fell in love with what you projected, the person you wanted her to be. The best possible "her".


You are better than her. Come to realize that what you fell in love with is internal to you, a part of you. We're all a bunch of apes driven by our natural desire to procreate and maximize our utility which is why we are burdened with a detrimental emotional attachment to others even when given evidence to not be. It's not your fault but you are the only one that can take control of it.


You sound like a beautiful person, OP. Find someone that can recognize that. Until then, learn that you don't need a SO to be fulfilled.


**AND FUCK JENNY!** |-|

|-| cnux8tx || 55 || Living in a 1 bedroom apartment I can relate to this. Things can get pretty hot and heavy during Mario Kart and I've often wondered what my neighbors think the SO and I are doing. |-|

Lol  |-| 
|-| cnuy38w || 67 || Next time. When your done with the prank Rain-x the whole mirror problem solved and a super clean mirror also.  Probabaly should have told her about the said prank.  Now you just look like an asshole.   |-| 
|-| cnuy3rz || 26 || This should be a prank someone pulls on Jenny.

Anyway, my concern more than her just running off would be what will she do next? Will she tell someone? Will she report you to the police?

Guess we'll just have to wait. |-|

|-| cnuyc9h || 5 || Just text her the same explanation you posted here. She should understand, and if not, that's her own fault to ignore the truth.

|-| cnv3f1w || 78 || Story time. Me and my best friend go over to another friends house. She had Mario kart so we got wasted and played.  2 hours of alcohol screaming and swearing the police walk in. No knock, no warning they straight walk in asking "what the hell is going on in here?" And then immediately died laughing when they saw us holding N64 controllers. 

They knew exactly what was going on. The call had been made because apparently residents thought our friend who I'll call Kristin was being raped. 

My friend turned to them and said "sorry officers the only rape happening here is the fool in first being spoon fed blue shells by the other two assholes in the room" 

We got a nice suggestion we keep it down and informed we made the officers' night. |-| 
|-| cnv3fef || 6 || oh you dirty bitch. i bet he's coming over for kisses later |-| 
|-| cnv3i4s || 40 || This reminds me of one my favorite stories from childhood:

My brother, 8-10 years old is in a heated Kart game, and screaming "Mario! I'm going to kill you! Fuck you Mario!" until the doorbell rings. It's the cops. Apparently 3+ of our neighbors called 911, convinced they were hearing the early stages of genuine murder. Apparently the police blocked off one end of the street. 

My father explained the situation to the police officer, who turned around and shouted to his comrades "It's all right, it's just Mario bruddas."

|-| cnv3sw9 || 27 || It wasn't the note. It wasn't the glances. It wasn't your hair. It wasn't your pants. It wasn't your shirt. It wasn't any of those things. 

It was because you asked a girl out, just based on looks. You didn't even get her name. Not even 1 joke, or introduce yourself. Afterall, if you hand out notes to girls that you think are good looking, why not get a business card and hand them out to anyone attractive over a 7 for you?

Talking to a girl and having her say "I'm flattered, but I have a BF" leaves you with dignity and still a chance that she'll remember you or see you again if she's single and taking you up on it. 

You didn't have much of a window unless you knew what to say with the friend standing there and her wearing headphones prior. 

I've been there though, and if you don't take 1-5 minutes to talk to them before getting *their* number, then it rarely works. But you also had the courage to put yourself in that situation, so kudos.  |-|

Also ten months is pretty long to remain celibate, even if you see one another now and then. Just saying, most people are not that committed.  |-| 
|-| cnv423a || -5 || I want to stick my dick in your butt.  |-| 
|-| cnv42l5 || 7 || I get these same migraines fairly frequently. Like 4-6 times a month. They sure do suck, but I've just learned to live with them as I've had them since I was in my early teens. I still haven't figured out what triggers them exactly, but I have noticed that I will get one when I drink too much caffeine. For example, when my coffee is super strong and I drink it really fast I'll get one. I also get them sometimes by cracking my neck the wrong way. I wont know I did it wrong until the aura comes into play. 

I've managed to prevent most of the pain, discomfort and sensitivity by popping 2 excedrin extra strengths as soon as I start noticing the aura. This phenomenon and type of migraine is still a pretty big mystery to most doctors and specialists. But hopefully this helps! |-|

|-| cnv5chd || 40 || So now, if anyone's kids hear the neighbors actually having sex they can explain the sounds as, "Oh, they were just playing Mario Kart".

In fact, "Playing Mario Cart" can be a new euphemism for sex.  |-| 
|-| cnv5cl5 || 216 || Everyone's saying this means that he's cheating but it doesn't necessarily mean that. From his perspective, your text could mean a lot.

I know from your perspective your text means that you're committed to the relationship and you're glad you're in that relationship. That's really nice, and maybe he misinterpreted?

&gt;"I hope you know I'd never cheat on you. Guys might try sometime" 
 
Basically all you've done is remind him that you could cheat and that people hit on you. I'm 100% this isn't what you meant, but that's how he could have read it.

&gt;"but you're mine"

That's a weird way of putting it. You've not actually reassured him that you're in a relationship (which is what I think you've meant to do) - just that you're being possessive of him. Maybe he panicked and wasn't sure what you meant?

&gt;"we're not even together so it's not technically cheating. You can do whatever you want"

And this could be his way of disengaging from that. It doesn't 100% mean he's cheated, but don't take what I'm saying as 100% that he hasn't. I don't know, but to assume he has seems a little harsh.

The upshot is that you should probably talk to him if you're still interested in the relationship. It sounds like a long distance relationship with poorly communicated boundaries and sincerities and you've sent him a drunk text which woke him up which meant he was pissed, misinterpreted your text and responded with something he didn't mean on impulse. Maybe he actually is sleeping around and resents the fact that you've said you own him? Who knows?

he might have just said this in spite. Felt like you were hooking up with other guys, felt guilty, and texted him. So he assumed the worst. Its definitely a suspicious text at an odd hour of the night. So his response was snarky and sarcastic. More of a "whatever, I dont care anyway" kind of response.

|-| cnv8wuo || 50 || &gt; Needless to say I'm no longer picking up his calls.

Well, there's your FU, right there. I mean, chances are that it is what it looks like. But it could be something else, anything up to some shithead buddy of his grabbing the phone and writing that message as a stupid prank. Basically you risk acting out that ancient romcom cliché where there's some perfectly innocent explanation and he says "Wait, I can explain!" and you say "There's nothing to explain!" and march out and it all goes to hell completely needlessly.

Not that I'm saying "there's an innocent explanation" is the most *likely* outcome. But if my partner of 3 years sent me an apparent "you're dumped" text message, I'd sure as hell invest 5 minutes in a phone call to make sure. |-| 
|-| cnv8xcv || -8 || Alex is probably friends with Zach and X. |-| 
|-| cnv8xfm || 57 || If a girl you don't know too well calls your co-worker a cunt....

|-| cnv97hv || 119 || Humor is great, but foul language isn't funny all by itself. "God she's such a cunt" just isn't funny. If he didn't find it funny, that doesn't make him an asshole. Foul language can add shock value to something funny and make it funnier. Calling people names isn't funny at all, and using foul language to do it just makes you sound like more of an ass yourself. |-|

 |-| 
|-| cnvan6k || 8 || If I got your text I would assume that you're thinking of cheating on me, and probably doing everything short of it. With that in mind I might interpret his response to be along the lines of "I'm dumping you before you're dumping me" knee jerk reaction. I'd pick up the phone and get things straightened out. It may be over, but it would be shitty to assume it is just because of one miss-communication. |-|

Dump him, this Zack guy definitely isn't worth your time. |-| 
|-| cnvaygg || 34 || "we're not even together so it's not technically cheating. You can do whatever you want"

I think he has responded in self-defence, to save himself the pain of having possibly been cheated on, as your text is somewhat suspicious.

Pick up his calls, at least to find out - either way will be easier then living with the regret of never knowing the truth. Trust me. |-| 
|-| cnvb3qx || 8 || my ex and I used to play Mario Kart to decide who would do things like buy dinner, pay the water bill, be on top etc. Needless to say we had lawyers on the phone. |-| 
|-| cnvb538 || -4 || No lady you've got this all wrong, today HE fucked up by being a snob. |-| 
|-| cnvb6lt || 54 || That's super unfortunate. Although, I find it strange that she didn't first assume it was a joke. I feel like if I was comfortable enough to shower at my boyfriend's house, that I would think he was kidding if he wrote something like that on the mirror. Maybe its better that she got scared off by this anyways. Seems like she didn't take jokes well.   |-| 
|-| cnvbai3 || 3 || You should have told him, could have been a great laugh between you and strengthen rather than deteriorate your relationship.  |-| 
|-| cnvbe45 || 4 || Agreed 100% with strwbryfieldfornever; your text could be read as both threatening and weirdly possessive, i.e. "I can easily cheat here but you're not allowed to." If he is feeling insecure about the distance, and read it that way, it would be natural to respond as he did, saying essentially in defense "uh, fuck you, I don't need you, do what you want." 

Not answering his calls is a mistake if you value this relationship. You're misunderstanding his misunderstanding, and dynamiting a longterm relationship. Talk to the guy, for chrissake. |-| 
|-| cnvbfe8 || 33 || You did the right thing, Zack. Jenny doesn't deserve you or her husband who makes 212k a year. Keep trucking through life in your flathouse, and you'll find the right woman soon.  |-|

|-| cnvbwn8 || 3 || Well, that ejaculated quickly. |-| 
|-| cnvbz65 || 8 || Or you could pick up his calls, explain the context of that text message and then ask him what did he mean exactly with his answer. Why throw away 10 months with someone just because you chose not to take your time to explain yourself and listen to what he has to say?

It may be hard but I think it would be best to stop contact with this jerk and start to move on. Seriously, this is making me angry because that's such a fucked up thing for him to do/say ESPECIALLY making it seem like a silly, almost sweet comment that you made is the cause for your "break up".

I think the same thing when politicians cheat on their families and then people say its none of the public's business and doesn't say anything about their character on the job. If they will do all of that to the people they "love" and have made a deep commitment to why wouldn't they do it to people that are not as close to them?   
     
"don't ever get involved with a married woman is my poor advice, "    
So you aren't saying this because you think its a horrible thing to do... You are saying this because the outcome was bad for you? Wow.

That being said, you made a good choice today. It may hurt to let her go but it is for the best. You will find someone else and that person will treat you kindly and make necessary sacrifices to make the relationship work.

No, it wasn't that poorly written. He'd have to go out of his way to misinterpret it. It sounds like he was just waiting for you to give him some excuse to drop this bomb on you.

It's for the best that you got him to share his thoughts and feelings now rather than later. So this wasn't a fuck up at all. Good luck going forward. |-|

You did no wrong, you don't have any obligation of not going out with a married woman because it was not you that assumed the compromise of being faithful. That being said, any and all relationships that grow stale should immediately end, and it was your mistake to keep going. Good job on cutting ties and good luck! (PS: Don't mind these guys/gals who are talking shit about you, they probably had someone cheat on them and as all idiots in the world, put half of the blame on the person who fucked their "special other". The blame is on the person who was in a relationship, as I already explained). |-|

We even exchanged some pics (nothing dirty), and she wanted to travel to meet me, but her husband eventually caught on and told me his side of the story. 

I basically thought about what I was doing, and decided that fucking with married couple just isn't cool. So I controlled my desire for sexy time, rubbed a bunch out, and just told her I wasn't going to fuck with her marriage anymore. Moved on with my life.

Tell them that the interview panel were so busy bickering with each other than you never really got interviewed.

Worst case scenario, they figure you're some kind of troublemaker and forget it - you're already do-not-hire-listed, yeah?

Best case scenario, some higher-up contacts you with "Geez, sorry, we're not really like that, it was a bad show and we'd like to give it another try with different interviewer(s).  Now the ball is back in your court. 

Note that the first scenario is way more likely than the second one is. |-|

The army airborne picture shows you to be highly a professional. (A non-pro perhaps would have started shooting before identifying, yes?)  In a day or so, it may help to explain this, (without bragging), when both of you have calmed down a bit. It may help her to see things more clearly from your point of view how the event transpired. 

I would not try to put off, or avoid her, to talk with her. Speak to her in person, if possible. A soldier knows how to be a gentleman. Listen quietly, calmly, to what she has on her mind. Show understanding with her point of view, also. Treat her with respect and dignity-- even a bit of sugar goes further than a lot of vinegar. 

Oh, and keep the cuss words out of it, hah!

Anyway, commenters told her to report her husband to his (can't remember the exact terminology but I think it was) CO. Apparently the Marine's have a crazy strict moral code of conduct or something and cheating will get your ass in a shitload of trouble. Also, if a Naval officer cheats, one of the punishment he can get is getting stuck on the ship while everyone gets to undock for a long, long time.

"You HAVE to write a narrative about my beautiful back!"
He said he was laughing so much he was worried he would wake me by shaking ... I remember nothing but he loves to tell the story. All. The. Time. |-|

|-| cnxckrq || 13 || When I was in highschool I was staying at my female friends house (I'm a guy). I was sleeping in the room across the hall from her. Now, to set up the next 10 minutes... I'm blind as a bat without my glasses, the room I'm sleeping in has no door, the girl across the hall is absolutely beautiful but 2 years younger than me, and her Mom isn't my biggest fan.

So, it's 4 am and I wake up to my bed shaking. I open my eyes and all I see is a fuzzy figure leaving my room. I'm pretty weirded out, but figure it's my friend. So I go over to her room, gently knock, explain what just happened, and she tells me she was asleep and I wasn't her. 

So I was a tad creeped out, she could tell, and I ended up laying with her for a minute till I calm down (her suggestion).

When I'm about to go back to my room her Mom barges in and just yells "Separate rooms, Now!". I try to explain, she won't hear it, I go back to the other room and somehow fall asleep.

So the next morning I'm freaked to go out front for breakfast, expecting her family to be less than pleasant with me. I go out there and... Everything was normal and fine, and no one said anything.

Later that day I find out that her Dad had walked by my room that morning, saw that the blinds were open, and came in to close them. He is a shorter guy and him leaning over the bed to reach them was what caused the shaking. We all had a huge laugh about it.

|-| cnxihaf || 3 || I did a similar thing in the 7th grade. 

We were doing some type of physical testing out on the athletic field, and after each exercise we had to come report the results to the P.E. coach, Coach Hunt. 

After an exercise I ran up and rehearsed in my head what I would say so I could get in and out of the line as quick as possible. I would say "Hey coach my time was XX for the 50 yard dash" (or whatever it was.) 

So I ran up and my brain scrambled and I tried to say two things at once, "Hey Coach" and "Hey Coach Hunt" came out "Hey Coach Cunt." He yelled something at me and tried to hit me with his clipboard so I ran away. I was 13 so it was pretty embarrassing.

TL;DR I scrambled my words like OP in this story and called my P.E. teacher a cunt. |-|

Who gives a fuck if the cashier is black, white, mexican.. etc. Hell, I wouldn't care if he was fluorescent green as long as he processes my items for me. He's just a regular guy like you, with a family and kids who's trying to pay the bills.

Why even make conscious thought about trying to be *extra* nice to him just because he's black? What does it matter? |-|

Nobody did anything except for her just hitting his arm like "oh you"? Doubt it.

You just literally ran off in the middle of the transaction? Doubt it.

I seriously wonder how long you spent creating this story just to post it here. It is quite literally the least believable thing I have ever seen on this sub. I'm embarrassed for you, not because of the story, but because I am 99.9% positive that this story is completely fabricated. |-|

Of course the store was busy as fuck, and it was pretty loud in there. As we were checking out, the cashier (a pretty good looking black woman) asked my mother if she wanted the milk in a bag. The next item on the conveyor was a watermelon. My mother didn't hear her, but saw the cashier was waiting for a response from her so asked what was going on. The cashier repeated herself to which my mother replied "Oh, no that is fine. Sorry I had no idea what was going on, I thought you were about to steal my watermelon! Ha ha ha!"

My wife and I froze in horror. The cashier seemed to realize my mom was just dumb and not racist and carried on with getting us out of her way ASAP. It wasn't until we got into the car and I explained to my mom what happened that she realized how dumb she sounded.  |-|

When I was younger and didn't have kids, one of the things I used to say when I saw babies was "Oh, they're so cute when they're young." And one day I said it about a black kid, and the dad gave me a really dirty look. because how was he to know it was something I said about *all* kids? |-|

It's funny to me that everyone is jumping on you as a racist without knowing you. It is such a terrible thing to call someone and attack someones character, yet everyone is so comfortable and quick to do it. And it leads nowhere. IMO it is as disgraceful to call someone such a thing so quickly as it is to be a racist and bigoted individual.  

The whole racism card is so overplayed in the States it is sickening. Yes there was a lot of tension in the past to say the least, and still today... But people have to be able to get over it and recognize the absurdity of the underpinnings of the racial stereotypes and see the humor in it. It is the whole dancing around the issues as unmentionable  that keeps it going strong in it's current form. All parties involved need to be comfortable in moving forward and poking holes in it. Humor is typically the best. While there are certain things that still do invoke pain and heartache in some, empathy is needed for those still struggling to help them come along.  |-|

gas build up in the grill?  check

Dude, food in a crock pot tastes delicious and you can season it just as much. The beauty of a crock pot, *especially* with beef stew, is that you can buy crappy cheap meat, cook it for 6-8 hours, and have it melt in your mouth. It's also really easy because you really just need one space on your counter to cut everything up, then you clean off your cutting board and knife and you're done.  |-|

|-| cnxqoib || 9 || You need to see if there is any degree you can get with credits you have and stop worrying about the business program. Get it done. Having a degree of any sort is 90% of the use of most degrees to get past screening for certain jobs, etc. I'd try a change of scenery to hopefully get you out of your cycle. Find a job a couple towns over, move, ditch the room mate, and hope that starting anew will allow you to break old habits.

If this had come earlier I'd be tempted to just say that college isn't for everyone. Getting a technical associates degree might have been a better choice, but hindsight is 20/20 and all. |-|

|-| cnxrw0c || 28 || I got stuck on a 4 hour plane ride with a Jehovah's Witness. He asked if I was religious and I said no I don't believe in following organized religion. 

He ran through tons of religious questions, my favorite one was "Do you know the true name of God?"

So I asked him if he meant YAHWEH, or YHWH if you cannot pronounce it, or Jehovah.

Dude almost shit a brick and asked how I knew so many things about religion. I said I have read the bible but that I just did not believe in man made religions.

One of the nicest people I have ever met on a plane. He wasn't one of those pushy assholes. He was just curious about what I knew and how I knew it. 

Also went for a walk one night and was wearing all black with a hoodie and these Mormon guys were out doing their mission stuff and they stopped to ask me how I was doing. It was right when I was having a massive anxiety attack which is why I was going for a walk. It was just nice that someone asked how I was, and they were really friendly.  |-| 
|-| cnxs0bd || 10 || I once was eating delicious chicken nuggets. I dipped them in barbecue sauce and everything. I felt something strange on my tongue but ignored it thinking it was a nugget bit or something. After eating most of them, I dipped it again. I saw a little black spec. When I looked closer, it was a baby roach. I looked on all the nuggets, but they were clean. When I looked through the sauce, baby roaches....baby roaches all through that shit. |-| 
|-| cnxs7tq || 3 || The last time I attempted to spit out the car window, I didn't give it enough oomph and it landed on the sill (half inside, half outside). The time before that, the car was moving and it landed on the rear window. I have since become a swallower. |-| 
|-| cnxsc31 || 10 || If it makes you feel any better, my best friend and I made that same mistake when we were younger. We really loved this bruschetta that they made at a local deli, so we asked for the recipe. Then we went to the grocery store all excited to make this recipe and surprise my mother. So we bought all of the ingredients we needed and headed home, two young girls with a bright idea. Once we got home we cut everything up and mixed it all together. Then we made some crostini to top with the bruschetta mixture. We plated those fuckers and even set the table so we enjoy all of the deliciousness that is fresh bruschetta. We took one bite and had to spit it out because the garlic was so strong. What went wrong with our precious tomatoey (is tomatoey even a word? It is now.) goodness?? Well, young ramabamamoo and young ramabamamoo's friend had put in 1 bulb of garlic instead of 1 clove. ABOUT 12X THE RECIPE. Normally, people would throw out the offending mixture. But not us. We were in this for the tasty, tasty tomatoes. So once we realized our mistake we did a little bit of math, and headed back to the grocery store. Neither of us had very much money left, but we bought a couple more pounds of tomatoes, hoping it would be enough to dilute the garlic flavor enough to be edible. Well, it made it edible. Barely. Instead, we went to the all-knowing mother and begged for help. Anything. So we used our mixture as the topping to make a pizza. Actually, five pizzas.

This is always the first story to come up whenever our families get together and the fact comes up that I have since become a chef. Right before the story of the time I managed to set raw spaghetti on fire.  |-|

She had never cooked before and they lived with their parents, moving out only when they married.

They will be able to help you feel more in control of your situation. Second, can you donate plasma? You can do it a few times a month, and any little extra bit of money helps. Look that up around you... you can use that money to help ease the burden of your payments.  
  
You will get through this OP... I know that this is overwhelming, but I believe in you. Never give up; if you keep pushing, one day this will be a thing of the past. Try to look forward, instead of focusing on the past. There is nothing you can do about mistakes you have already made, but you *can* start taking steps to make it better. Seriously though, put this in /r/personalfinance and follow their advice. They will give you ideas on all of your options and the best things that you can do.

What takes a couple of months to screw up can take 5-10 yrs to correct on your credit.  It's a frickin nightmare.  I'm not trying to scare you about your bills now....just warning you not to do it again in the future.  All the loan companies/govt care about is getting their $$ back, and as long as you are doing payment arrangements....you'll be ok, and your credit WILL start going back up.

Add to that your lack of attention to detail in hastily sending out this important document, and I'm sure that they'll see your value as a potential employee and call for an interview.

Hopefully, you gave them the right contact information and not your work phone number... |-| 
|-| cnxtmw8 || 3 || Man, I totally believe you and it's because I've been exactly there. I don't expect you to fully understand, but suffice it to say that I'm from Ontario Canada and we Ontarians have a complicated relationship with our neighbors from Quebec. 

Whenever I go to Quebec I get very nervous about interacting with Quebeckers - especially in more rural parts of the province - because I feel like my lack of French speaking makes me come off like a douche. 

So one time when we went, my wife and I go to a restaurant and I get very nervous about what I'm going to say to the waiter. I spent ages preparing my opening line and steeling myself for the interaction. 

My plan was to say "is it okay if we speak English? because my French is shit" but of course what came out was "is it okay if we speak English because French is shit"

The exact opposite of what I wanted to say, much like in your case. So I feel you.  |-|

|-| cnxuddv || 5 || &gt; Update: I figured there was no reasonable way I could come out of this cleanly, so I did what any honorable person would do, I wrote a TIFU.

|-| cnxyf26 || 5 || About 20 years ago I had a similarly unfortunate incident. 

I dreamt I was about to do combat with someone hell-bent on doing me harm. I decided to apply a particular strike/grab to his larynx (thumb and first 2 fingers), something I'd learned at the martial arts school where I was enrolled. 

I got the grab nicely placed, my other hand getting a fistful of hair, when I awoke to the sound of my wife screaming "stop it stop it you're choking me!"

Turns out I was, in fact, choking her. That was the only time that ever happened.

This is what separates the lunatics from the guys with girlfiend's parents that let them have sex in the house.

Gotta tell ya, Spanky, I've read a lot of mess-ups on this page but yours takes the cake.  You need to learn what humor is before you try it out first-time on your girlfriend's parents.  Some things are genuinely funny but insulting your [ex?] girlfriends parents isn't one of them.  The best thing you could do is to go over to her house and admit that you were "very aghast, nervous, and bashful to be invited to such a situation." and tried to get through it by using some impromptu humor which clearly backfired.  It's called telling the truth.  Give it a try.  If not, you've only got yourself to blame.

One other tidbit: when you've made someone so mad that they tell you to "Get the eff out of his house", don't try to challenge that person by telling them they're being irrational.  You were a guest.  No one hired you as the smart-arsed comedian for the night. |-|

|-| cny0ftc || 11 || Tip: Your resume will get lost in a folder if you just title it "Resume.docx"

Add your name to it to make it easier for recruiters to locate. Like "Resume_Cunt_Wilson.docx" |-| 
|-| cny0fzk || 46 || Huh. I read this entire TIFU with an Irish accent. |-|

|-| cny1120 || 3 || So what were you planning to do if the parent's thought your acting was funny? |-| 
|-| cny13ri || 4 || I think you're making mistakes here. First ask yourself if the whole potato joke was a mistake? Was it funny, looking back was it funny? If the answer is no, then ask yourself when no one laughed or smiled immediately after would it have been better to admit it was a joke or continue insisting it wasn't? If the answer was you regret not owning up to the joke, think about the fact that in a month you might regret not owning up to it now. To admit to it being a joke now is going to be very embarresing and you'll lose a lot of face. Just be honest tell them you were really nervous and didn't know what to do to make a good impression. They will think you are an idiot. But let's face it you kind of are. However, everybody is an idiot about something at some time in their lives. I for example am a grown man and can't spell embarresing correctly.

What separates real idiots from the rest of us is the ability to recognize our mistakes and own up to them. Just call them. |-|

|-| cny1al7 || 16 || When I was in high school I committed to doing a Mexican accent for a day. The teachers started to get really mad.

|-| cny1xtp || 4 || When I first started having sleep overs with my boyfriend, I found out that I sleep talk a bit. 

I was having a dream that I was back living with my mother again and she took some chicken breasts I planned to use and made something else. When I found out, dream-me punchd the cabinet next to the fridge in her kitchen and I said 'that's not cool'.

I had punched my boyfriend in the back and then said 'that's not cool'. He's like, 'No, it's not. What the hell?'

Then he realized and woke me up and I had a giggle fit.  |-| 
|-| cny1ym4 || 662 || This is literally the dumbest thing I have ever heard, this is one of my favorite fuck ups ever. It's got everything: potatoes, girls, dads, confusion, and yelling. I love the fact you thought of this, and I love that the parents got so mad about it.  |-| 
|-| cny201u || 77 || You messed up my friend. Should have owned up to the joke quickly when you saw it wasn't working with a "nah I'm just messing with you guys". |-|

|-| cny23pt || 4 || As a former mormon, and former mormon missionary, I am so, so sorry. |-|

As I'm putting everything away I pull out his "small onion" apparently he had no idea that's what garlic looked like and just figured it was tiny white with a papery outside? Must be a small onion.  |-| 
|-| cny27ig || 4 || You totally baked him... |-|

|-| cny2rcs || 3 || tell your professor that a simple joke before class should be responsible for the grade of your assignment. And its not based on behavior. Get your principal/parents involved. |-| 
|-| cny2t9e || 3 || Holy Shit, I swear to god there were parts of your story that I had to double take to make sure I did not write myself. There were so many parts of your story that reflected my personal experience, it's slightly depressing and comforting to know someone else has/is going through a similar series of fuck ups. High fives for low lives amigo.

Similarities include working full time, poor grades, losing focus, getting a girl pregnant (subsequently terminated as well), draining those emotions in a bottle (for two years and kicked out of college in the meantime), going to community college to get my shit together, getting back in to school and getting lost and probably many more... It's like you're my brother from another mother who thank god wasn't knocked up by us :/. I'm making light of a very serious situation but I think you know what I mean. The emotional shrapnel that comes with these kind of life choices are the consistently wounding. I know there are times when I still can't wrap my head around the complexity of my fuck ups and the money I dropped down the drain. I still try and talk to my ex who I went through this with from time to time but she hasn't responded in a year or so. Her life didn't go that great, she dropped out of college shortly after (it's 50/50 she would have either way but I always wonder if I would have bitten the bullet if she would have been happier... I digress...

Here's the part where we start to differentiate. I got help. I should and always will give credit to my parents for throwing my broken ass into therapy. I don't know what kind of support system you have behind you but if you're working 40 a week it's likely you have some sort of health benefits I guess... I know it seems like a trivial thing to spend money in an already tight situation but trust me it can make the world a different place. It's the little things that really came together, not gigantic breakthroughs and realizing my dog touched me wrong as a kid but actually just sitting down with someone to sort out your life even just a bit that can make a huge difference. Fun fact, I called my therapist Yoko because, well, she looks like Yoko Ono. That's not relevant but considering how many pills she was giving me at some points it's a little disturbing in hind sight. Oh yeah, don't be afraid of anti depressants, they help a lot. I am no longer on them but I don't know how I would've done it without them.

Now as far as your financial situation goes, I have no clue. I would suggest maybe posting to /r/FinancialAdvice, those guys are great in situations like this. Often times you'll find a post where somebody who actually works in some of the institutions currently trying to fist your life who know the ropes to help you out. Otherwise I would be on the phone as much as possible trying to figure this out.

I know my opinion is biased because I came out with a degree and hopefully the start of some financial security but I am only 27 as well. You've got a whole lot of life ahead of you and you are by far not the only one in this kind of situation. 

I don't know why I typed this all out, I've never really personally responded to anyone on here but I hope you're not giving up. You've obviously got the smarts to get through this and you sound like a decent worker. If you ever want to talk I'm shit at financial advise (funny, I'm a financial analyst but that mostly involves playing with excel all day) but I'll try and remember this throwaway/password in case you drop a line.

|-| cny36jq || 4 || Mormon missionaries are forbidden to have direct contact with family and friends for two years (guys) or 18 months (girls). The ~~corporation~~ church allows them to call home on Christmas and Mother's Day. They are made to believe that their eternal salvation depends on their exact adherence to this and other arbitrary rules. They risk being sent home early if they do not follow these rules, which would result in extreme public shame back home. They work 90+ hours a week, are required to buy their own clothing and supplies, receive a few tens of dollars a month as a living allowance, and pay hundreds of dollars per month for the "privilege" of recruiting tithe-paying ~~customers~~ members.

**But it's totally not a cult or anything.**

Because rule 10 - reddit mods can do wtv they want without any consideration of professionalism despite having a following of over 2 million subscribers. When asking for the resignation of that mod after he called pretty much everyone here an idiot, wortheless, and a bunch of other things - clearly breaking "rule 5", instead I was the one banned.

|-| cny3o4o || 230 || What I love about this post is that in my eyes, you completed your goal of being hilarious. 

Pretending not to know what a potato is isn't what's funny, what's funny is you played it as a character almost and made this huge awkward situation. You were so committed you made your girlfriends' parents turn into angry lunatics. 

The humor of the palpable tension and awkwardness (at least it sets me off) is already great, but think of the story you now have. You made a girlfriend's parents hate you within an hour of meeting you *because you acted like you didn't know what a potato is*. It's honestly hard to think of dumber, more innocuous things to elicit such a reaction. That's amazing. 

I feel like this is something Norm MacDonald would do and love.  |-|

|-| cny6bsi || 8 || Being an adult means owning up to your mistakes. Everyone is human and everyone gets nervous, especially around parents. 

Tell your girlfriend that you were nervous, and thought that joke would help ease the tension. When it didn't work, you weren't sure how to proceed, so you figured you'd keep playing with the not knowing what a potato is. You realize now, you should have just been upfront. Apologize again. 

Then go personally speak with her parents (do this even if you two still break up, trust me). Tell them what you told her and apologize for being rude and ask for a fresh start, clean the slate. 

If she didn't breakup with you, she will find this quality to admit your mistakes attractive. If she did breakup with you, she may rethink your maturity and ask you to get back together. Either way, you may have to do business with them in the future, see them, or whatever and want to clear your reputation with them.  |-|

   I knew this was gonna be a bad fuck up, but was not prepared for the WTF that went through my mind.   That was pretty brutal, OP.   Glad you guys moved past that. |-| 
|-| co98528 || 33 || For sale: Baby shoes, never worn. |-| 
|-| co97phn || 22 || Damn, that is rough. I had a similar fuckup recently with a co-worker.  We're in the service industry and were having a particularly slow night. I made a joke that we all needed to be on suicide watch for each other so we didn't kill ourselves out of boredom. A waitress shot me this look of shock and immediately walked away. Turns out the previous week she had attempted suicide and was recently released from the hospital. Apparently I was the only one who didn't know and the rest of the staff thought I was being a callous prick.  |-| 
|-| co96q7t || 20 || Hopefully she didn't see that Nationwide commercial during SuperBowl. |-| 
|-| co93oaf || 49 || I made a, "I think it was the door that hit you, actually" joke to and about my formerly abused friend about an instance where her ex smashed her face with a door (she was telling the story to someone at the time and somehow it was relevant. it's been a while). sometimes you just don't think first. |-| 
|-| co9ashv || 19 || Here's one that went the other way:

Wife plays World of Warcraft.  I had a long-time habit of saying, "Your mom .... " to whatever she said.  For example, "I'm hot."  "Your mom's hot."  You get the idea.  Anyways, her mom had passed away about 10+ years ago.  While playing WoW, she said "I died."  You guessed it.  "Your mom died."  She laughed her ass off.

To the OP, blurting shit out doesn't always go badly. |-| 
|-| co97ghi || 14 || This is the worst TIFU, I have ever read. You really and wholeheartedly fucked up! |-| 
|-| co97bvi || 7 || Did she get the tattoo anyway?   |-| 
|-| co99qmz || 5 || The very fact that she didn't spend the next hour kicking you in the balls until they were coming out your ears means you were lucky.   |-| 
|-| co99j4a || 4 || Good god OP, you're going to need to work on building up that filter in between your mouth and your brain if you want a happy marriage. |-| 
|-| co9amtq || 4 || Am I the only one who laughed?  |-| 
|-| co96e54 || 4 || OP is not only lucky to have kept his wife but also his front teeth |-| 
|-| co98u6a || 3 || Brilliant initiative, but the execution lacks a certain finess...  |-| 
|-| co9c3cc || 3 || Don't beat your self up over that too much. The idea was a unique one (I liked it), it was likely the delivery or tone. She sounds like she was more hurt by the first part than the second.  
  
I've found most times when someone comes to you with an issue they're looking more for moral support than actual ideas. |-| 
|-| co9c7g5 || 3 || Hahahahhaaha.  That was a brillant joke! |-| 
|-| co9mue6 || 3 || This happened to me once... I never felt so bad. 

Me and my ex were having a party and we were very drunk when he received a phone call that his mom and brother were in a car crash and his mom died on impact. Long story short we get to the hospital to stay with his 12 year old bro who was In bad shape, ex cracks something to me and i cracked back at him with "your mom". 

:( it was a nasty habit i had of just replying that to shit. I felt so bad. He was all the way down the hall. I still hope he didnt hear it. It looked like he didnt. I asked his mother forgiveness at the funeral silently.  |-| 
|-| co92afi || 8 || That's a bold move Cotton! |-| 
|-| co97liu || 5 || It's honestly not a terrible suggestion at all. I really don't think anyone would figure it out though it is quite self-explanatory, so it would be very private. Similarly, I don't know of anyone who just has a crib tattoo, so it would be quite unique. At least it's honest and would allow her to be honest with herself, unlike getting a flower or a bird or something generic/generically "pretty" or "lovely". Plus, she could remind you of what an asshole you are all the time. Sounds like she either wasn't ready to share that with you or she still hasn't actually processed it herself, probably a bit of both. |-| 
|-| co9a6tk || 3 || That was worth about 8 1/2 lives, dude. Be luck you have this remarkable lady in your life! |-|

you could totally have meant it like that.. some sort of solidarity, us against the screws, sort of thing.. also saying something like "these allergies are terrible! i am so stopped up i can't smell anything!

except that she obviously knew she smelled like fish and was sensitive about it.. |-|

|-| co9i6tf || 5 || Why would you call her "fresh fish" when she smelled like "unfresh fish"? Immediately go to her, and HR, and clear up the mistake. You meant "unfresh fish"! |-| 
|-| co947nq || 5 || i was expecting something else entirely, here in my country (and don't know if anywhere else) is kind of a misogynist joke, when a girl is called a fish because the body is good-looking but the head/face is ugly |-|

I recently turned 29 and as any red blooded men pushing 30, I'm beginning to become very attracted to older women. 35-42 is where it's at for me. Which brings me to my coworker. Let's call her Lisa.

^

Normal guy

&gt;
Lisa is gorgeous. She's soft spoken and feminine. You can tell she was a knockout in her younger years but to me, she's beautiful as she is right now. She's married and has a family so I'm not going to pursue anything but that doesn't stop me from talking about it to my coworker, Jim.
Jim sits right next to me.

^

Normal guy

&gt;
Guess who's cubicle is right across from Jim's cubicle? Yep. Lisa's.
Well today she went out to lunch and I told Jim how I'm attracted to Lisa

Normal guy

and all the things I'd do to her.

|-| co9iplo || 6 || Today you fucked up by getting an un-spayed cat. Bravo though. :) |-| 
|-| co9k1ji || 6 || Okay, you now have a cat, remember this commandment:

You shall love the Lord your cat with all your soul, with all your heart, and with all your might.

The fact that the cat brought the mouse to your bed shows you that this cat has chosen to bond with you, very early in your relationship I might add! You should be deeply honored. It sounds like an absolutely wonderful little kitty-cat.

You're going to have to get it fixed though. |-| 
|-| co9mpvt || 4 || I really hate that I know this, but if your cat is in heat and singing, you can wet a q-tip and manually help a girl out. I've never personally had to do it but I read the information somewhere. Google it. Yuck.  |-| 
|-| co9el7j || 14 || Haha that great! Maybe not for you but this story made me laugh.

Something similar happened to my friend who liked to grab our leg while in the other stall. This was actually in a changing room for a water park though. So in we go and he goes in a room first. My other friend and I realize we forgot our towels on a lounge chair so we went and got those. We come back in and this man gets out of the stall next to my leg grabbing friend with a embarrassed/getting da fuck outta here kinda look. We then tell my friend we were not in the stall next to him, he bursts out laughing and says he held some guys leg for at least 5 seconds waiting for a response only to have the guy awkwardly leave without actually changing... poor guy. |-|

|-| cogw8nc || 161 || Oh my god, I remember being ina  group of appropriately aged teenagers playing lazer tag in the 90's and having some random old weird guy join us. He took it SO seriously and completely unbalanced our teams.

His lazer tag tactic can only be described as an ass crab. The sensor points for lazer tag are on your shoulders and on your gun. This guy played the entire game bent over, with his ass in the air, shuffling around backwards while shooting people between his legs. 

It was a little offputting charging around the corner and running into creepy old ass-crab man. |-|

|-| cognreo || 203 || I think everyone knows a "Mark". |-| 
|-| cogxd5f || 29 || I work at a laser tag place.


I can verify, people like Mark in this story do exist, and I can verify that they do tend to smell like they haven't showered in a few days, and they always seem to come in to play whenever I'm working. Or they just come in every single day, even when I'm not there. It's actually very likely that they do. |-| 
|-| cogq4xy || 26 || What kind of job do you have? Does Mark Have?  |-| 
|-| cogqtwk || 24 || Mark sounds like Will Ferrel in "Stepbrothers".  |-| 
|-| cogwpse || 16 || What if Mark doesn't actually exist and is a figment of your imagination like in *Fight Club*?

|-| cogovt9 || 81 || Was it legen... |-| 
|-| cogu373 || 9 || While I totally agree this guy is a bit of a bizarro, laser tag can be a pretty grown up activity if you're with the right group at the right place. Was this one of those family fun centers that offers a bunch of overpriced options of a dedicated laser tag place?  |-| 
|-| cogu0re || 28 || I'm having the hardest time believing this story. Is this real life? |-| 
|-| cogr8ce || 20 || Much respect OP for staying calm in that situation. And you considered his mental well-being despite the trouble and embarrassment he caused you, doing so probably kept it from becoming an even bigger FU |-| 
|-| cogq6jk || 40 || I bet Mark is just drowning in pussy |-| 
|-| cogo1se || 27 || Well, it could be worse. He could have been a rapist. |-| 
|-| cogse6q || 108 || you must be a real pushover, dude. Can't you say "I'm not into that, I'm going home after work"? |-| 
|-| cogvvx5 || 7 || Today you fucked up because you had the opportunity to spare yourself when he goes on a spree and shoots up the work place. Now you're going to be number one on his hit list, all because you couldn't play it cool for an evening of laser tag. RIP OP. |-| 
|-| cogxeqo || 7 || I've known quite a few Marks/Dwights in my life and got sucked into their escapades because I'm nice, and I've ended up going on humiliating adventures with them like the OP did. It didn't help that I wasn't popular in elementary/junior high/high school so I found myself in situations where it was either hang out with a Mark or hang out with no one. 

Anyway, the rule for interacting with social outcasts is that there are two groups: ones that *deserve* to be outcasts (because they are completely oblivious to how much they hurt/bother people) and ones that don't. Marks fall into the former category. Being friendly to a Mark is an exercise in futility as he'll never change, drag you down, humiliate you and piss you off in the process. The last time I hung out with a Mark like this was about eight years ago and I ended up stealing shopping carts with him, smoking really bad pot (I think he sprayed Windex on it) and getting punched in the head by someone Mark pissed off (all in the same night!) 

Just to clarify, I don't think Mark deserves to be friendless. He just deserves friends who are on his level. If you think grown men dressing up in tactical gear and playing "LT" is weird then avoid Marks like the plague as they live for that shit.  |-|

|-| cog662b || 223 || I'm going with black. Her favorite color is black. Negro is the correct answer. |-| 
|-| cogawh0 || 205 || She had no sense of humor.  The appropriate answer to that question is "corduroy". |-| 
|-| cogdtjv || 60 || I once tutored a group of blind teens (college prep). No way any of them would've been fazed by "what's your favorite color?"  Just about all of them would have cracked jokes. They often talked about "seeing" a movie or tv show with zero irony. |-| 
|-| coggkpq || 51 || Mildly relevant:

In Katawa Shoujo (a visual novel with disabled people) the protagonist asks the blind girl what her favourite colour is.

She happily tells it's white because she's been told that's the colour of snow, ice cream and lilies.

Previously she assured him that he doesn't have to feel awkward when he accidentally responds with "I see" in a conversation, as he shouldn't change his manner of speaking just for her. |-|

|-| coge74e || 78 || How did she cry if she had no eyes? |-| 
|-| cogmbj5 || 11 || See, it's the reactions like this that make me think that some of these are fake. I'm not saying this one is fake, but I wouldn't be surprised if it is. First of all, if this girl is in high school, I'd think she'd be pretty much over being blind. Yes it'd still suck but I wouldn't think she'd cry every time she's made aware of her blindness. Plus, the whole class and the teacher just staring at you? And then never being partners again after that because of this? It's not as if you chose to say this statement. It was given to you. And furthermore, blind or not, you both need to learn those words and how to use/understand them in context in order to effectively learn the material of a Spanish class. So I don't know, I think this is bullshit but I could be wrong.  |-|

|-| cogk8ny || 8 || I wouldn't doubt this is a true story but somehow the extent of mortification from the girl doesn't seem true. I've known plenty of people with disabilities (including blind people) and have never once had the occurrence of seeing them being anything but empowered by their deficiency or completely unphased by other peoples lack of understanding or awkward mishaps in social situations. Especially if she's a sophomore, chances are she's been dealing with her disability way too long (possibly since birth) to let something silly like this effect her so much.  So for that I'm calling shenanigans.  Could be wrong. |-| 
|-| cogch64 || 24 || You didn't fuck anything up.

"That day, the blind girl totally fucked up by being incredibly over sensitive" |-| 
|-| cogqxmt || 4 || wow its not your fault though i mean you were really set up by your teacher |-| 
|-| cogihyr || 9 || I did this! I did spanish for a year when I went to college and there was a blind girl in our class. I got paired with her because we sat next to each other. I didn't know she was blind until she introduced herself "Hi, Im Bree, uh, just so you know I cant see. Im blind. " she said pointing to her glasses. "Ah, I see." I said. Thankfully my rapid nervous stuttering smoothed it over and we kind d of laughed.
Once we got to questions she asked me my favorate color (I said green" and then I asked her hers. 
"Well I dont know really, but I think it would be the same" 
She was so much cooler with it than your girl. I feel bad for both of you. I only talked with her a few times after that class but she was really cool. She sang, and played the guitar. I honestly thought about asking her out once but I was in a relationship and I think that might be why I broke away from her. |-| 
|-| cogivfb || 3 || I think, everybody should've just laughed. Like, not at her but with her. If she'd been laughing that is, in the first place.

My thinking is that once you're blind, might as well join it. Life is shit anyway, better find happiness in that shit. --Nietzsche 

But maybe she was really fragile girl, and totally not okay with her disability, perhaps she had seen at some point, making the blindness more crushing for her.

I'm thinking of the guy who does YouTube clips about being blind, and he's like totally fine with it. I kind of envy him. So balanced and happy, non-complaining person. |-| 
|-| cogkltc || 3 || I knew a boy who was born without eyes. He loved the color blue, just because the name was really fun to say. So, yeah........ |-| 
|-| coglkmj || 3 || Ask for a blind date next time. |-| 
|-| cogmjy4 || 3 || Kind of have to doubt the extremeness of her crying and teacher splitting you two... I've spend plenty of time with blind people, and at least they have been pretty accepting of the condition and don't cry about it, because there's not much of reason to.

Nothing wrong in forgetting for moment that they are blind either, it's normal even for people who spend more time with blind relatives. |-| 
|-| cogqn0c || 3 || I'm sorry dear! Its too bad she doesn't gave a sense of humor! 

My dad is blind and had been his whole life. As a kid, I asked him this same question and he actually gave me a response. Yellow. I'll never forget it because he always says that yellow is what he imagined the sun felt like in a color. In fact, all his blind friends actually do have a favorite color! My dads friend from blind schools favorite color is maroon, which I always found odd.  |-|

OP and blind girl are married with twelve children and a lake house. |-| 
|-| cogijd3 || 3 || I bet neither you or her saw that coming.  |-| 
|-| cogj2sp || 3 || I'm surprised this was such an issue for her.  My son is completely blind (from birth) and has no problem with these kind of questions.  And, yes, he does have a favorite color (yellow).  We/He also have several completely blind friends that would quickly share their favorite color with you, despite never having actually seen it. |-|

|-| cogejag || 25 || This a fuck up worthy of the subreddit |-|

Holy fucking shit what is wrong with you?  You literally assaulted your boyfriend.  That's not an accident.  He made it abundantly clear that ripping off wax strips was the exact thing he didn't want you to do, and you ignored that and did it anyway.  That's disgusting behaviour.

I know it seems like I'm a little wound up over this but if you're doing anything BDSM-related consent is THE most important thing.  It should be respected without question.   If you have bondage tape I'm assuming you do this kind of thing fairly often, and that really worries me.  The issue is not that on this occasion it happened to end badly, and the solution is not avoiding this precise set of circumstances under the assumption that lightning only ever strikes in the same place.

There are two key things you need to do:

* Never, EVER mix alcohol with anything involving tying each other up or causing each other pain.  Being drunk can cause people to not realise when their limit has been passed and sustain excessive injury
* If he says stop, FUCKING STOP.  IMMEDIATELY.  NO BARGAINING. |-| 
|-| cogi2wq || 89 || Throwaway account. I'm 28, male, and my girlfriend is 25. To set the scene, my girlfriend is an adorable, dainty, petite 5'6" and probably the most feminine straight girl in the universe. Some guys like tall toned muscular girls, but not me.
Anyway, she usually keeps her vulva nicely hairless, but let it grow out over the winter. This upset her greatly, as her formerly smooth vulva was tainted by dirty animalistic fur. Thick fur.
Typically she shaves, but I decided I wanted to have some fun with her.
I convinced her to let me wax her. She's never been waxed before.
I began the evening by getting her plastered. Admittedly, I had a bit to drink too. In retrospect that may not have been the best idea. I also should have had her trim her long vulva-fur first, but no. I tied her to the bed with bondage tape, slathered on the hot wax, and started going to town with the strips.
RIPPPP.
RIPPPPPPPPP!
Her screams escalated from pain to the threshold of madness itself. Blood trickled from her pores but it didn't stop me. I was relentless. She was crying and bleeding and laughing like a deranged hyena, but I kept going.
It was hilarious. I have never laughed so hard in my life. I thought I was going to black out.
Finally, after much more pain, she snapped - and by that I mean she snapped her wrists out of the bondage tape. In what seemed like a single bound she crossed our bedroom, still laughing like a madman.
"I can't take it anymore. This is way too painful! I'm going to pass out."
She was so caught up in the pain that she hadn't realized that there was still a waxing strip firmly fixed across her vulva, directly pasted across her clitoris.
I was so caught up in the hilarity of the whole situation that I hadn't noticed she was standing directly in front of the window.
"Ok, just one more," I said. Without hesitating, without so much as a breath or a bat of an eye, I stood up, reached out, and tore that sucker right off her vulva like I was starting a lawnmower.
Instantly she screamed, flung herself backward with full force, and crashed through the window.
Fast forward through thinking I killed her, a frantic 911 call, an ambulance ride for her (a ride to jail for me), and some time in the hospital, and she still loves me. She broke her leg, fractured her wrist, and got cut up from the glass, but she claims to still love me.
But she made me promise to never wax her downstairs again. |-| 
|-| cogq4lz || 22 || I don't mean to judge but after reading a role reversal of this situations it doesn't sound as funny. Thanks for writing and i hope you have a happy relationship but NO MEANS NO. STOP MEANS STOP. |-| 
|-| cogsdor || 15 || Pretty sure this would be rape if a man did it to a woman.

"She's said no but it's just going to be hilarious if I do it one more time" |-| 
|-| cogruim || 18 || Holy shit, this is the thing that least happened ever. I feel like a 15 year old girl wrote this in her creative writing class. |-| 
|-| cogv3k6 || 3 || What a hairy situation, I hope everything is smooth now.  |-| 
|-| cogxkb8 || 3 || As a hairy-chested guy myself, I don't know how I'd react if my girlfriend did this to me and I ended up through a window and broke things.

I'd be quite mad to say the least, especially after already telling her to stop.

You fucked up indeed. |-| 
|-| cogymac || 3 || That's horrific... what is wrong with you?

What would you guys think if roles were reversed.. |-| 
|-| coggig1 || 8 || The last paragraphs make me think it's a made up story, even though it's still funny. Nice one OP and be careful with your man next time. |-| 
|-| coge1bp || 10 || http://imgur.com/UcNEPYK |-| 
|-| cogkfo2 || 3 || So... As a lady, who gets waxed occasionally, I tend to take a mild NSAID before I wax. Also, long hair is not great to wax, trimming it, or shaving and letting it grow for 2-3 weeks works well. If there's a lot of blood, no go. |-| 
|-| coge9tr || 5 || I made it halfway through, checked the username, remembered what "defenestration" meant, and thought "uh-oh."
I was right |-| 
|-| cogg6c6 || 14 || You are a terrible person. He wanted you to stop and you did not give a shit. Reverse the situation. If you were bound to the bed and he bit your nipples or something. And you started to cry. Which makes him laugh and continue even harder. You then break out of the bondage thing and say stop I can not take it anymore I'm probably gonna pass out. And he does it again. How exactly would you feel? 

I do not know your situation but the guy should probably break up and if he does not want to you should. 
 |-| 
|-| cogmdt9 || 8 || &gt; He still loves me

He shouldn't.  |-|

In my head I imagine like an adolescent boy just whipping out his dick and saying "hey baby." |-| 
|-| cofyoxz || 8 || Mettez-le de suite, ou je vais le coupai.

There you go, OP. |-| 
|-| cogep5g || 4 || You should have said JIJ KOMEN HIER ZO PRATEN TEGEN MIJ ? |-| 
|-| cofzsxt || 16 || Firstly, I can only hope this doesn't reflect on the kids home life, but it probably does.
I cannot think of an approach that would help the kid.

But from your point of view, it's not wise to have physical contact with strange kids.
You opened yourself up to all kinds of malicious allegations. 
I'd have moved to another carriage. Far, far away. You have to protect yourself. |-| 
|-| coga3cl || 6 || As a mother myself you totally should have notified her, although can't say I think she would be concerned because no good mother just let's her kid out of sight anywhere in public, but what that little boy just did could be a sign he is being abused and with the mom not paying any attention it could be happening to that poor boy often!

He still had a tab open, and as I tapped on it to close it out, I noticed he was viewing some good 'ol porn. Apparently, my old man is into BDSM... more specifically-- Nipple torture. How can I ever look at him the same?  |-| 
|-| cogftpj || 4 || I guess you learned the hard way - don't go browsing people's phones, no matter how well you know them.

What's also annoying is when you pass your phone to your girlfriend's short sighted dad so he can squint at a photo on it, and he proceeds to start swiping back through the adjacent photos on your phone. I can guarantee he doesn't want to see his daughter the way I have so why does he do it!?!? |-|

As a young one I once sleepwalked out of my room, down stairs and watched tv curled up on a recliner - for hours until my parents found me.

Sometimes my dad would check on me after going to bed. He tells me when He would do this I would sometimes just sit up and stare back at him like a goddam vampire for a minute and then lay back down, not saying a word.

I also remember once sleepwalking into my sisters room, just looking at her sleep very close, then going back to bed. she was never the wiser. Creeped myself out that time. |-|

|-| coghv6l || 27 || Awesome, i'm sure you have some other good stories, I was a Dish Network tech for a while and I saw some shit. So much fun, miss those days honestly, my favorite was when I did a 4 room install at an older home. I informed the homeowner who was a female probably in her mid-late 50's that I had to run some cabling along her baseboard and under her bed, she said that was no problem and I started my work. 

Once I started running the cable I lifted the skirt to her bed and there was a cardboard box in my way, when I pulled the box out to run the cable underneath I saw like 10 dildos in there and my jaw dropped. I tried to shove the box back under quickly but she walked in right then and much to my dismay she didn't say a thing, she just stood there and watched me finish running the cable. Now that I think about it, that kinda makes me feel like I became a fantasy for her.... Hmmm. |-|

Sorry to be a dick, but Jesus Christ  |-|

|-| cogufgb || 13 || I so wish security cameras could have picked this up. This would be youtube gold. |-| 
|-| cogs03a || 19 || People want to hire people who can act normal, not circus clowns. I once heard that the guys who started Sony were courting some investors. They put on a party for them, dressed up like clowns, and gave the guys a great old time. They received compliments on the party. It had been great! they were told.

Later, when they visited the investors in their offices, they were politely told that there was no interest in investing with them to get their business started.  They commented, "but you seemed to like us so much during the party we gave for you!"

"Yes," one of them commented.  "But we want to invest in businessmen, not clowns."

I cannot imagine how you ever thought anything as stupid as this -- even if you had been successful -- would do anything other than convince those guys that you were a self-important prick who would do anything [stupid] to make an impression.

You, yourself, as a serious person, are much better and more important than any stunt.  Grow up. |-|

|-| coggp6n || 12 || Hah, I was living with my boss and his wife for a while a few years ago and had something similar happen. I sleepwalk sometimes after a night of heavy drinking, apparently I was looking for the bathroom in a drunken sleepwalking stupor however instead of the bathroom I walked into the master bedroom. I guess I freaked out his wife when I opened the door so she quickly cut the lights on, I was standing there in my boxers and my boss was like "wtf are you doing tmntnut?", to which I replied "not much, goodnight".

I then closed the door, made my way to the bathroom, relieved myself and went to sleep. I had a vague recollection of doing this however wasn't sure if it was a dream or not, my boss reassured me that it was in fact real the next day and continued to remind me on a regular basis after the fact.  |-|

|-| cogefe0 || 5 || You made a memorable impression with the heads of the school,  and probably the mirror,  you never know.  Sometimes all ur takes to get something is to be remembered |-| 
|-| cog9j5r || 29 || Sounds more like your friend was getting to 3rd base to me. |-| 
|-| cog9oot || 15 || This is why you shouldn't let a friend latch onto you like a koala at any given time.  |-| 
|-| coggtvz || 14 || A girl seeing your junk isn't first base.  It's neither second or third.  It's like, the bullpen or something. |-| 
|-| coga8mx || 7 || i would have punched my friend in the nuts like he did to your dignity. |-| 
|-| cog8v0v || 11 || &gt; He then proceeds to slid down, taking both my pants and underwear with him on his way.

Was that his intention or was it pure luck? Either way, I hope you aren't teased about this too much. |-|

|-| cogh1pc || 3 || Oh no! Poor guy, I hope you feel better. And as a woman I can give you a piece of advice. if you ever see this girl again, just Tell her you think she is very pretty and that any man would be lucky to date her. that makes you super polite and  she'll think of you the rest of the day :D |-|

|-| cogtlks || 3 || I am expecting updates. Work hard and impress her! I'm rooting for you! |-| 
|-| cognxls || 6 || That shht is def arbitrary.

I live near a hippie town which is infamous for its nudism &amp; which, IIRC, still has an active warrant for Bush &amp; Cheney. They are also the only community I know of which has a Comcast package made exclusively for their zip code. They are so particular about where &amp; how they spend their money that they would have no subscribers otherwise.


I have Time Warner. When I moved, they a) tried to sell me on a high speed connection for $60, which was maybe 12 over what I was paying and since I had a little lag during peak hours, sure whatevs. At some point I was told that the monthly total for my $60 package would be 70-odd dollars.  I was like, "nah, I'm good, I'll just keep the package I have." The guy literally  asked what I'd be willing to pay for the upgrade; I told him $60. He put me on hold for like 30 sec and then he came back on the line to let me know I could have it for $60. Okay... but... what the fuck even happened? 


B) they tried to tell me that it'd take a week to transfer my sevice. I pointed out that it took literally 24h for initial installation, and that they had verified that my new (now current) apt was set up for TW. I asked how long the lead time was for a new account setup; &lt;24h. Asked how long for the transfer; a week. K. I told them to go ahead and make the appointment, but that I'd probably be calling back shortly to cancel my service once I'd gotten an install appointment with another provider. Suddenly, there was no issue in having someone there for the transfer within a day or so. Again; great..but... whaaat? 



Honestly, the key to achieving your goal in any interaction like that is at least giving the impression of having all the time in the world to have the situation at hand resolved to your liking, and as OP said, not being a douchebag. Being a persistent yet polite pain in the ass with reasonable demands is incredibly effective. 

Also, "we" phrasing, *not* using words which make it seem like you hold the CS person responsible for all of their company's evils, and a friendly demeanor. Example: 
Instead of "You double-charged me for January, you need to fix it now," try, "I noticed that I was charged twice for January, what can we do to get this straightened out as quickly as possible?"

|-| cogjsmh || 12 || Comcast is the devil, and I'm Canadian. Ive seen enough sleezy stuff from them to think our cable deals arnt that bad afterall. |-| 
|-| cogisgn || 8 || Upvoted you before I even read the FU, because fuck Comcast. |-| 
|-| cogsnij || 3 || The trick is to start costing these companies more

a) I managed to fine Bank Of America over $100 for unauthorized charges they allowed

b) I managed to get about $150 out of Qwest/Centurylink for breaking their 99.999% uptime guarantee over a year (after which the fixed their kit which I told them was broken from day 1)

c) I made Bank of America deliver me a new CC in 1 day rather than 7 because they canceled it because they basically got hacked and lost the details to hackers

My next challenge is Waste Management who raised my bill from $80 to $105 in a month - pretty sure inflation is not that high |-| 
|-| cog44vb || 3 || lolz... So do you still get the credit for that? |-|

|-| cogtwfa || 6 || Is it bad that I thought this story was gonna end with a big pile of poop on dads head? |-| 
|-| cogrdxi || 5 || Poor kid, he's gonna wake up with pink eye isn't he. |-| 
|-| cogtrkr || 3 || Similar story happened to my brother a few years back except it was my cousin who was 8 at the time. My cousin farted in his face as he lifted him down from sitting on his shoulders. My brother carefully planned his revenge for when my cousin was brushing his teeth. Being 8 years old and a shorty, the bathroom counter was at his chest level. Well, my brother walked right behind him, pinned him against the counter with his butt and let 'er rip. That fart reverberated through his entire body. |-| 
|-| cogvpx1 || 3 || Wow. Saw the title and instantly though "aw man... The kid sharted!" Glad to read that it went differently! |-|
