roles in the regulatory process.

.

TTIP negotiations

will lower protection for consumers and the environment

.

TTIP will lower EU food safety rules, which are higher than those in the US.

TTIP will open a race to the bottom

.

TTIP will force the EU to allow the growing of genetically modified plants.

.

TTIP will force the EU to adopt lower animal welfare standards.

.

There will be more protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) – meaning medicines will be more difficult to get and more expensive.

.

TTIP could undermine the policy of the European Medicines Agency on releasing data from clinical trials.

|-| cnu0nh9 || 21 || Newly released Snowden documents show GCHQ was listening in the internal communications of some of the most prestigious journalistic institutions in the world. A report in The Guardian details a test exercise that resulted in emails from BBC, Reuters, The Guardian, The New York Times, Le Monde, The Sun, NBC, and The Washington Post all being deposited onto GCHQ's internal intranet, available to anyone logged into the system. It does not appear to have been an intelligence gathering exercise, and the resulting emails don't seem to have targeted any sensitive stories, but it still represents a major privacy violation and a reminder of how easily bulk collection systems can be abused.

The test was meant to demonstrate a new filtering tool meant to strip out irrelevant data from final results. Over the course of ten minutes, researchers pulled 70,000 emails directly from GCHQ's cable-tapping sites, then ran the experimental filter to see which of those messages could be surfaced as potentially valuable intelligence. Journalistic communications shot to the top of the list, although there's no evidence to suggest the journalists were intentionally targeted. The news comes at a particularly sensitive time, as Prime Minister David Cameron pushes for comprehensive new surveillance laws that could ban encrypted chat or email clients in the UK. |-|

&gt;* In the aftermath of the attacks, Iranian journalists who wanted to show solidarity with Charlie Hebdo were not allowed to hold rallies in Tehran.

&gt;* The Iranian government, in particular, has condemned the latest cover of the Charlie Hebdo, which showed a weeping Prophet Muhammad holding up a sign reading “Je Suis Charlie”, saying it was provocative and insulting to Islam.

&gt;* Iranian authorities have shut down a newspaper and suspended its licence after it published a front page depicting George Clooney at the Golden Globes alongside the headline “I am Charlie, too”.

|-| cnu3ka7 || -9 || Dr Arpad Pusztai evoked world wide media attention in August 1998, when he said in British TV that he would not eat genetically engineered food because of the insufficient testing procedures they have undergone.

Pusztai is a world renowned expert on food safety, who worked at UK's leading food safety research lab, the Rowett institute. His statement obviously threatened to damage the then ongoing multimillion PR campaign of the Biotech industry to create public confidence in GE foods. A few days after his public appearance he was suspended and gagged by the research institute where he worked.
  

Dr Pusztai's pointed out that substances in Genetically Engineered (GE) foods that have a slow acting effect would not be detected because present regulations do not require long term safety testing. The regulations prescribe an approval procedure based on the principle of substantial equivalence. In practice this procedure allows very superficially tested foods to be approved. As an illustrative example, he mentioned fresh results from his research on certain pesticidal Lectins (Pusztai is recognized as a world leading expert on Lectins). Pusztai found that rats developed immune system defects and stunted growth after a time period corresponding to 10 years of human life |-|

So people who support condom usage and birth control are Facists and Nazis... gotcha.

&gt;* The Church approves only natural methods of birth control, principally abstinence from sex during a woman's fertile period.

&gt;* The leader of the 1.2-billion-strong Roman Catholic Church restated its ban on artificial birth control, adding there were "many ways that are allowed" to practise natural family planning.

&gt;* In Sri Lanka and the Philippines, Francis condemned what he called an "ideological colonization" attacking traditional family values in developing countries.

|-| cnu7fzs || 27 || For the Catholic, sex is about the affirmation of the *goodness* of persons- of the *goodness* of human life. The man sees the body of the woman, and his sexual arousal tells him that her body and her existence is a good thing. Likewise in turn for the woman. Their act of sexual intercourse, which is an affirmation of the goodness of each others' existence, is capable of producing a new personal life (a child). Their affirmation of the goodness of human life actually creates another human life!! To deliberately withhold their fertility from each other through contraception changes the nature of the act, so that the act no longer says that human life is good, but that human life is something to be avoided. The act of sex becomes contradictory. Additionally, it is avoiding giving the total self to the other, which was promised in the wedding vows. In short, the sexual act no longer reflects the divine love which it was created in image of.

So any use of the sexual faculties that is done without the context of free (not rape or compulsory), total (no withholding fertility), and faithful (no adultery) love, is denying the objective character that God created it with. Contraception is wrong because it withholds a part of each person from each other during the sexual act, and it contradicts the intrinsic meaning of the sexual act (affirmation of the goodness of human life). Extramarital sex is wrong because it is not done within the context of a total pledge of one's life to the other (withholding a part of each person from the other). Masturbation is wrong because it is not done within the context of actually loving another person.

In short, if the sexual action of the person does not reflect the character of divine love, then it is immoral. |-|

|-| cnu9brz || 24 || TL:DR-- the Church explains it's belief on sex excellently through 
http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology_of_the_Body

Some good discussion here.  I get it if you're not down with the church. I don't blame you. With all the scrutiny the Church has come under and all the massive bullshit that it has been through and subjected people to over the past 2k years I'm piss as a Catholic as well.  

It's important to remember the church is made of people.  People who make mistakes. People who are evil. People who "want to watch the world burn." On the other side it is made of volunteers. People who are kind and generous. People who just want to follow one mans example of love.

That being said to understand this message of contraception you should really understand what the Church's message on sex really is. This can easily be found in Saint Pope John Paul's Theology of the body.

"The central thesis of John Paul's Theology of the Body, according to author Christopher West, is that "the body, and it alone, is capable of making visible what is invisible: the spiritual and the divine. It was created to transfer into the visible reality of the world, the mystery hidden since time immemorial in God, and thus to be a sign of it."[13]"  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology_of_the_Body

The message is to call us to be bigger than ourselves.  To devote ourselves to God and His message.  If that's not your bag, you don't believe, you think I and people of faith are crazy, that's absolutely fine.  That's why out of all the people on earth, not everyone is the same religion.  It's not for everyone.  But I'll love you just the same as a human not just because my faith calls me to that, but because its the right thing.

Sorry that kinda got out of control.

ID cards list a person's SEX not GENDER.

|-| cnum7pg || 3 || I'm Christian but I've never really gotten the hate religious folk have against birth control like condoms. There's absolutely no Biblical support against them and it just seems ludicrous especially when you're talking about sex between a married couple. As I believe it to be, sex was made by God to be beautiful between two people in love not just for procreation but also to keep those two together. But it's impractical and also dangerous as evidenced by nature for women to give birth every 9 months (considering how often humans desire sex).

Anyone be so kind as to shed light on why people have such beef with birth control like condoms? |-|

Why?

Because it pulls the veneer of respectable modernity off of the Islamic world in a way that cannot be denied. These guys have Muhammad on their side. They really do. They know their stuff. This is the stuff.

What that will do, I hope, is lead more Muslims to say, "Wait a minute. I didn't sign on for this shit. I just do my prayers, go listen to nice, community-minded speeches at the mosque, fast during Ramadan... But I am not down with killing people for watching soccer." This will, hopefully, lead more Muslims to follow Protestant Christianity's lead and start just disavowing the nasty parts of their religion, and for those who aren't even comfortable with that, to abandon religion entirely.

Islam is a barbaric religion. It is not the only barbaric religion; in fact, most religions are barbaric. But Islam has not gotten watered down enough to mitigate its barbarism, and that's the problem here.

Are you a Muslim? Congrats; these are your brethren. How do you feel about that? What are you going to do about it? |-| 
|-| cnumjop || 10 || It's just weird... 

A year ago he acknowledged that being gay or atheist wasn't against Catholicism, and in the Phillippines he said "the family is under attack", and referred to gay marriage as one of the culprits.

In the Philippines he said no contraception, now he says what... control your menstral cycles? 

The Pope has obviously run out of good things to say, so instead of just repeating and keeping a line and political vision, he caters to those that would vote for him. 

As an atheist, I almost started to believe he could be different from everyone else. But contradictory statements are the fashion these days, it seems. 

Or is it the news, that are blowing these reports out of context? so that his message of peace, and especially that about the inequality of wealth, doesn't ring so loud as the World Economic Forum looms.

Still, I'm not sure how I feel about this. When 9/11 happened I was in my first year of university. Our good neighbours to the south had been attacked, emotions were high and within weeks we joined them with a coalition of other forces in Afghanistan. Part vengeance, part deafeating this new evil 'Taliban' we'd just heard about I remember the sentiment was much like I'm reading in this thread. Overwhelming national pride. Excitement and, oddly surprise, that armed forces from a first-world G8 country would be so effective against dirt poor militia forces. "Go guys, give 'em hell and come home safe", "Fuck 'em up" etc. Then as the years dragged on, 9/11 became a memory yet soldiers from home continued to be killed by IEDs and talk became: Why are we still there? What's the exit strategy? When are we leaving?

So hear we stand, just over a decade later, faced with a new evil organization in ISIL and a few recent domestic terrorist incidents fueling a similar gungho 'git 'em' attitude with no clear mission statement, no end goal all in the same region. I wonder if we've learned anything and honestly struggle to see how this is different.

I'm glad some of you are have a good time chest thumping about how deadly our snipers are, I'd be lying if I said it didn't fill me with a little national pride, but in the end I'd rather only ask my fellow country men and women to risk their lives if I knew for certain the value.

|-| cnupjcw || 3 || It would be helpful if the Pope took a more practical look at the question of: is having lots of kids even a good idea anymore. The world is over populated as it is.

|-| cnupkt2 || 12 || This has to be one of the worst, most backward, and potentially damaging things this church blabbers about.  Can we please get over this "SEX IS THE DEVIL" crap from the pre-1600's already? Not allowing birth control is only going to lead to unwanted kids that end up on the street, the spread of STD's, and overpopulation in 3rd world countries that aren't intelligent enough to ignore half the BS churches around the world spew. 

Religion does do great things.  It helps bring communities together and gives hopeless people a purpose. Rules like this are damaging though. Stay out of people's sex lives, stay out of science, and stay out of politics.

&gt;* The number of tigers in India has seen a sharp rise to 2,226 tigers from just over 1,400 seven years ago, the environment ministry has said."India is now home to 70 per cent of the world's tigers," Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Tuesday.Karnataka has the most number of tigers at 406.

&gt;* Uttarakhand has 340 tigers, Tamil Nadu has 229, Madhya Pradesh has 208, Maharashtra has 190 and the Sundarbans in Bengal has 76 tigers.India has struggled to stop the rapid decline of its big cat population in the face of poachers, international smuggling networks and loss of habitat.From an estimated 100,000 tigers at the beginning of the 20th century, India saw the numbers dropping to 1411 in 2008.

&gt;* Most of the animals were killed by poachers who sell the carcasses for use in traditional Chinese medicine.In 2004, environmentalists were shocked when not a single tiger could be spotted at the Sariska wildlife reserve in Rajasthan, a top destination for big cat watchers.

In short they're winning, and to pretend otherwise is delusional. In the medium to long run we, the west, will have decide what to do. Either we accept that substantial parts of the Islamic world will come under the sway of the new caliphate and we isolate ourselves from them as best we can (including the expulsion of recalcitrant Muslim populations from Europe) or we commit to total war as against the Japanese/Nazis, and look for total victory and a forced reformation of Islam at the point of a gun. |-|

Over the past decade, he had lost his wife to lung cancer, lost a business and his house to bankruptcy and been forced to live in a public park for almost a month, according to Yukawa's father and an online journal he maintained.

Indira Gandhi was a huge tiger conservationist and helped increase the tiger population in 1947 from 1,400 to 4,000+ by the 80s using strict measures, but then poachers brought it back down. Also, I just wanted to add that they shouldn't try to expand the tiger everywhere *just yet*. Leave some forests open for the lions (and potential Asiatic cheetahs) to repopulate. Once the lion numbers start swelling in other parts of India, then they can allow them in with tigers in forests together. |-|

&gt;* An online video released Tuesday purported to show the Islamic State group threatening to kill two Japanese hostages unless they receive a $200 million ransom in the next 72 hours.The video, identified as being made by the Islamic State group's al-Furqan media arm and posted on militant websites associated with the extremist group, mirrored other hostage threats made the group.

&gt;* Goto is a Japanese journalist who went to report on Syria's civil war last year.The Islamic State group has beheaded and shot dead hundreds of captives - mainly Syrian and Iraqi soldiers - during its sweep across the two countries, and has celebrated its mass killings in extremely graphic videos.

&gt;* Japan's Foreign Ministry's anti-terrorism section has seen the video and analysts are assessing it, a ministry official said.

In 1995, an outbreak killed off 90% of gorillas in a national park in Gabon.

&gt;* The virus is even more deadly to great apes that it is for humans, with mortality rates as high as 95% for gorillas and 77% for chimpanzees.

&gt;* Ebola is currently the single greatest threat to the survival of gorillas and chimpanzees, having wiped out a THIRD of their populations since the 1990s.

|-| cnv4syv || 5 || This ongoing rebel offensive in many ways, a continuation of what the Arab state has seen since the establishment of a republican polity in 1962. 

The hyper-fragmentation of the country's political establishment since the ill-fated 2011 Arab Spring shows that the two decades that followed Yemeni unification in 1990 were an anomaly. 

Yemen seems to have reverted to its natural state, in which different geographic, sectarian and ideological forces are locked in a "balance of weakness" preventing the country from existing as a coherent polity.

The Yemeni condition represents the broad general trend within the Arab world that remains in the throes of autocratic meltdown, as seen in Libya and Syria. The states that remain standing — namely Saudi Arabia and Egypt — will likely face similar challenges of how to maintain their dominions in such an anarchic environment.

I have no love for Fox News, they've been French bashing for years and I have no problem with the mayor of Paris suing them. Even though it will probably lead nowhere and give Fox an excuse to go back to their French hating ways.


What bothers me here is that for years, the left in France of which mayor Hidalgo is a representative, stayed silent as many in the American media, not just Fox News, indulged in vicious French bashing.

French bashing and inaccuracies about France on Fox News are nothing new. Compared to some of the shit they said about France and the French this no go zones stuff is nothing

In other words the socialists and their friends in the media were ok with French bashing as long as Sarkozy, Chirac and conservatives were in power. They didn't say a fucking word when a lot worse was going on.

So yes better late than ever but they're also fucking hypocrites for not speaking out earlier. |-|

I don't know French law, but in the U.S., the press enjoys a near complete immunity when talking about the government. In other words, if this were to happen in a U.S. courtroom, it is a lost cause.

Under the first amendment, the press is allowed to criticize the government pretty much as much as they want. Yes, that includes objectively untrue statements. In fact, it would even include statements that were blatant, intentional lies. Remember, we're talking about statements about the government or a part of government in general, not specific people within the government.

If they were talking about a specific person (which they weren't), they may be opening themselves up to libel, but even then the rules are different when a public figure is in the works.

Further, even if they could sue, they would need to show some kind of damages, which is unlikely. If they're asking for a redaction from Fox News, done and done (and done and done and done), but otherwise they would have to show the damage to their reputation had a negative fiduciary impact.

|-| cnva3jn || -16 || I can't speak to the veracity of what Fox News said. They do, after all, have a proven record of lying through their teeth.

But now we're going to see yet another stupid backlash by people who believe the opposite of what Fox said, which is that Muslims are all lovely people, and anyone who is even slightly suspicious of any Muslim for any reason is a neo-Nazi who needs to be locked up in a cage and beaten with sticks like an animal. 

And of course, these people believe this because Fox News said the opposite, and when someone who you don't like says something then the opposite must be the truth.

Here's the actual truth: no, Europe is not "on the verge" on being completely overrun with Muslims, Birmingham is not a Muslim city, etc etc. 

However, that doesn't mean that Muslim areas are nice places to be or that Muslims in general are as peaceful and productive as westerners. Most of them openly despise their own host countries. They advocate for Sharia law. They shun science. They live off of public benefits while refusing to look for work. They commit crimes, particularly against their hated western benefactors, the very people who took them in in the name of universal tolerance and kinship (just look at how many Muslims are in European prisons versus native Europeans). They say that western women are sinful whores, which in Islam means having them gang raped and stoned to death. 

Don't kid yourself about Muslims, just because of Fox News' stupidity. They're no good for us, and that's exactly how they want it. 

We've been so tamed, so enfeebled by our foolish ideals of unconditional compassion and generosity that our foes openly taunt and threaten us in our own countries. And rather than retaliate against them, many westerners actually defend their treachery, and attack their own countrymen as mindless bigots. 

That is what people need to be thinking about, not what some money-grubbing cable news channel said about this or that.  |-|

Every time something about Fox News, the Daily Mail or heck, a black man telling the truth about his own people comes up, liberals move right away to discredit the source through all sorts of nasty, desperate means.

I learned a long time ago in college not to trust liberals. I came into school considering myself liberal. I soon was appalled at the behavior of many people on campus and grew to despise them. I think it was more about how nasty, unpleasant and unfriendly many of them seemed to be. Instead of telling people to stop creating problems for themselves, they did nothing but make excuses for them and give them a pass.

Once you look at everything from the perspective that these folks are closet communists, it makes perfect sense.

TL;DR- I'm an immigrant to this country, considered myself liberal, actually spent time around very hardcore liberals in college, realized how shitty, tyrannical and unfriendly they were, actually became conservative. |-|

|-| cnvawfh || -11 || A few flags in a small protest in Gaza about a contentious issue among some Muslims is not representative of ISIS sympathy across Gaza or all of Palestine.  

Actually, this is why attacking Hamas and pounding Gaza to ruble and killing scores of people and continuing the subjugation of the Palestinians is reprehensible and stupid if you want to see moderate positions prevail, because as the situation deteriorates and stagnates that only provides an environment for more virulent regional ideologies to take route in.  Hamas is not ISIS or Al Qaeda or the caricature Israelis push, and the alternative to Hamas is groups like Al Qaeda growing.  Hamas and Palestinians as a whole are not synonymous with ISIS as Israeli partisans are trying to now tie together. 

Israeli partisans are trying to slander the legitimate cause of the Palestinians with the actions of heinous groups like ISIS that other Muslims suffer from and who other Muslims, often allies of Palestinian groups, are engaged in fighting.  If all Muslims were identical to ISIS then such conflict would not exist at all, when it is the substance of what is occurring.  It is truly vile that many see an opportunity to use that suffering to tarnish the Palestinians in slander. You could also say that in addition to pushing a false rhetorical connection between the cause of the Palestinians to regional virulent ideologies, Israel has motivations to foment harsh ideologies among Palestinians themselves as that gives Israel rational to continue to treat and see them as subhumans and never step back from their continued reprehensible actions.

Oh, and meanwhile in the midst of the Syrian conflict, Israel is engaged in attacking Hezbollah and Syrian forces in Syria who are battling Jabhat Al-Nusra, which is Al Qaeda in Syria.  Israel is actually assisting Al Qaeda in wrecking Syria.  So, in action, Isreal is a friend indeed to groups likes these. |-|

As we have all witnessed, the U.S considers itself God status. Since absolute power corrupts absolutely, unchecked U.S power will continuously get more aggressive and tyrannical.

If there ever was a country to take the responsibility of calling the U.S out on their bullshit, it would be Russia. The U.S of course will do everything to see this doesn't happen... again. There are many other nations who see the importance of a multi-polar world, where the U.S is forced to play on a level playing field, who are actively working on this objective.

Ordinary Russians shouldn't take this personal. It's kind of like cornering a demon. It will spit and snarl every time. |-|

|-| cnvf6xo || 11 || This is from an interview conducted by a local newspaper (La Nacion, not aligned to the government) to a Professor in Balistics (my translation):

&gt; Deflagration is directly proportional to size or volume of the cartridge. A 22 caliber weapon is among the smallest on the market, and for that reason it is going to have much less deflagration than other weapons, as it combusts less powder.

&gt; On the other hand, it depends on the type of weapon. Each weapon has a different work method, a different bolting method, which is how it closes when (the gun is triggered).

&gt; On a revolver there's much more leaking chances as the chamber, being the cylinder, is not attached, there is a gap for it to turn. That's why there's a gas leak near the index finger.

&gt; On a pistol, on the other hand, chamber and cannon are a single piece, that's why there shouldn't be a leak if the weapon is in a good condition"

&gt; Depending on the state of the gun it allows [sic] a greater or smaller gasses leak. If it is in bad shape, deteriorated, there's a greater leak potential.

&gt; The analysis of a shot residue presence is another orientational proof, but not definite. The absense of residues does not mean the person has not shot. And a positive result does not mean a shot was done.*

Sorry for my rusty english. I'm in a rush and not really a translator :)

The famous "Hanoi Hilton" (where John McCain was help captive as a POW) is now a museum with pictures of POW's playing volleyball and enjoying turkey dinners.  It seemed like heaven! Man, they must have been bummed to leave.  No mention of the horrific torture they endured. 

Or at Khe Sanh, where the museum to anyone ignorant about the battle, would make you think that the Vietnamese scored a decisive and overwhelming victory while the Americans cowered in their bunkers. 

The point is that altering history in such a blatant and obvious way discredits a country for not owning up to its own past, even if it's dark.  |-|

They fucking hate yall for not even considering negotiations and bombing the shit out of their town while they had nothing to do with this bs. Seriously what the fuck people? You know, how come its OK to do this shit? How come Canada does not bomb Quebec and UK does not bomb Scotland. Because they are normal civilized countries, that's why. Ukraine and Russia are not. Russia bombed Chechnya, now Ukraine is bombing Donbass. Because rulers of Russia and Ukraine don't understand democracy, they just want all the power to themselves. So does this fuck Poroshenko - him, Putin and Yanukovich are all from the same gang. And yet you are bying this bs.

She looked at the kids who had made jokes about it. And though her voice shook and tears swelled in her eyes, she didn't cry as she told us all of how they'd done this first to her sister, and then to her.

“The organiser of a formal assembly shall electronically record audio and video of unedited speech or speeches made there, and submit a copy of such record to the officer in-charge of the police station (concerned).”

&gt;* The Ukraine government claims that about 700 Russian troops arrived in the country on Monday.

&gt;* If true, the video further undermines Russia’s denial it is providing soldiers to fight alongside pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.

&gt;* The rest of the broadcast does show images of Donetsk airport, which has been devastated by months of fighting.

It is only comparing "probability of a poor person moving out of poverty in India" with "probability of a poor person moving out of poverty in United States".

Only the upward and downward mobility of people in India are being discussed here - so this is useful only for comparing the opportunity for breaking out of poverty available in both countries - not for comparing income, quality of life or any other metric. 

Between 2004 and 2010, 40% of India's poor (15% of total pop.) moved above the poverty line - what was significant was that urbanization was found to be reducing inequality in India (contrary to the conventional understanding that urbanization was increasing inequality).   |-|

Life expectancy has more than doubled, literacy rates have quadrupled, health conditions have improved. India will soon have the largest and youngest workforce the world has ever seen. At the same time, the country is in the midst of a massive wave of urbanization as some 10 million people move to towns and cities each year in search of jobs and opportunity. It is the largest rural-urban migration of this century. Massive investments will be needed to create the jobs, housing, and infrastructure to meet soaring aspirations and make towns and cities more livable and green.

They had documentaries where Japanese reporters took horrible photos from the two bombings and show it to the American veterans, who were all regretful and sorry in shame.

When the Chinese and Koreans show their proof for anything the Japanese did during the war, the Japanese pass it off as fake evidence and that they were CGed.

I was heavily influenced by the Japanese pop culture and moved to Japan eight years ago, naive and gullible. Seriously though, most of their younger generations don't even care about the history, and the older generationi will deny everything horrible they did.

That's not to say that Russia isn't heavily involved in the Ukrainian conflict, of course, because there's a ton of evidence that it is. For example:

* According to an article in the Guardian, family members of deceased Russian soldiers are saying they died in Ukraine, and soldiers who refuse to "volunteer" are fired from the military. ([source](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/19/russia-official-silence-for-families-troops-killed-in-ukraine))

* In an interview with the Financial Times, Russian soldiers in Lugansk said they were made to volunteer. ([source](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/76bac354-59c2-11e4-9787-00144feab7de.html))

* Last year, a squad of Russian paratroopers was captured in Ukraine. ([source](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28934213))

* In separatist videos that featured Chechen fighters, a BTR-82A appeared. This is a fairly new Russian military vehicle that is only used by the Russian and Kazakhstani militaries. ([source](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=5c3_1408209457))

* A number of Russian tanks were spotted in Ukraine. ([source](http://www.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/2sotqu/amazing_job_120_russian_tanks_on_donbass_spotted/))

* Several western journalists spotted Russian military vehicles crossing the border with Ukraine. ([source](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/14/russian-military-vehicles-enter-ukraine-aid-convoy-stops-short-border))

However, this particular image appears to be misleading.

You know: ‘Ukraine doesn’t care about you, but Russia does’. I think that’s been a problem.”"

|-| cnvwm5r || -6 || I hate the assumption life must exist outside of Earth. The assumption should always be that there is no life. Even Earth, which has every possible condition for life still only had it once, and all life descended from it. If life were common, then a place like Earth should have rampant abiogenesis, but it doesn't. The universe is the antithesis of life, matter barrels at thousands of miles an hour into itself, explodes, boils, freezes, irradiated, pelted with cosmic rays, and smashed and pulled by gravity.

The universe doesn't want life. And when suns are born and die on a cosmic clock the odds that life would exist at the same time, or even more unlikely actually come in contact with one other, is incredibly unlikely.

We will never find alien life.  

And if we are looking the key is a Van Allen Belt. The universe puts out an incredible amount of radiation which makes life difficult, and little baby cells can't handle it because it wrecks genes. |-|

&gt;* Micro-CT scans of two rolled scrolls revealed their interior structure—a mass of delicate whorls akin to a fingerprint.

&gt;* "With the text now accessible by virtue of specialized images, we have the prospect of going inside the rolled scrolls, and that's really exciting," says Macfarlane.

&gt;* During excavations there in 1752, diggers found a villa containing bundles of rolled scrolls, carbonized by the intense heat of the pyroclastic flows and preserved under layers of cement-like rock.

This seems more like an excuse for the Pakistani government and army to gain more power over the population.

|-| cnvx7rd || -5 || It should be noted that the definition of poverty was changed in India just last year.  While inflation is making everything ridiculously expensive for the poor, they were being told that they aren't poor anymore because they are now above the poverty line (which is no-where near where it needs to be).  It makes the statistics look good, but does nothing for poor people.  It's all good and well to say "look there are now 50 million less poor people because India is doing well", but it's another to actually get those people the necessities of life.

Statistics are for suckers, everyone who has ever been in a management position knows how easy it is to skew the real picture with fancy statistics tricks. |-|

But it does survive -- and thrives -- because there are enough people out there who remain persistently stupid enough day to day to allow it to remain a going concern. You can't litigate against that kind of idiocy, no matter how right you are. Even if you could somehow put the touch on Fox through legal means, you can't touch the pure idiocy that fuels it from beneath. The enemy here is not Fox, odious and shameless as they are. The real enemy is something much bigger, deeper, and darker, and far more insidious -- simple human stupidity on a grand scale,.

http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/01/ecbs-momentous-meeting

&gt;But a big bond-buying programme is tricky in a monetary union where there is not one federal government but 19 national ones, of widely varying creditworthiness, ranging from triple-A for Germany’s to junk for Greece’s. The indications are that Mr Draghi will have to bow to stipulations set by Jens Weidmann, head of the German Bundesbank, if he is to get QE approved. Most notably, purchases of sovereign debt will not be made under the usual risk-sharing arrangements at the ECB, whereby the 19 national central banks of the euro zone share any losses in rough proportion to the size of their economies. The Bundesbank would normally expect to shoulder a quarter of any losses incurred by the ECB. But in this instance, each central bank is likely to be largely responsible for buying the bonds of its own country and will have to bear any losses on them on its own.

So Germany buys its own triple-A bonds, but the central banks of some other EU members will be on much more tenuous ground.  It will also likely dampen the positive effects of QE overall for confidence reasons. |-|

Had they all shrugged off Hamas they would have had their Palestinian state by now. Hamas does not care about Palestine or Palestinians.

Say what you will about Israel but they build bunkers and they invest in missile defense. Why? Because they give a shit about their people.

If your people don't have basic infrastructure, stable schools (beyond what the UN provides) and your first move is to use donation dollars to fund a war effort and to build tunnels for missile attacks....you don't care about your people.

Hamas is invested in war and in bloodshed. Palestine deserves better and they would have likely had their peace agreement had they told Hamas to go fuck themselves years ago. |-|

Quick primer for those who don't know/don't understand:  Edit:~~The Taliban~~ *Taliban's situation is more complicated, they're not directly Salafist, they're Deobandi - that said, the two are similar*, Al Qaeda, Boko Haram, and a huge number of other *really nasty groups* all subscribe to a particular branch of Sunni Islam called Wahabism/Salafism (two names, same meaning - they don't like Wahabi as a name because it references the guy who came up with the school of thought IIRC).  In short, they're violent, backwards mofos.  The Saudi Royal Family also subscribe to this form of Islam - it's the official state religion in Saudi Arabia.  Connecting the dots from there, especially when you read a few articles on about these folks, is pretty easy.

Don't take my word for it, go look this stuff up.

|-| cnxd03m || 33 || ITT: Not economists.

The real effects of quantitative easing are widely debated among economics of all schools of thought. At the end of the day though, economics, being a social science, can really only be studied by looking at history.

Forget the fact that central banks, wages and inflation are themselves as modern as concept as the car; quantitative easing is strictly a 21st century phenomenon. It is just this weird tool that central banks have tried to use to remain useful in a depression, when conventional monetary policy has lost traction.

If you agree that central banks are good, and that by controlling the money supply its actions can be effective in promoting high employment, stable prices, growth, or all three, then we simply cannot have at least 75% of the comments that I see in this thread. Quantitative easing is not fundamentally different from regular open market operations--it buys assets to increase the money supply.

As it stands the EU faces the grave risk of entering the dreaded deflationary spiral. Like most if not all central banks, it is in the ECB's mandate to maintain 2-3% inflation (so, this action can be justified on no further grounds than it is the legal obligation of the EU to do so). Inflation is currently around zero. [Why is this bad?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation) Well, why would you buy today what you could buy cheaper tomorrow? Conversely, this is why moderate inflation can have expansionary effects.

You're entitled to your opinion about inflation (an immensely complicated and debate issue, I can assure you) or central banks, but do us all a favor and type at least one sentence justifying your position. "Those rich fuckers" or "this is why we need a Universal Basic Income" is not a position on quantitative easing. |-| 
|-| cnxd2wq || 4 || But graven images are totally cool |-| 
|-| cnxd3za || 9 || There is a central issue that economists are not looking at and that the recent recession is actually a completely different beast than the recessions we usually deal with. When you have negative interest rates and you are still pumping money into the economy and its not working you have a huge issue. The issue that is often overlooked is the fact that we have a balance sheet recession. No one is borrowing money... and when no one is borrowing money it doenst matter how much money you pump into the system or how cheap you make credit businesses are still trying to balance their balance sheets from the recession and have no interest in borrowing more money to increase there already existent debt liabilities.

If you are interested in an alternative view of the situation and why its completely bogus look at these videos

They were destroyed by Christian mobs.  Why can't Irish practice the Ancient Religion?  Because it was suppressed by Catholic Church written laws for centuries.  So, who took this statue?  The artist is clueless as he talks about the resale value, and the difficulty of taking the work down.  Has he learned so little about religion as he resurrected  a pagan god?  Are their any intolerant religious Christians in Northern Ireland?  The BBC is not sure.  It's as if the article writer is not really interested in news.  Why do these people become reporters if they are not curious.  Couldn't a computer app write this flavorless pointless drivel?   |-|

We must ease tensions and bridge the gap between East and West through mutual respect.

As an addendum, I'd like to say the main contribution of the Anglo-Americans was stopping communism from conquering all of Europe. This was hugely important and prevented the fall of liberty in the west. |-|

Sisi is the western-approved military representative. He represents the authoritarian overthrow of a popular revolution, and the Egyptian deep state. As such, we would be wise to remember who pulls his strings - the military and the western governments. 

So long as the western states continue to wage war on the muslim world, poor Muslims are going to find the words of radical Islamist preachers resonant. The west cannot continuously invade for 100 years, extracting the wealth of nations while imposing brutal puppet regimes, and expect no response. 

Radical Islam is 1) funded by the west. 2) distributed by the puppet state of Saudi Arabia under US approval. 3) Aimed at destabilizing the region and creating horrific civil wars. 4) only appealing because of the century-long western state invasion. 

Stop fucking these poor people and stealing everything of value from their states, while indoctrinating them into radicalism, and the problem of radical terrorism would not exist.  |-|

 in June, ISIS became the leading global terror organization. It surpassed al-Qaeda central by inspiring tens of thousands to join its ranks and many more to commit acts of terrorism on their own. The Jewish Museum of Belgium shooting in May 2014, the Sydney hostage crisis in December 2014, the attacks in France, and the plot to blow up the U.S. Congress earlier this month – all were inspired by ISIS." |-|

I come from a small town in Eastern Poland and we have [this](http://www.google.pl/imgres?imgurl=http://podziemiezbrojne.blox.pl/resource/dziwy03.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://podziemiezbrojne.blox.pl/2011/07/Dziwy-na-cmentarzu-postscriptum-do-Apelu-9-maja.html&amp;h=390&amp;w=520&amp;tbnid=v2zksaKVA2H7KM:&amp;zoom=1&amp;docid=R8Qn4eLiqL8reM&amp;ei=C1HBVJCvCMuAywPM7oLgDA&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=0CCEQMygBMAE) which is basically a cementary of Red Army Soldiers who fought in Poland. It's always been a tranquil place for me although if [this article](http://wpolityce.pl/polityka/112967-o-czekistach-ktorzy-przezyli-swoja-smierc-czyli-dziwy-na-cmentarzu) is correct (unfortunately only in Polish) it tells a sad story of 2147 people majority of which fought the Nazis when the frontline moved and the rest being part of a political machine of oppresion of any Polish resistance that followed the army. Basically a story of Red Army coming into Poland - a lot of heroes in the front followed by a bunch of [chekists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheka) and other scum. *Fun fact - the guy that created the Cheka was Polish*.The source is sometimes deemed as biased but it is well written. 

Basically, us and the Soviet Union was always a complicated story.

Back to the point - when I was young, my imagination often went to all these Red Army soldiers that died in a foreign land, far from home, fighting Nazi Germany. Yeah - probably there were bad people there as well - but most of them wanted to defeat the Nazis and free our brothers Slavs of the Nazi scourge. That was clear for me. It was simple thinking but simple works when you're 15/16. The names on the graves IIRC are Ukrainian, Russian and I believe there are also Gerogian and Tatar names there. Guys that I believe wanted to fight the Nazi machine and who sincerely believed that it was the right thing to do. And I was somehow grateful to these specific individuals for that.

And now 60 years later this fucking clown comes in and basically slaps Russians, Georgians, Tatars, Belorussians in the face saying that it was *exclusively* Ukrainians that liberated Auschwitz. I know a few Ukrainians and all of them know it wasn't true. Yeah, they were there, the Russians were there, hell - the Polish were also there.

And now we have a guy that's making an unnecessary statement and it reminds of a dog that can't really bite because he's too small but at least he'll bark. 

Why do it? It's untrue, unjust and simply stupid to say shit like this. And to say it for some kind of political benefit to ride on the anti-Russian climate.

I am at a loss for words. And that's when I remembered the cementary and felt ashamed that my government is trying to use an ultimate sacrifice as a tool to bite contemporary Russia in the ass.

It's shameful.

EDIT: To all the commenting - in a more or less civil way - thanks for the discussion. And yes, I remember Katyń, Miednoje, Charkow. I remember Volhyn massacres and Chmelnickij uprisings. I remember when the Swedes stole a fuckload of Polish art in the XVII century. I remember the Mongols, Teutonic Knights and so on. A lot of nations fucked (or tried to fuck us up). On the other hand I remember Operation Vistula, Zaolzie, Polish armies in Moscow at the times of Great Smuta and other fucked up things that we did. But I will not be sitting in my comfy chair trying to assess who should I trust less - Russians, Ukrainians, Germans, Swedes, Turks or Mongols. I am all for making the situation in Ukraine better (as in finding a solution for people to stop killing each other) but my point was that comments like this from our FM make me feel ashamed. There's nothing to be won here, maybe a sense of "don't mess with us or we'll make your war veterans feel bad". And then people in Poland wonder why aren't we invited to any negotiations and we're not being treated as partners in any talks regarding Ukraine.

But yeah, we can all just assume that nations in general are bloodthirsty and hate every individual claiming to be a part of such nation.  |-|

|-| cnxkjsv || -3 || Back in the frontier days, a westbound wagon train was lost and low on food.
No other humans had been seen for days, when finally they saw an "Old Jewish Man" sitting beneath a tree. The leader rushed to him and said, "We're lost and running out of food. Is there someplace ahead where we can get food?

"Vell," the old Jew said, "I vouldn't go up dat hill und down other side. Somevun told me you'll run into a big bacon tree."

"A bacon tree?" asked the wagon train leader.

"Yah, ah bacon tree. Trust me. For nuttin vud I lie."

The leader goes back and tells his people that if nothing else, they might be able to find food on the other side of the next ridge.

"So why did he say not to go there?" some of the pioneers asked.

"Oh, you know those Jews -- they don't eat bacon."

So the wagon train goes up the hill and down the other side. Suddenly, Indians attack and massacre everyone except the leader, who barely manages to escape back to the old Jew, who's enjoying a "glassel tea."

The near-dead man starts shouting, "You fool! You sent us to our deaths! We followed your instructions, but there was no bacon tree! There was hundreds of Indians, who killed everyone."

The old Jew holds up his hand and says "Oy, vait a minute." He then gets out an old English-Yiddish dictionary, and begins thumbing through it. "Gevalt, I made myself ah big mistake. It vuz not a bacon tree.

It vuz a ham bush!" |-|

&gt;* The bulletin has included climate change in its doomsday clock since 2007.

&gt;* 

But Benedict did acknowledge the group has been warning of imminent nuclear disaster with its clock since 1947 and it hasn't happened yet.

&gt;* Barack Obama will not meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he visits in March to speak to Congress, the White House says.

&gt;* Mr Obama believes new measures will be harmful to negotiations over Iran's nuclear programme, talks Mr Netanyahu has opposed.

&gt;* 

Mr Netanyahu is fighting a tough election against the Labor Party's Yitzhak Herzog, who has focused on the prime minister's cooler relations with Mr Obama.

It will cause the temporary feeling that things get better. Like now, in US, most people feel that economy is up, people get mortgages and buy houses again, began to fly much more, spend money more easily, and in a year or two it will be another crisis. Inflation will rise, prices will go up, and the cycle will come back.

You just can't solve problems by just printing money. If that was a good solution, why did they stop QE in US? Why didn't they print 10 times more?

I wrote a bit about this if anyone's interested. A bit of background.  |-| 
|-| cnxqj8r || 55 || Great, now we have two separate (and possibly conflicting) American foreign policies, one set by Obama's White House and one being orchestrated by Boehner and his Republicans. NOTHING COULD GO WRONG. |-| 
|-| cnxqj94 || 9 || New king and his heir:

Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud.

Some background: Prince Salman is well regarded as intelligent and hard-working. He is a trusted mediator in settling royal conflicts among the extended Al Saud – estimated at 4,000 princes. His administration of Riyadh Province was reportedly corruption-free. He is a prominent figure of the royal council, which allows him to select which princes will be delegated which responsibilities of the Kingdom.

**One of his sons became the first person of royal blood, the first Arab, and first Muslim to fly in outer space** when he flew aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-51-G) in June 1985.

Prince Salman is also possibly suffering from **dementia** and **alzheimers**.


The new heir to the throne is Muqrin bin Abdulaziz.

Prince Muqrin studied at the Riyadh Model Institute. He, then, went to **Britain's RAF College in Cranwell** and graduated with a degree in aeronautics at the rank of flight lieutenant in 1968. He also received a diploma, equivalent to a master's degree, from the General Staff course in the **US** in 1974.

Muqrin bin Abdulaziz is believed by many to be a **liberal** within the family. However, letter exchanges regarding the Shia in the Eastern province illustrated an interesting opposition between him and late Crown Prince Nayef. The letters discussed how a situation involving Shia instigation in the Eastern Province should have been handled. In these exchanges, **Prince Muqrin argued for a much stronger and harsher approach**, but was vetoed by late Crown Prince. |-| 
|-| cnxqjr4 || 23 || If only this could bring change to the region but it surely will not. At least we can be thankful that there will be no power vacuum and it will be business as usual in Saudi. One can only hope that somehow his imprisoned daughters are treated better in his absence.  |-|

|-| cnxr9jz || 5 || He's beheading angles, now. |-| 
|-| cnxrci1 || 90 || There seems to be a lot of discussion about whether he is good or bad.

Relative to most people in Saudi Arabia, he would be considered very liberal and a reformist. He was actually criticized for allowing women to obtain scholarships to study abroad. He was very anti-extremism. The problem in my opinion is that he was too old, very ill, and the reforms needed to be expedited. If he was younger, there probably would've been better changes in Saudi Arabia; unfortunately, the succession in Saudi Arabia is kinda dumb and it is inevitable that there would be a series of kings that are old as fuck.

Read about him as king on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_of_Saudi_Arabia#King_of_Saudi_Arabia |-| 
|-| cnxrdks || 6 || It is too bad he is senile. Read his Wikipedia page.

&gt;"the pace and extent of reforms depend on social and cultural factors, ... that for social reasons—not [religious] reasons—reforms cannot be imposed by the [Saudi government] or there will be negative reactions, ... [and] that changes have to be introduced in a sensitive and timely manner." According to the cable, he said that "democracy should not be imposed" in Saudi Arabia, since the country "is composed of tribes and regions and if democracy were imposed, each tribe and region would have its political party."

That is from the cable leaks. He gets it better than most Americans. |-|

|-| cnxs50v || 10 || Just wanted to point out that some of the things King Abdullah was striving for was to lessen Saudi's reliance on oil, something that reddit incessantly loves to talk about. The two major things he worked on was the saudi scholar ship program in the past five years which focused on sending ten thousands saudi students to study abroad (fully paid scholarship too) so they could come back and benifit the country with education. 

The other is the King Abdullah Economic City which you can read about here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Abdullah_Economic_City as the plan is to jump start trading in the middle east 

If neither of those work, then maybe his successors will teach the Saudi's the secret art of pigeon catching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CqWatbKwRI

In August 2010, Prince Salman underwent spine surgery in the United States and remained out of the kingdom for recovery. He had one stroke and despite physiotherapy, his left arm does not work as well as his right. After his appointment as Crown Prince various analysts including Simon Henderson argue that he is suffering from dementia. In addition, he is believed to be suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

&gt;* Breedlove said he could not confirm Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's estimate of 9,000 Russian troops in eastern Ukraine.

&gt;* High-level military contact between Russia and NATO used to take place regularly until Russia's intervention in Ukraine.

&gt;* Breedlove told a news conference after a meeting of NATO defense chiefs that military leaders would try to re-establish contact with their Russian counterparts, broken off amid tensions over Ukraine.

Society really needs to step up and outlaw these barbaric rituals and have real consequences for breaking the laws.  Not just paying some fine or whatever.  If you cut off someone's penis without consent, you, your husband/wife, and your doctor should all have your genitals completely removed.  And it needs to be an automatic sentence, with NO EXCEPTIONS, no appeals no court case etc.

|-| cnxuumc || 2653 || This is going to be an interesting few years for Saudi Arabia. King Abdullah was considered a reformer - his brother and predecessor, King Fahd, was a conservative who drove Saudi Arabia far deeper into Wahhabi Islam, in order to appease the clerics. King Abdullah, on the other hand, pushed quietly for a lot of reform for females and tried to reverse a lot of the change the hard-line conservatives in the country did during his predecessor's reign.

There are a LOT of people who don't quite understand the dynamic between the Saudi people and the Saudi government - an absolute monarchy - and why blaming splitting/spurning Saudi Arabia could hurt us a lot more than trying to keep reforms in Saudi Arabia going. The following is a bit of a history lesson, but very relevant to the struggle going on there.

First, we must go back to December 1979, a pivotal month year in modern Islam.

At the end of 1979, Islamists seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca, during the hajj, when millions around the world came for pilgrimage. Hundreds of pilgrims were taken hostage - hundreds died and the ringleaders were beheaded.

That same December, Ayatollah Khomeini officially became the 1st Supreme Leader of Iran. In doing so, his revolution had successfully created a Shia theocracy in Iran, a rival of the Arabs and in particular Saudi Arabia.

Also in December of 1979, the Soviet Union, an atheist state, invaded Afghanistan, an Islamic state.

Why do all of these tie in together?

For one, the Saudi royal family sees themselves as the caretakers of Mecca and Medina - a sort of royal protector of Islam like an Islamic Vatican State. In Iran in 1979, however, there was a new rival in both culture (Arabs vs Persian), religious sect (Sunni vs Shia), and now in government (monarchy vs theocracy). Note that many hardline Islamists do not believe that monarchies can exist in strict Islam - as thus, the Saudi royal family was nothing more than a western, imperialist creation that was ultimately un-Islamic. Furthermore, the agreement they've had with the US for protection (established by FDR during WW2 actually, after he met with the founder of Saudi Arabia, in exchange for logistics bases for the war) was seen as a mortal sin - dealing with an infidel country.

The Saudi family feared that Iran would become a model for the commoners to rise up. The Saudi populace is very conservative and while the Saudi royal family has been famous for its debauchery and westernized living (especially abroad), for the most part the population had been quiet. The Seizure of the Grand Mosque, however, sent a shockwave through the Saudi family - they were not immune. They feared they too would be toppled by an Iranian-style revolution by those who deemed them not Islamic-enough.

As thus, the Saudis embarked on appeasing the hardliner clerics with more strict laws, a tougher moral police, etc. Prior to all this, Saudi Arabia didn't have such strict laws as requiring women to be covered in public, foreign females could drive legally, etc. In exchange, the clerics continued the agreement to legitimize the Saudi family.

Furthermore, the Soviet invasion was an unexpected boon - the Saudi government encouraged young Islamist-leaning males to go fight in holy jihad against the atheist commies and defend Islam in Afghanistan. Also, many Saudi citizens donated money to establish mosques in Pakistan and Afghanistan to preach their ideology and send more fighters against the Soviets. All of this was welcomed by the Saudi government -this relieved a lot of the pressure internally as those fighters and money went away from funding fundamentalists internally.

Where did it all go wrong? Well, fast forward to 1991 and the Gulf War. When Saddam invaded Kuwait, Osama bin Laden - through his family connections - petitioned the Saudi king to let him and his hardened fighters in Afghanistan come and fight the Iraqis.

The Saudi King refused - instead, he requested the US and an international coalition come help. The Saudis volunteered their soil for US bases.

To Osama, this was the last straw - the Saudi King let an infidel army establish bases on the holiest soil in Islam. In turn, Osama declared war not just on the US and the west - but also on the Saudi government and its royal family.

This is why all the talk about removing our support from Saudi Arabia, etc. simply isn't going to happen. Yes, most of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi citizens - but the Saudi government itself has been under attack by people of those same ideologies. The Saudi government has had to play a balancing act between its western-leaning royal family and the hardliner citizens that make up its population.

This is also why we need the Saudi government to come aboard in cracking down harder on its citizens - after a string of attacks in the 90s and 2000s, they finally came to a realization that they had to do something and it's made a lot of headway in the fight against Islamists.

And that's why Saudi Arabia has supported toppling Gaddafi (because he's a clown) and Assad (because he's an ally of Shia Iran), whether there are Islamist rebels or not -- its radical citizens have a place to go wage jihad away from home  -- but also has supported toppling Morsi (because he's a hardline Islamist) and re-establishing the secular rule of the Egyptian military.

(Yes, I know much of this is very simplified, but it should provide a big picture to what's going on with Saudi Arabia)

Bear in mind that during these years, Stalin was engaged in a systematic ethnic cleansing of Ukrainians.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge

Something like 1 million dead humans murdered directly by Stalin in two years, in Ukraine.  Torture was of course used all throughout Stalin's reign as a tool to keep Ukraine in it's place.

Numbers are impossible to pin down because of the fog of war and the years passing, but most historians would say that Hitler was directly responsible for around 30 million dead.  Stalin was responsible for around 40 million dead.  

I'm not here to blame any side, but the history is there for anyone to see.  And what's also there to see for anyone watching is Putin's admiration for Stalin and the USSR, and his eagerness to place idols of Stalin all over the Russian Orthodox/Kremlin dictatorship he has created.

You can say what you want, but that's my side of the story, and I'm very grateful for his attempts to revolutionize Saudi. 

9 years ago, guys weren't allowed to enter malls without a "female," as single men without families were considered to be disruptive and uncomfortable to be around in outlets. That changed. 
9 years ago, women weren't allowed to be members of the parliament. 
9 years ago, Saudi had 47 colleges and universities. Now Saudi has 76. 
He built 6 medical cities, funded 11 private hospitals and 32 public hospitals, funded railroads and sport academies. 
People in Saudi are genuinely nicer because of him. 

I lived here, and I saw him revolutionize this country. Perhaps not to the extent where outsiders can consider "revolutionary," but to Saudis, there might never be a monarch like him.

|-| cny5pvd || 12 || Hello to all Australians and Americans with a fact you should know.

David Hicks was defended by an Australian citizen. Who was that 'God' of an Australian citizen? Major Mori of the US Marines. He was not an Australian citizen at the time but is now. I am stunned by this man's dedication to truth and justice and saddened that he also suffered for being the sort of person we all should be.

There is a stunning quote from Robert Penn Warren.
“Goodness . . . You got to make it out of badness . . . Because there isn't anything else to make it out of.”.  That is what he did.

Mr Mori is an inspiration to me. The pressure from, the Australian Government (tx little Johnny), the US Government, his command, Gitmo, his family, relatives ...and on and on it must have gone and been horrendous but he did the right thing.

To think that a US Marine fought against all that, well now I know why the Marines are considered real men. Then he felt an unworthy dump like Oz would be worth his time, after all we did to him.

I know the area he frequents and it is with strong resolve that I haven't dumped $100 at a Cafe counter and said 'Free coffee's to the God'. I truly hope he is sick of people doing that to him.

This is now an old thread and my post may not get much traction, however it is a throwaway because I feel it should be upvoted to all Gitmo and I don't deserve to tailcoat on a God.

|-| cny5wsp || 10 || This is weird but I have to write this about the guy.

I remember when I was a kid, there was a report on the news on national television (I'm from Poland) about this little girl suffering from some kind of a rare disease (sorry for being so vague, but this was years ago). The treatment was super expensive, and basically the prospects for this girl weren't great. This guy heard about it and funded the treatment. There were interviews with her parents, expressing gratitude, and he even came to visit.

And this is the part that got to me: at the end of the clip there was a brief footage from the airport. This man, all dressed up, looking very aristocratic and majestic as fuck walking towards his private jet with a few other guys dressed in white. The girl was there with her parents, and as the guys were about to board the plane she all of a sudden ran directly to him. He turned around VERY quickly, picked her up and hugged her.

I guess it was such a striking image because in a millisecond he transformed from a strange billionaire wearing drapes to a genuine, good and caring guy who saved this girls life. Rest in peace.

EDIT: I checked it and just to clarify, Abd Allah ibn Abd al-Aziz as-Saud funded a very difficult and expensive (1.5 million dollar) operation of dividing Polish siamese twins: Olga and Daria from Janików. Operation took 18 hours. In 2007 the king was awarded Order of the White Eagle which is Poland's highest decoration. |-| 
|-| cny5y6d || 4 || I agree, the big question is if the privacy is mutual or not. If you distribute the personal information of one person and not of others, then in a hypocritical way, private information can be used to discredit a person. All information freely available (old school hacker style) isn't necessarily problematic.   
As reddit shows, the reality on many things is extremely different from the image we have created by using privacy to hide our socially unacceptable truths.   
When these truths come out, we'll have to think about reshaping the boundaries of trust and cooperation and hopefully we will acknowledge and share our weaknesses, rather than use them as a source for conflict trying to downplay our bad points and pointing out the bad points in others. We will have to move from a blaming society to a society that accepts diversity and helps battle each others' weaknesses together.

Our president and his administration are engaging in talks RIGHT NOW attempted to find common ground and build up diplomacy. And john boehner is really going to bring in the biggest threat to iran, Israel's prime minister to try and destroy the peace process? Listen Benny, you got your billions this year like you always do, you got white phosphorous since you dropped it on large metro areas and burned a bunch of women and children to death, you can get back on your plane alone and deal with the wars you instigate on your own.

There are probably many other things but these are what I know of. All my respects to the land of giant, well written vikings.

|-| co98qgw || 12 || When I was in Iceland this fall our guide who was a Norse Pagan suggested the popularity of the "pagan church" in Iceland has as much to do with frugality as with an interest in maintaining their cultural roots. Apparently there is no separation of church and state the way Americans think of it. Taxes collected by the State go to the churches through some equation related to number of adherents so there's no such thing as "non-state owned church". The Christian churches have a lot of overhead; the clergy, the buildings, ceremonies as so on. The Norse pagan church had none of these things so not only is it very affordable for regular folks to get married for example but they also can donate all their dues to good causes, which at the time was the Icelandic Search and Rescue.

|-| co9kk19 || 4 || This is great. It's important to have architecture to represent the diversity of religious faiths and it becomes a crucial issue when you get into the details that follow from it. 

So take the issue of prisoners who don't want to identify as Christians despite the pressure that they face in systems like that of the United States. Having actual physical monuments to alternative religious traditions gives them more basis for their alternative choices. 

This is not a trivial issue because in an era when we're seeing a re-thinking of drugs policies and the idea of taxing the legal sale of psychoactive drugs and using some of the funds to pay for "rehabilitation" we come to the key point. The mainstream drug "rehabilitation" system is the Twelve Step program which comes out of a Christian evangelical tradition. 

It's worth asking what a pagan drug rehab program would be. I think if we look at it in the context of other pagan religions like pre-agricultural Aryan Vedas we see that the consumption of drugs and the engagement in rites of ecstasy, dance and public eroticism was considered normal and desirable.   |-|

&gt;* As many as 31 pesticides with a value running into billions of pounds could have been banned because of potential health risks, if a blocked EU paper on hormone-mimicking chemicals had been acted upon, the Guardian has learned.

&gt;* The unpublished EU paper says that the risks associated with exposure to even low-potency EDCs is so great that potency alone should not serve as a basis for chemicals being approved for use.

&gt;* But commission officials say that under pressure from major chemical industry players, such as Bayer and BASF, the criteria were blocked.

|-| co8r3g0 || 34 || Here's the EU's road map on identifying Endocrine Disruptors (pdf below). It appears that they will be adopting the World Heath Organisation's criteria for identifying Endocrine Disruptors (ED) chemicals.

It is not easy to identify these chemical (despite the overly simplistic claims in the a Guardian article). Scientists have to isolate ED effects from other toxic effects, and there's the issue with incomplete data and science, that the Commission will have to assess the risk of each chemical based on probabilities rather than clear cut evidence of harm. They will have to ask... what level of risk is acceptable. 

They will be taking into account the socio-economic effects of a ban, this could become an issue when a chemical is identified that has a uncertain probability of adverse ED effect e.g. it might have a 5% chance of an ED effects but is highly beneficial.

The environmental parties and advocates, compared to industry, want to lower the bar for implementing a ban. This is where the argument is happening. Greens would like to ban a chemical even if there's a tiny negligible risk, they don't care about its use or benefit. While industry will emphasise the cost of a ban on a chemical who's ED effects are weak or not clearly proven by science. 

This is the age old argument between environmentalists and industry. Environmentalists accept little to no risk and don't care about the potential benefits of a chemical. 

It's a similar situation with nuclear power where environmental groups do not accept any risk, no level of radiation, no matter how small. They don't take into account the reduction in greenhouse gases nuclear affords. While industry will talk about nuclear power's benefits and the safety systems and practices that reduce risk.

tl;dr. If you encrypt a message of length n using a substitution/shift cipher with a unique key of length m, and m &gt; n,  then the message could decrypt into any other message of length n.

They're demanding that they be able to decrypt _everything_. That means files on your computer, and that means that, say, your information on a server can't be encrypted with your own password - There needs to be a "master" password so they can get the data.

(Probably something along the lines of a typical html page with instructions: first bit of encrypted data is in 2900nhnn.jpg beginning at offset 234, next bit of data is in jquery1.2.js, only look at the 4 least significant bits, ignore non-alphanumeric characters, decode from base64. next bit of data in main4.css at offset 0, css values and class names only, md5 sum is rot13 of ...)

The behavior of the client and server will mirror, as closely as possible, typical web traffic.

&gt;* DAKAR (Reuters) - French forces in northern Mali have killed around a dozen Islamist militants in the region of the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains, France's defense ministry said on Monday.

&gt;* The Islamist group was spotted by aerial surveillance, and engaged by French ground forces, one Malian source said.

&gt;* France has deployed some 3,000 troops in its Barkhane mission to combat Islamist groups operating in the Sahara desert and the arid Sahel region that runs to the south.

The source is the French army.  So you are basically believing what they say, without independent verification.  How certain are they when they claim to have killed "about a dozen"?  Is that 8?  10?  16?  I guess they don't really know.

We've seen time and time again how the US military has lied to make their prosecution of various wars appear more palpable to the US public.  For example, all military aged men, loosely defined, are considered "militants" in countries in which we are bombing.  Is France doing the same here?  We don't know.

We do know, and this article once again confirms, how easily global opinion is influenced by articles of this type.  Yay, we are killing the bad guys!

Police finally turn up with the only question of "how big was this meat clever" literally the only question they had. After persuading them to apprehend the guy they finally realised how insane he was and they expressed this alot and advised us (his neighbours) that they were taking him in for a mental examination.... Well the next night he was back home doing his usual routine so I inquired to the police what happened.... They played stupid.. The officers name I had didn't exist apparently. So I called the local hospital and I gave them the name and explained the situation... They immediately remembered and told me he had only been sent in for a physical and asked if I myself could bring him back.... I then rang the police back and got through to an actual officer who tried blaming things on their switchboard which made no sense sense... I then berated him till he hung up.....

&gt;Most complaints were about police failing in their duties or being rude and intolerant

Some more details:

* There were 34,863 cases involving complaints in 2013-14

* The figures show a 15% increase on the previous year- the highest since the IPCC was established in 2004.

* The largest percentage increase in complaint cases was recorded by Northumbria Police, which went from 401 complaints to 794, a rise of 98%.

* The next biggest rise was recorded by City of London Police, where complaints rose 90%

The story doesn't mention that body cameras on police are shown to drastically reduce police complaints, but they do. 

&gt;after cameras were introduced in February 2012, public complaints against officers plunged 88% compared with the previous 12 months. Officers' use of force fell by 60%

Then you ride along, of course it varies state to state here.

How much education and training do your police under go? It is my belief that further education allows a more tolerant mind that can critically think.

&gt;* The science is clear: Forest loss behind Brazil’s drought

The role of tropical deforestation in global climate change has been the subject of much international discussion and debate in the media and in policy forums like the UN Climate Change Convention.

&gt;* Their simulation showed that continued deforestation in the Amazon Basin would lead to decreased rainfall.

&gt;* Antonio Nobre, a scientist at the Brazilian National Space Research Institute, released a report, “The Future Climate of Amazonia,” that linked the current drought to deforestation in the Amazon Basin.

Also, [studies] (http://idbdocs.iadb.org/wsdocs/getdocument.aspx?docnum=1481581) pointed to the [rise in demand](http://www.portal2014.org.br/en/news/6567/HALF+OF+ALL+BRAZILIAN+CITIES+WILL+SUFFER+FROM+LACK+OF+WATER+IN+2015.html) and not enough supply more than a decade ago.

Deflorestation is an issue and we must fight it, but it is not, by far, the main cause of this current crysis. |-|

&gt;* This is in addition to the $100 million Congress added to NASA’s budget to begin design work for a Europa mission last year.

&gt;* Should the Europa Clipper spacecraft be ready for launch in the next decade, there could be a wonderful opportunity for a fast-track to Europa.

&gt;* The Europa Clipper will be focused on Europa in an effort to understand its habitable potential.

Example, We all lived on Mars billions of years ago and as the planet got closer to the Sun we needed to move. Found Earth that was starting to be susceptible so we sent a handful of people to try and colonize it.  
Upon arrival Mars heated up and lost its atmosphere killing everyone leaving the few on Earth to repopulate, rebuild etc... (Thus the Adam &amp; Eve idea)  
  
Now that we are on the brink of destruction again we need to find a new planet to "skip" to.  
  
This could happen since only say 20 people sent to a new planet would have to start from the stone age type of era to rebuild civilisation.  
  
I suggest that every system in space has life same/different but only a single planet in each system has life. We could be looking at the next system over for an "Earth" like planet but in reality the life living within the next system has evolved to live in harsh hot climates breathing nitrogen so as an example Venus equivalent in the next system holds life but as it looks like "Human" life cant live there we disregard it.

&gt;* North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in unusually frank remarks last week said North Koreans "never enjoyed an abundant life" and added he "cannot sleep" when he thinks about their suffering.

&gt;* The [North] Korean Central News Agency on Friday said Kim made the remarks as he revealed a paper he wrote on promoting North Korea's livestock industry.

&gt;* Kim said the "most important task is to boost the living standards of North Koreans quickly," and developing the livestock and fisheries industries could go a long way to solving the North's chronic food shortages.

|-| co9mx1f || 67 || Current The Interview based jokes aside, after the years of stagnation it would be amazing to see North Korea reach out to the world and ask for help kick-starting its economy and making an earnest attempt to join the international community. 

Say what you will, when was the last time suicide bombers from North Korea blew up a bus or beheaded someone? 

More than likely the effort would be met with a response in a 'Confessions of an Economic Hit Man' sense, but it would be intriguing to see a shift nonetheless. Reunification seems much more reasonable an outcome down this route.

Some sort of silver lining that does not end in war between North and South, or dirty bombs, would be ideal. The potential body count if that war reignited is unreal.

&gt;* SpaceX and Google form joint partnership to bring Internet access to the world

Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Google forge a partnership to bring Internet connectivity to the most remote places on Earth (and Mars) using satellites.

&gt;* The deal, which SpaceX confirmed on its website, will bolster SpaceX’s emerging satellite business and could help Google expand Internet access across the globe.

&gt;* Over the last few years, companies like Google and Facebook have turned their attention toward connecting the unconnected to the Internet.

There are some laws of physics that have to be observed. If you want satellites to be close to the ground, then there have to be lots of them. They also have a short lifetime, because low orbits decay quickly.

Large numbers of satellites get tricky to maneuver in synchronized orbits, and managing the data flow becomes challenging.

Even at the lowest orbit, satellites will be hundreds of miles from people on the ground, compared to a mile away to a cell phone tower. This will define what sort of radio equipment will work. Iridium phones don't work indoors or under tree cover.

Can someone list for me, I'm on my phone, and the site is blocked in China...and I can't see my phone for all the smog. |-| 
|-| co9fg3x || 84 || I posted this in another copy of this thread but:

If he was serious about that, he wouldn't have taken the commission, or resigned immediately. Instead he sat as chair to the commission for the bulk of its lifespan and will resign now that there are 2 months left before publishing of findings.

If he was serious about not "overshadowing" he wouldn't have waited this long. He's poisoned the well and now he's going to "step back" to pretend he didn't.

This is all just political maneuvering and nothing to do with honesty.

The whole thing was a travesty from the start.   |-| 
|-| co9b7pp || 62 || To be clear, the charge of bias arises from the fact that Schabas worked for the PLO. This would be akin to having a lawyer who did advisory work for the Likud party head the commission.  |-| 
|-| co99s0u || 30 || Schabas refused to give any [legal response](http://blog.unwatch.org/index.php/2014/09/12/when-william-schabas-was-convicted-in-1974-he-tried-to-disqualify-the-judges-for-bias/) throughout the entire ordeal.

Great that it's finally over and that he's stepping down. |-| 
|-| co9ke1l || 19 || Why is someone who consulted a terrorist organization allowed in the position, ot even un in the first place. |-| 
|-| co9jyhs || 3 || **Article summary:**

&gt;* Israel had long criticized Schabas' appointment, citing his record as a strong critic of the Jewish state and its current political leadership.

&gt;* "This work in defence of human rights appears to have made me a huge target for malicious attacks (...)."

&gt;* Canadian academic William Schabas was appointed last August by the head of the United Nations Human Rights Council to lead a three-member group looking into alleged war crimes during Israel's military offensive in Gaza.

|-| co9hoqb || 8 || Thank goodness. Hopefully there will be an unbiased inquiry soon. |-| 
|-| co9eawt || 4 || Schabanana hey hey hey, good bye. |-| 
|-| co9kp5h || -6 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| co9onjc || -6 || Well, Israel said the exact same thing about Richard Goldstone, the head of the previous Gaza inquiry.

This was despite the fact that Richard Goldstone was a renowned judge during the South African apartheid and was himself Jewish. |-| 
|-| co9agz4 || -38 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| co9a84p || -47 || Israel will do anything to pervert any attempt at justice.

Though the report is already done. |-| 
|-| co9hla9 || -6 || /r/nottheonion! |-| 
|-| co9bjzr || 13 || &gt;By leaking internal discussions about supplying lethal weapons to Kiev, the Obama administration may be warning Putin to back off.

On the contrary, it would probably encourage him more.  |-| 
|-| co93crf || 40 || Russia has a serious history of partitioning its neighbours. If you're neighbouring Russia it would be hella hard to get partitioning insurance. |-| 
|-| co945zu || 13 || Russia wants a buffer zone. All of Ukraine used to be a buffer zone. But Putin will turn eastern Ukraine into a buffer zone if he can. |-| 
|-| co99xhr || -3 || Frankly partitioning the Ukraine is the only thing that's going to end the conflict.  Let the mostly Russian areas join Nova-Russia or whatever the puppet state's name is an expel the Russians from the largely Ukrainian areas.  Build defensible borders for the Ukrainian state and then let them join NATO.  

When ethnic groups no longer want to live together partition is always best. |-| 
|-| co97cu7 || -10 || NATO partitioned Kosovo from Serbia, sounds like a good idea to do the same sort of thing. |-| 
|-| co91nzj || -6 || i could of told you that. Russia want half of Ukraine.  |-| 
|-| co97z0d || -4 || The rebels are winning and the only way to stop them is to get the us military directly involved with the conflict.

He is just ramping up the rhetoric to get the people hyped up for another war. |-| 
|-| co97ilo || -12 || The US has no legitimate reason to care other than their tensions with Russia over natural resources. I hate how the media frames this as some noble concern for the Ukrainians. They could give a fuck less, it's all an indirect dick waving contest.  |-| 
|-| co91l45 || -15 || Pro-war propaganda.  |-| 
|-| co9fubt || -7 || Let's put it out clearly. The US wants a war with Russia. They only want to make sure their redditors are on board, it's only a matter of time before we start reading comments calling for the involvement of US military personnel to stop the new Hitler. My guess is that this conflict is over the European gas market. Putin is getting ahead by building a new line through Turkey (NATO member) as this conflict could interrupt the gas flowing into Europe from Russia.
 |-| 
|-| co9er1a || -3 || You say that like it would be a bad thing. |-| 
|-| co9ptoa || -3 || Jesus. Who cares what the US thinks? The US has invaded one country after another over the last few decades without even the slightest legitimate pretext. 

Only complete idiots take anything the US has to say with any seriousness. We have zero credibility. |-| 
|-| co9ix38 || -4 || It's only right that the U.S. should be increasingly concerned when you consider it's Commander in Chief is non other than B/Obama. |-| 
|-| co9ec0r || -5 || Newsflash, mongoloids, it has already happened, 

Ewe should worry about them taking the whole thing, then rolling take westward. |-| 
|-| co8x7nc || 63 || ....aaaand the pro-Palestinian internet mob is nowhere to be found.  No Jews, no news.  |-| 
|-| co8v1n8 || 23 || It just goes to show you that Israel isn't the only country who has serious problems with the *"neighbors."* Buffer zones and even fucking walls have to be built at great cost just to keep innocent people alive and the threat of Palestinian terrorism at bay.  |-| 
|-| co951pp || 5 || If the weapons are coming from Gaza, how are they getting to Gaza? I thought all weapons that Hamas used came through the tunnels from Egypt  |-| 
|-| co9c6q0 || 4 || The underreaction to this is telling. |-| 
|-| co93l2f || 13 || &gt;With civilians shot at checkpoints, frequent raids on homes and a punishing curfew in some areas, the state soon lost the support of the locals and the buffer zone has the potential to alienate them still further.

&gt;Rafah’s population already lives under martial law and contend on a daily basis with a 4 p.m. curfew in some places, checkpoints, raids on homes and random arrests.

Fucking Israelis. Oh wait, never mind. |-| 
|-| co95ytb || 3 || Pay for tunnelers just increased by 27%, spurring on more creative ways to become molemen, modified shoulder mounted drill rigs, men armoured up like armadillos in case of cave in, reality show anybody. |-| 
|-| co99qmj || 3 || Well this is going to suck for a lot of people. |-| 
|-| co9a7g8 || 3 || Canada and Mexico wish that they could do the same to parts of the US to crack down on the guns. |-| 
|-| co9bgkt || 9 || I wonder how long it's going to be before people are yelling "Apartheid!" at Egypt like they do at Israel. |-| 
|-| co95rmo || 4 || Buffer zones are good weather Egyptian or Israeli.   But they should
be cutting the zones out of Gaza not their own lands.  Oh well, currently Gaza run by Hamas is the worlds most popular "underdog"
being oppressed by it's neighbors.  Maybe better to destroy your own
real estate than theirs. |-| 
|-| co97nj4 || 4 || If they could only do the same on the other side of the border... Rafah is true shit hole on earth.  |-| 
|-| co8uvxg || 5 || Good to see the Egyptians are having none of this religious nonsense.  |-| 
|-| co9mbc5 || 24 || Report says: One person died. Nine injured. Transformer blew up. |-| 
|-| co9mjx5 || 19 || Why are most of the comments on news articles nowadays bad jokes? |-| 
|-| co9p41c || 3 || Right round the corner from my house. Tragedy. According to the news another guy has died bringing the total to two. |-| 
|-| co9ifol || -21 || They still have Woolworths ???? |-| 
|-| co9fxdb || -48 || Let me guess, a muslim? |-|

|-| co9oi8h || 4 || Does China even have military drills with NK? (Serious question) |-| 
|-| co9p6o1 || 5 || Cmon, even Russians must know they've done something wrong if they're allying themselves with the freakin North Koreans. |-| 
|-| co9jenp || 59 || Russia must look itself in the mirror and realize they went from being Europe's darling a few years ago, to having to hang out with North Korea and Cuba at the fat kids table.  |-| 
|-| co9kggs || 5 || Joining drills with NK &amp; Cuba? LOL... russia future is so dark. |-| 
|-| co9j2rw || 6 || Lol so much for Cuba getting friendly with the US. |-| 
|-| co9l9i5 || 4 || I am sorry, but if you want to relieve your sanctions and the stigma on your name, why the heck would they do this? |-|
