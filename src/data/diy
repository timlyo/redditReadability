|-| cntt2s0 || 6 || My house is very cold and expensive to heat. This is the first step towards a warm home and lower energy bills. Sealing leaks and blowing insulation into the attic is next.  Then I will insulate the floors.  |-| 
|-| cnttqj9 || 14 || First thing I recommend to my friends when they buy a place. Insulate everything. For $650 (I paid cash making it cheaper) I got blown in insulation 16 inches deep in my attic on top of the existing 2 inch insulation. 

It has saved me a tank of oil a year meaning it paid for itself in a year and a half.

|-| cntyksi || 10 || The 6V battery provides power for the circuit. The symbol is oriented so that the negative terminal (down) goes to "ground" and the positive (up) goes through a photoresistor, which is the part labeled "LDR" (light-dependent resistor).

The photoresistor allows a variable current to pass based on the light exposure it gets.

The round thing in the middle with "B", "C" and "E" labels is an NPN bipolar junction transistor, or just "transistor" or "BJT." In this circuit, it amplifies the current from the photoresistor it gets on "B" (base), which you can think of as the transistor's "control input", and allows more or less current to pass through between "C" (collector) and "E" (emitter). When the photoresistor (LDR) puts enough current through B, the transistor will allow enough current between C and E for the motor to begin spinning. Basically, you are using a small current, produced by the photoresistor, to control a relatively large current required by the motor to operate. It's an electronic switch, or really, an electronic speed control.

The diode protects the transistor from back EMF when the motor slows down. The motor spinning has some inertia, and when you take the voltage away from the motor or reduce its available current, it continues to spin a bit before it slows to the right speed or stops. This actually turns the motor into a generator, making an excess voltage that actually flows in reverse in the circuit, and that could potentially damage the transistor. The diode selectively (by its orientation) shorts this reverse voltage, so it just passes into oblivion (not really, it becomes a small amount of heat, but practically speaking, it's gone).

The diagram is a little incomplete. The 6V terminal over the top of the motor symbol should just be a wire connection to the positive terminal of the 6V battery, where LDR and the battery are connected. That may not necessarily be true if, for example, you were trying to control a 24V motor from this circuit, which you could do.

The ground symbols mean implicitly that the negative terminal of the battery is connected to E on the transistor. For this circuit as drawn, with everything powered from the same 6V battery, you could just consider this a wire from the negative terminal of the battery to E on the transistor.

The black screw you have should screw into the brass insert, which is normally stuck in the chairback, but it is currently on the screw.  The insert is the part that creates the tension and allows the back to stay upright.

If that is the real problem, then you can just glue the inserts back into the back and then screw everything back together. I would recommend something like gorilla glue and be sure not to get it in the threaded portion, as that will make it hard to get the crews back in.  |-|

|-| cnu8prc || 3 || Looks great. I had never thought about adding the tap insert between the lid and freezer base - very clever and eliminates unnecessary holes.  |-| 
|-| cnu8t8t || 7 || I like this question - ignore those who keep saying wireless is just as good - it isn't.  
I wired my last home for Gigabit when I moved into it in 2003, and it was awesome the entire time I lived there.  I went all out when I did it, had a punchdown block in the basement and 24 drops in the house (half of which were in the basement for LAN parties - I did say it was 2003!).  
If you pick up a box of Cat 5E cable, you would surely be able to do your entire trailer - I was fortunate enough to have multiple leftover boxes from a job site that were too short for commercial wiring, but plenty long enough for a house (where the max run is typically well under 100') which allowed my to run multiple cables at the same time.  
I do recommend modular wall plates - you can get them from graybar - that will let you put up to 4-6 of varies types of cables coming out of any location.  I had one I terminated at my desk are that had 3 RJ-45 for network, 2 coax for cable, and 1 for telephone (that remained unused for 10 years).  It gives a much cleaner look and is only a little bit more money and effort.  

You shouldn't have to worry about cable length in a residential trailer - no worry about speed drop.  

Then at the head end (where everything comes together), tie it all into a small gigabit switch - obviously you need one port for each jack in the house, so plan accordingly. |-|

|-| cnuck6r || 4 || Looks really good. 

With that being said, I would go the extra mile and enclose the LEDs so that the only light coming through would be through the holes. Doesn't seem like much more work at this point.

|-| cnuucu5 || 3 || The paint job turned out great! What type of paint did you use? |-| 
|-| cnuuwo2 || 33 || So, not to question you op, but were I you I would have simply sanded a bit better, put a few coats of poly on it to make it shine and left it. That's some NICE mid-century wood. 

Also, it's a changing table. Sadly, good poly is more resistant and easier to clean than paint.  |-| 
|-| cnuv0uw || 11 || Looks great. It really wasn't necessary to sand down to bare wood if you were painting, though. A proper water based primer (hint: not sold at home depot) would stick to the cabinet with a light sanding, or not sanding at all.

Edit: proper cleaning is still necessary though. I usually wipe with varsol, light sand, and vacuum or wipe with a tack cloth.  |-| 
|-| cnuv4yg || 47 || It looks nice, good color. I'm always bummed to see beautiful grain covered in paint, though. Also, what did you do with the "gross" brass handles? They're much like the ones that were on my childhood dresser that I no longer have, and I like them a lot. |-| 
|-| cnuv87c || 16 || Sad to see that beautiful wood painted.  |-| 
|-| cnuvcbx || 16 || Noooo why'd you do all that sanding if you were just gonna paint it. Should have just poly'd it |-| 
|-| cnuve7e || 3 || I'm worried about it being a changing table. Although babies should never be left unattended, the lip on changing tables, still really helps when you have an active baby.  FYI my autocorrect kept putting "hanging table." Oh, autocorrect! |-| 
|-| cnuvmc4 || 7 || Well...good job, good effort, it was brown now it's blue.  It's not better looking it's just different than before. If the old handles were brass, consider putting them back on craigslist, you may get the price of the dresser and then all you spent was the time and materials. Also it seems like it would be uncomfortable for the baby as a changing table and unsafe as it is.  If the top drawer was taken out and set on the top there would be a lip to hold the baby from rolling off. You could paint the inside of the carcass where the drawer was to match the rest of the dresser or a contrasting color and use that space to hold diapers and wipes. Then when you don't need a changing table any longer put the drawer back in. Just a suggestion.   |-| 
|-| cnuvp5a || 8 || Nice work, though a shame you covered up that beautiful wood after taking the effort to do such a thorough job sanding it. Though as someone else said, you want to put a lip on the top of that to ensure your baby doesn't roll off. Once they become active, you literally cannot let your eyes off them for a split second. That's all it takes for them to decide the first time to roll over is on that changing table while you turn around to grab something. I have a 9 month old and yesterday she was sitting in a bumbo chair on the floor, reached just a little too far for a toy while I was paying more attention to making dinner, and she fell face first onto the floor. Thankfully she didn't hurt herself, just the shock of falling out of her seat, but that would have been a nasty fall from a changing table height. |-|

|-| cnv2yue || 5 || I'm sure people more knowledgeable than I am will chip in. My experience is that the lacquer will seal the wood and create a film on top. Oil needs to soak into the wood fibers.

|-| cnvdr09 || 10 || I've been going through a moon phase recently (pun absolutely intended), and thought it would be fun to make a wearable or totable that displayed the current state of the moon. There would be a bit of hardware involved, so a purse seemed like the perfect vehicle—you're already carrying a load of other things, so there's no harm in the addition of a small battery pack or a pile of LEDs. Not that I carry a purse myself, but it's more about the making than it is the having.

I experimented with matrices of LEDs turning off and on in the right places to show the current phase, but it didn't have the precision I wanted—you could still see the individual pixels. What I realized would work, though, was a white EL panel and interchangeable masks for each phase.

The purse is made from heavy-duty black marine vinyl. The fabric print of the moon was uploaded to and custom ordered from [Spoonflower](http://spoonflower.com). The masks were laser cut out of Delrin by [Ponoko](http://ponoko.com). The electronics came from [Adafruit](http://adafruit.com) and [SparkFun](http://sparkfun.com).

The inverter that converts the two AA batteries into the high voltage the EL panel requires makes a high-pitched whine, but when it's closed into the purse you can't hear it unless you're listening, and even then you can't unless you're in a quiet room.

You can use a zip tool, link below, to pop siding on and off. You can pick up a replacement piece of siding at a big box store. I'd recommend Menards. They have some in stock and lots of samples you can take home to color match. I found the best match for my color there. You can also swap the spray painted piece with a piece from a less noticeable area.

I had my workshop in there and did the exact same thing to try to make it more comfortable in the winter.  First I secured the door in place to make it as air tight as possible.  Then I wrapped the garage door opening with a vapor barrier (house wrap) and hung batt insulation.  

While it did reduce the drafts, without a constant source of heat the cement floor and cast iron of all of my tools constituted too much thermal mass to be able to warm up the space easily when I went out to use it each day.  I even tried maintaining a higher than normal temperature using a space heater but that was just an expensive struggle.  

**TL;DR** Without a constant and properly sized heat source (read: expensive), the effect of insulated around the door won't be worth the time. |-|

|-| cnx7d6h || 4 || I am in the construction business and also had a glass block window over my tub in my condo.  First thing you need to accept is that the glass block is going to leak no matter what you do.  Glass block walls are a nightmare.  You need to manage the water that does infiltrate.  If possible, I would recommend trying to put metal or rubber flashing around the bottom stud and folded up around the jambs, pitch it outside.  The jambs and header should be wrapped also.  Be sure to overlap the flashing.  Another option is to remove some of the interior grout and use an epoxy grout.  As far as for your tile, put a crack membrane under the tile.  

Even if you can only get the flashing to clear your studs, it can drain behind your siding.

The amount of time and effort you are going to spend trying to get it water tight and repairing it in the future is going to approach the costs of a new window. |-| 
|-| cnx8i9i || 5 || I favor covered storage to pegboards and french cleats.  Sawdust gets everywhere in a wood shop.  ikea cabinets are ridiculously cheap if the environment (humidity) permits. |-|

Consider rugs. |-| 
|-| cnxa9rv || 7 || If they are a solid hardwood floor then you could restore them. I must warn you that it is alot of work to sand, stain, and restore a hardwood floor that has been painted over. 

If you want the driftwood look and the option to return to the original floor than consider installing a driftwood snap and lock DIY laminate wood flooring on top of your current floor. If you can put legos together than you can install snap and lock wood laminate flooring. 

If you ever change your mind just remove the snap and lock floor and presto your other untouched floor is right below it. Use an underlament between the floors so your snap and lock does not scratch your real wood.

This gives you the option of changing your mind without all the sanding, dust, and hard work. I have used the cheaper $1 a square foot wood laminate flooring throughout my house and I love it. When looking at laminate flooring use the AC rating vice the price or thickness to determiner quality. You will notice that most of the cheap stuff has the same AC rating (AC 3.0) as the expensive stuff.

|-| cnxaupa || 4 || Have you though of Hilti. They make great products. |-| 
|-| cnxayux || 3 || I agree with you the corner of room one is your best option. It would give the best flow through, and from my perspective the cuts would be much easier. Going this route makes your bedroom door cuts easier and better looking. 

Don't forget when you come through the door of bedroom one you must work from that point across the room. Minimize waste by using every scrap from a cut for starter pieces. 

I find installing flooring fun and rewarding. Go for it and post pictures!

|-| cnxbg6s || 3 || Cabinets mounted on a french cleat system so they can be trivially re-arranged as necessary.  Pegboard in the cabinets, if you really want pegboard, but anything exposed will gather sawdust, and in a barn, that likely means it will also gather moisture as the humidity and temperature changes, and that means rusty tools. |-| 
|-| cnxct6s || 3 || It would be far, far cheaper and easier to buy new flooring and install it yourself.

The majority of the flooring's cost comes from the finish they put on it. They do it in a factory, with bulk purchases and professionals/robots.

Unless you are very experienced with wood finishes, I suggest you reconsider. You are looking a 1 hour per square foot minimum of manual labor, mostly sanding. You won't be able to refinish a 10x10 room with less than 120 hours of work, and it will take about a month worth of cure times.

(to finish wood floors correctly, you are going to do many coats and sand after each one).

Even after all that work, you are unlikely to match the original quality and look.

|-| cnxelxy || 7 || In addition to the other good advice you've gotten so far, I'll add that you should spend some time air sealing between the attic and the second floor. More energy is transferred by drafts than by radiation through the drywall, thus greater heat loss. Use a can of spray foam to seal up gaps around the tops of walls, plumbing vents, electrical and so on to keep air from moving from the second floor's condition space into the attic. Adding batts of insulation, even with facing, is not going to create an air-tight gap, which is what you want. It's obviously easier to air seal it before you blow in another 2 feet of fiberglass on top of what you have. |-| 
|-| cnxgl14 || 6 || Start in the big main room, along the wall with the tile....this will minimize the amount of laminate you have to lay backwards as you enter your other rooms. 

When I lay laminate below grade, I use 6mm poly as a vapour barrier and tape it up the walls just a bit so the baseboards will cover it. I use 3m Sheathing tape for this. 
Concrete holds moisture, and that moisture can "wick" up through your laminate. This would be bad. Very bad.

Quick tips:  1. Always start your rows in The shit. The shit refers to the toughest part for that particular row. Have a doorway you'll have to get through? Start your row there. Meet up with tile? Start your row there. Starting in the shit means you wont have to fight the tough parts as much. 
 
2. Have a piece that you cannot get to lock in? Cut the locking mechanism off (not the whole thing, just shave it a little) with a sharp knife or chisel, and then use glue to hold it together. Tape that shit up (With painters tape!!) until the glue dries. Bam.

|-| cnxhc72 || 5 || So working current is 1.5A per meter, working voltage is 12 volts... 

Power (Watts) = Current (amps) x voltage

Watts = 1.5A x 12VDC = 18watts per meter of strip...

Any transformer/inverter over 90 watts (18 watts/meter x 5 meters) will work. It has to have an output of 12VDC though.


Edit: I can't state for certain, but it [LOOKS](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61o2ZVNWwxL._SL1200_.jpg) like if you cut the strip you'll have to solder wires between the R-G-B-12VDC points (labeled as such on above each orange dot).

|-| cnxiavw || 3 || Do those 4 small rectangles represent windows? If so how big are they and how much light do they let in? You usually want natural light to go parallel with your flooring. Depending on the light it can make a big difference on how the seams in your floor look. Also you preferably want to go lengthwise in the biggest room. So my first suggestion would be to change the orientation of the way you're laying the flooring down.

You apply light to edges of the glass and use luminescent dry-erase markers on. The light refracts off the marker giving a cool effect. 

It's hard to distinguish with the link you provided but that one will have a black backing behind the screen to provide contrast so that the light can be seen. If you were to take the same concept without the backing, it would work pretty well but only in a dark room. Glass, LEDs and luminescent markers is all you need. |-|

|-| cnxqcyb || 4 || Escaped former insulator here.  

A]  ~~You in the US?  See if your state has one of these programs where they, or the electric company will send out an energy auditor~~.. I see you're from Maryland.. you have some kind of  home energy audit / conservation thing but I think you need to 'income qualify, [check it out.](http://www.mdhousing.org/website/Programs/lieep/Default.aspx) sometimes you can get a free energy audit, insulation advice, and even free or discounted insulation, air sealing, weatherization, and even some goodies like getting all your lightbulbs changed.  

We have [this thing in MA,](http://www.masssave.com/) but I'm not sure if every state mandates this.  It's pretty good and they can give you the best advice.


  Failing that, and depending on how much work you want to put into the whole thing...

1]  **Leave the existing insulation**, unless it's something potentially problematic like vermiculite.  Bagging it up will take forever and is probably counterproductive.  

1a] Extra time on your hands?  Move the old stuff out of the way so you can see the top of the ceiling drywall and **seal all penetrations** [like HVAC ducts, electrical wires coming up, or the joints created by the top-plates of interior walls etc..] with **expanding foam.**  This is a pain in the ass but it turns out that a huge part of keeping heat in is 'air sealing,' and it's the first thing the energy conservation programs do.  It's the low-hanging fruit.  Maybe you can find a spunky young person to do it, although they have to *not fall through the ceiling.*   

2]  VENTILATION 

figure out if you have adequate ventilation in your attic.  This means vents down near your soffits as well as vents higher up, either in the gable walls or as a long ridge vent.  Here's [a calculator for it](http://www.askthebuilder.com/calculating-ventilation-area-of-attic/), it's a ratio of attic floor space to ridge / soffit vents, and it's less compllicated than it sounds.   For ever thousand square feet of attic floor, you need X s.f. of soffit vent and x/y s.f. of ridge vent.   

This should help with your mold problem and having the 'balanced' ventilation reduces the tendency of the attic to suck  air out of the house while retaining the ability of the attic to have an appropriate air flow.

Protect your soffit vents from getting clogged in the next step by stapling in these [stupid little styrofoam things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1EtB8SrRQY) at the bottom of each rafter bay or make something more substantial to keep the air flowing up through the soffit vents.

3]  INSULATE WITH CELLULOSE

For fucks sake, don't even bother with fiberglass batts.  They're more just to get pass building inspections than to keep heat in, for two basic reasons:  

a]  the open nature of fiberglass allows for air convection through the insulation, which increases as the temperature difference between inside and outside increases, i.e. when it's actually cold outside.  So when you need it to work, it's effective R value has dropped way off.

b] Batts are useless in an attic... unless you're blowing cellulose over the top of the whole mess.  The spaces between the insulation and the joists are not good and will not magically improve over time. 

Cellulose is the shit for so many reasons I can't even start to list them.   Most places will let you use their cellulose blowing machine and hoses if you buy the bales of cellulose from them.

Get that ply out and just blow cellulose over the top of the old stuff.  You might put down a single strip of 2 x 10 on top of the joists, right down the middle of the attic so you have something to walk on, even though it will be under a foot of fluff.  That will be better than trying to find each joist to stand on when you have to get up there to replace a bathroom fan or run a wire.  

You've got an R Value target, so you can just figure out what depth you will need based on a chart on the bag.  What you blow will settle a little, and they have figured out what it 'settles down to' and that's what's on the chart.  

I would give up on storing shit up there.  You would need to basically frame out a platform above the insulation, and it's going to be dusty, so fuck it.  

Wow, why did I write this long thing?  Anyway, good luck bro and fucking wear dust protection.  I think I fucked my lungs up by working for ten years only wearing a mask half the time.  oh well.

|-| cnxrmde || 4 || One thing to consider instead of classic pull-drawers for your inevitable collections of hardware  and oddments is a series of [bus tubs](http://www.shopbuy.org/image/a6008456774dc45497e9fb1b0de21906.html)  arranged on slide-in racks, with flanges supporting the tub lip. Bus tubs are available for about $3 each from any restaurant/hotel/bar supplier; they are a convenient size, and astonishingly robust and versatile. They're a standardized length and width so getting the right size from a different supplier is never a prob, and you can get them in two or three different depths. You can, of course [buy racks](http://www.americanacompanies.com/rack-carts.html), but it's far cheaper to build your own, rolling or fixed, out of 3/4 ply and square 1-by stock. And unlike milk crates, bus tubs are leakproof, and have no holes for small stuff to fall through and become lost forever. 

Standard wooden drawers are time-consuming to build, and decent hardware is expensive. Plus they get dirty, bind, wear and break down, especially when overloaded with too much weight; once broken, they are fussy and expensive to fix. In contrast, a busted or spilled-in bus tray costs you just the price of a coffee to replace. And reorganizing your storage is a snap - just pull 'em out, and switch 'em around. No unloading contents, or mucking about with off-register hardware, as with drawers. Plus, in a pinch, bus trays are built to lock into each other securely, if you stack them crosswise. Covers are available for delicate stuff you don't want to get dusty.

Been a Motion Picture Property Master for 30 years. My 5-ton prop truck is a rolling general/hardware store full of everything from hand tools to watch pins to dolls to playing cards to hydraulic jacks. Virtually the only small items I store in drawers any more is stuff that needs to be kept secure: my inventory of watches and rings, blanks for firearms, and the like. Same thing goes in my two storage lockers - just a 20 foot long rack of bus trays on one side, and some simple plywood shelves for bulky items like luggage and coolers on the other. Very efficient, and a breeze to keep organized, using nothing more than a roll of masking tape and a Magic Marker. |-|

|-| cob73cy || 4 || Although burning a shamrock onto the wood would be cool, for simplicity and cost effectiveness I'd suggest going the stencil and stain (instead of paint) route. You can find an assortment of wood stain colors at any home improvement store.

As for materials, at any home improvement store you can find premium quality 2"x4" wood boards. They're very common. If you're outside of the U.S. of course the boards may not be in inches, but there will be an equivalent size. Find the straightest, most blemish-free boards you can.

To approximate the height:width:length ratio (3:5:15)of a Jenga block, you'll want to cut your 2x4 boards into lengths somewhere around 8-10". If you want to get really precise about it, a 2"x4" board is actually 1.5"x3.5", so to be exact you'd need to cut the width down to 2.5" and the length to 7.5", but I'd personally just stick to the original size for the height and width.

To inexpensively cut the boards, you can buy what's called a [miter box](http://www.harborfreight.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/i/m/image_16352.jpg) and handsaw, which allows you to follow pre-cut guides to make clean cuts by hand. If you have access to a powered miter saw, that will be much faster.

That will give you your blocks. At this point it would be a good idea to sand all the boards down so they're as smooth as you can get them, if they're not already, and to round all the edges a bit to help the pieces slide out. You can do this by hand but it will take a while. If you have access to a power sander, use that, or you can buy an inexpensive one. I once found a cheap power sander at Target for only $6. It wasn't that great, but I used it for years.

That should be about it. |-|

Just to let you know, although Dewalt is a great brand, for the price you are paying for the 20v, you can get an 18v Milwaukee (better quality in my opinion) and still have money to spend on accessories such as drill bit mediums and driver kits.  

[Just so you know, the whole 20v thing is a semantic gimmick.  they are really 18v, you just spend more money for a lie.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBehZbptnCw) |-| 
|-| cobi7er || 5 || What you need is good old fashioned Palmolive dish soap.

mix 1 part soap and 2 parts water in a spray bottle and spray em in flight and watch em go down immediately.  You can completely (and safely) clear a room of flies in about 5 minutes with a bottle of palmolive-water-spray.

Palmolive contains a slippery surfactant that basically makes them suffocate and drown.  Watch em twitch while they die.  Good times!


If you spray it...they will die.  Ant, roaches, basically anything creepy and crawly that crunches when you step on it is fair game and will diee if you spray it with Palmolive.

Not Dawn, not Joy, PALMOLIVE.  (or Fairy, if youre a Brit).

Good luck, soldier. |-| 
|-| cobgtgr || 3 || Keep all your doors close to see where they come from. They're not likely to be coming from all rooms at the same time. If you keep your doors close you should be able to pinpoint one room in particular with more flies than the others. Then inspect that room thoroughly. It's easier than trying to inspect the entire house. |-|

|-| cog3enh || 58 || My friend Garry and I built this over the span of 4 months. A weekend here and there in his garage and neither of us had any real wood working experience but I think it came out great.

She was completely blown away as it has 2 of her favorite things, Doctor Who and Galaga. It was the center piece of the party.

The arcade is powered using a Raspberry Pi B+ running the latest RetroPie image with a special build of Mame4All (the original didn't support all the buttons). It has 170+ games loaded onto it and each day I've been adding more.

Using an IR module for the pi the Tardis-Cade it can be controlled using the Sonic Screwdriver. It can power it up, navigate the menu, and add quarters to the mame emulators.

Here's a video of it booting:

|-| cog6web || 16 || I´m not into Dr. Who but that´s simply awesome!  |-| 
|-| cog978d || 8 || Looks very cool, the folks at /r/cade would probably love to see the build. |-| 
|-| cogc684 || 6 || I was hoping the tardis would be a doorway into an arcade room... so it'd be bigger on the inside. Looks awesome, good work! |-| 
|-| cogd9ap || 5 || Nice work, well done.

The DIY table saw had me cringing.  Don't mess with power tools, particularly when you can get a real table saw for far less than a trip to the emergency room to re-attach fingers. |-|

|-| cogcrd2 || 3 || Very cool. Maybe I'm missing something, but there must've been a better way to paint this than using $90 of spray cans. Can't you get paint tinted at any hardware store to essentially any shade you'd like? And it would be made for wood instead of sheet metal.  |-|

I'd like to make my own fighting sticks and was curious about the difficulty of it all.

|-| cogvh9n || 28 || so, wtf is with all these pallets? they used to repair them and put them back into circulation, and then eventually they were so crapped out they were unusable. I know a guy who's first job was to repair pallets. what has changed? 

I know I once in a blue blue moon get a pallet when I order something really fucking big, like furniture, is that where everyone is getting these from? |-|

Seriously though, that looks GREAT! I've been wanting to build myself a new desk, and was planning on using a solid core door for the surface, but this has so much character I'm starting to change my mind.  I guess I better start collecting pallets...

BTW, from what I've learned here, and in /r/woodworking, you can clamp some straight, flat stock crossways above and below surface during the glue up (they're called cauls) to keep everything flat. |-| 
|-| cogzjvz || 10 || Looks awesome, though I am surprised you haven't caught any flack for taking a blue pallet yet. |-|

A job well done mate |-| 
|-| cogvcx7 || 5 || Ha, this is great.  I have a similar small top glued together made from ply which i haven't sanded yet.  It's a bit uneven and I decided (2 minutes ago) that it wasn't possible to make it look good but then I come on Reddit and yours is so ace I need to stop whining and just sand it!  Good work. |-| 
|-| cogxt16 || 4 || Looks awesome!  For future reference, you only need to use prestain on certain softer wood species, like pine, and only if you are actually going to apply stain.  Since you just clear coated it with poly, it wasn't needed, but it didnt hurt anythjng either.  Keep up the good work! |-|

|-| coh0rgp || 3 || For some odd reason I was expecting to see a stack of pallets nailed together with knee holes cut out. |-|

|-| coh1lle || 3 || I don't think it counts if you cannot tell that the item was made out pallets.  I was expecting to see a couple horizontal pallets on top of a couple vertical pallets. |-| 
|-| cogzlr0 || 11 || You destroyed a blue CHEP pallet? Nice. You just cost somebody some cash. CHEP rents their pallets to distributors for a monthly fee. I've heard stories of people from CHEP showing up demanding their pallets back. (Edit: I see __dilligaf__ posted a link a similar story)


Now they are going to come and repo your desk! Lol. It is a sharp desk though. Nice job!

 |-| 
|-| coh27nn || 3 || From a guy who does this for a living to you, please for the love of god tell me you sealed this with a waterproof wax or seal, there is a reason people use these kind of soft pines for pallets, you also might have a problem with warping due to not actually flattening this stuff somewhere along the line if you let moisture get into it (pine eats water like nobody's business).

Not trying to be a know it all, I would just hate for your hard work to come apart months or years down the line. Other than that it looks really good |-| 
|-| cog5f36 || 4 || Two kitchen knives and a display box made for a dear friend's birthday.  I started with knife blanks from [Texas Knifemaker's Supply](http://www.texasknife.com/vcom/product_info.php?cPath=119_299_315&amp;products_id=6605) and made a set of handle scales for each knife out of Purpleheart, Wenge, Maple, and Aluminum.  

The display box is a simple sliding lid box with splined miters.  I based it off of [Jay Bates' Two Player Chinese Checkers Game Box](http://jayscustomcreations.com/2014/06/how-to-make-a-2-player-chinese-checkers-game-box/), but modified it a bit. 

The box is made out of Poplar, including a highly figured piece for the lid.  The lid has a Bloodwood inlay border, and the box features Purpleheart splines.   |-|

|-| cogbeou || 3 || That's pretty genius!  I could see something like this being a commercial product.  Everything seems to have a wall power supply, but it's almost always 5, 9, or 12 volts.   |-| 
|-| cogp8kq || 3 || Me no electricity smart, what this be for? |-| 
|-| cogedvj || 3 || Be sure you provide fuse protection for each outlet.
Note that Apple devices may say they aren't charging, but will charge slowly anyway -- like overnight instead of in two hours.

Be sure the voltages are actually 12 and 5. Nonregulated power supplies, paired with products, output the correct voltage when loaded down by the product, but a 12V supply with hardly any load on it outputs almost 17V. I've never seen an unregulated 5V, however.

Check that 14V device -- though it says 14 volts, does it really run on 12V? It may be one that charges through an unregulated supply, but that can charge fully and operate when given a regulated 12 volts. |-|

|-| cogc0qx || 6 || From your description it sounds like you double phased your fridge (Sent line current into the neutral and line side.) It should definitely have blown the run capacitor or start relay before the compressor. Another thing to check is the defrost timer, these are VERY sensitive to voltage and can cause the unit not to cool when they fail. I find about 1/3 of non cooling refrigerators have a bad defrost timer. |-| 
|-| cog1z28 || 11 || Fun fact ; Fridges are sorta' simple in electrical terms. 

Got a compressor, fuse, bit of wiring and that's about it. 

Pull the fridge out, check the back lowest area (should be a big black lump of a compressor). 

Punch your fridge make into google and you might be able to find a guide on what is what. Should be a run capacitor and a relay down there. Might be the relay or capacitor popped (can get a cheap ebay special one, or try a local store for one now, maybe the local dump and trash pick one of each).

|-| cogaehc || 3 || Are you sure you don't have an additional panel, somewhere outside the house, perhaps by your meter?  A lot of times, Garage additions or other construction additions will have a sub panel that is fed from the main panel..  It sounds like you've just tripped a breaker  and maybe these receps are fed by a panel other than the one you mentioned in the garage...  

I don't want to minimize the danger of electricity, and perhaps there is more to it, but if you've just tripped a breaker some of the comments in this thread are a little bit alaramist.. 

The other thing, is depending one where you live, and how new your home is you may have some arc fault breakers feeding these receps..  AF breakers have a little yellow button on them in the sub panel, and notoriously trip at the slightest draw, and would most likely never reset or woudn't stay reset with a high draw appliance like a space heater plugged into them... |-|

It's not your house. |-| 
|-| cog0ib5 || 4 || The correct way to fix it would be to run new wiring, replacing the old circuit. I'm assuming that you do not want to do this, so go ahead and flip the breaker, hit it with electrical tape and fill the hole with a non-conductive insulator. I wouldn't recommend leaving it like this, as there is a chance it could short out and cause fire.
