|-| cnu392r || 12 || I think this is grossly overestimating the amount of base needed. Most major brands of base are designed for  1 TBL to be reconstituted with 1 Quart of water.

Factoring in the kimchi, chili paste, and jerky being relatively high sodium ingredients- I am not confident that first recipe will bode well.

Also cooked pasta is a potentially hazardous food; which means it requires time-temperature control. While on the actual source it does say to refrigerate these, I think the draw here is "stable take to work, easy store etc.", which may lead people to unsafe practices. |-|

|-| cnulka8 || 3 || This week, I happen to be staying in a hotel with a kitchenette. While my original plan was to have popcorn and an icee for dinner, showing up 30 minutes early to a showing of Selma on MLK Day meant that it was sold out. 

I decided to make the best of it, and I prepared my own dinner for a change. As I'm on the road almost constantly, there's not many opportunities to have a home cooked meal. Even when I'm home, my beautiful wife takes care of much of the cooking.

A quick run to the nearby grocery store, a nice bartender, and a little effort led to this wonderful steak dinner with mashed potatoes, green beans, and a rye whiskey manhattan.

The kitchenette had limited utensils and only 2 burners, so I had to get creative. Still, the results were delicious.

Bonus cocktail recipe (thanks to the Boston Residence Inn Fenway bartender for being patient with me):
Rye Whiskey Manhattan
2 parts Dickel's (in the photo) / Templeton (not in the photo, but amazing) Rye Whiskey
1 part sweet vermouth
3-4 dashes angostura bitter
---pour over ice---
---stir for 30 seconds---
---strain---

|-| cnuw3oi || 3 || Disclaimer: My family is German but we never lived in Germany. There are many different regional variations of schweinebraten. I do not claim this to be 'authentic'.

* 4.5lb/2kg pork shoulder roast
* 2 large onions
* 4 carrots
* 4 stalks celery
* 2 gloves minced garlic
* .5 liter dark wheat beer
* 250ml chicken stock
* 1 teaspoon caraway seed toasted and ground
* 1 tablespoon juniper berries crushed
* fresh ground pepper and salt

Roughly chop the onion, slice carrot into medallions, dice the celery, mince garlic and line your roasting pan with them. Sprinkle in the crushed juniper berries.

Score the fat cap in a criss-cross fashion without penetrating too deep into the actual meat.

Rub the roast all over with pepper, salt and caraway seed. Sprinkle some extra salt onto the fat cap.

Mix the beer and stock, pour over the vegetables. Place the pork on top and place into a 375 oven for 2 hours.

When the pork is cooked, strain the remaining liquid from the vegetables. Combine the liquid with a roux to create the sauce.

I like my schweinebraten served with red cabbage and knodel (bread or potato). I also served some of the remaining vegetables. |-| 
|-| cnuw4vv || 3 || Did you feel all jesusy after reading the bible verses on the cups and wrappers? |-| 
|-| cnuw6sm || -4 || TL;DR: In-n-out is better than any other burger place (circle jerk, but still true)

In-n-out is an interesting restaurant for several reasons, one of which being that it's somewhat famous and iconic in southern California and certain parts of Nevada (Vegas).

The way that their food is described most often in ridiculous superlatives is easier to understand when you realize that it's made from some of the best ingredients, and being sold to people who are regularly exposed to sticker shock prices of organic food stores.

What really makes In-n-out miles ahead of other premium burger places like 5 guys, the counter, or BK lounge, is that they have such good food *at such a ridiculously low price* by comparison. You'll easily pay 50% more and upwards for a decent burger anywhere else...

Which is made even more impressive when you find out that they pay their employees a decent wage ($13 some places) AND benefits. Meanwhile many other companies (not just referring to fast food) are shutting their doors, or cutting corners to make themselves more profitable than they already are and keep essentially slave wages (e.g. McDonald's, found it could save millions a year by removing an extra slice of cheese by a slice still keeps only the state minimum wage for nearly all of its fast food employees).

The quality of their food, excellent pay and benefit, comes as a surprise to me when I found out it happens to be a Christian company...every soda cup has "John 3:16" on the bottom and every milkshake cup has something similar. The skeptical part of me tends to regard corporate religious organizations with the same sort of distaste reserved for a corporation that preys upon people of faith while putting a premium on profits or a specific ideology....but they aren't any of that. In-n-out may be a religious company, but they never take a stance on anything (like the gay marriage fiasco chick fillet got themselves into), and they pay their employees well. 

As an atheist, eating there is an easy decision...my only hang up is that it's not healthy to eat cheeseburgers and French fries for every meal. |-| 
|-| cnuw7b7 || 4 || I'd take Culver's over this any day. |-| 
|-| cnuwagq || 3 || I mainly followed the Serious Eats recipe, but I added more cheese, garlic, and a pinch of nutmeg. These were so good, I got lots of requests for the recipe! I've linked my recipe below.

|-| cnuyvx5 || 4 || Over the past few months /r/food has made me very curious about Sous Vide cooking. Sunday the wife and I went and grabbed a Sansaire. Last night I prepared my first meal, a pork chop with mashed potatoes and broccoli (wife's out of town, sides are my weakness, go with what ya know).

I cooked the chop to 61c for an hour and 15. It was pretty thick, I could have gone an extra little bit. Pulled it out of the bag, seared in some butter and olive oil for a minute each side, including the sides.

Wow, that was the best pork chop ever. I got the chop at the same butcher we use all of the time, so I knew what to expect from the meat. The flavor was so "porky", I kept thinking it tasted like good bacon the entire time I was eating it.

Thanks so much to /r/food for leading me down the path of Sous Vide. |-|

|-| cnv68z3 || 3 || Pardon my lack of knowledge, but are the ants supposed to be there? |-| 
|-| cnv6bal || 7 || Looks like you need a lot more meat to go with that amount of rice. Looks tasty though.  |-| 
|-| cnv6pho || 15 || Where is this?  |-| 
|-| cnv70rw || 3 || &gt; There were 40 clams per tart. It took 8 people 13 hours to shuck them all! The tiny clams were delicious.

If 8 people spent 13 hours shucking 40 clams, thats only .38 of a clam per man-hour.... did you mean it took 8 people 13 hours to shuck all of the clams for all of the tarts?

Math aside, I'm jelly -- that looks amazing. |-| 
|-| cnv7c2c || 94 || I remember the days when the only food  in a pub was the occasional bowel of pickled onions, cubes of cheese or peanuts and if you were feeling flush you could treat yourself to a packet of pork scratchings.

|-| cnv9pvn || 6 || I'm living in Morocco this year, and it's amazing how my perception of Burger King has changed. It's actually *good* here. Much better than McDonalds. Back in the U.S., I would say the opposite is true.  

Europeans I've met here have said the same. Two Belgians were lamenting the fact that Burger King hadn't made it to their home country yet. You'd never hear that in the U.S. It's been so long since I had Burger King at home that I'm not even sure what's different, but maybe Burger King's secret would be to replicate their international strategy for menus in the U.S.?  

EDIT: Burger King Spain is much better too.  |-|

I went to the "flagship" Noma in Copenhagen and it was incredible, some of the best food I've ever had.

To learn more about Rene, I would recommend this [amazing New Yorker piece](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/11/21/the-food-at-our-feet), as well as [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJkn5-IOlSw) between David Chang of Momofuku fame and Rene from Mind of a Chef.  Anthony Bourdain dedicated an entire episode of Season 2 of Parts Unknown to Noma as well, but I doubt that is readily available online legally. |-|

**edit:**
**Chocolate + Hazelnut Donut Cake**

FOR THE DOUGH:

*  190g Butter;
* 45g    Hazelnut flour; You can also make it by mixing toasted nuts together with half of the sugar (which will absorb part of the oil)
* 170g White sugar;
* 70g Brown sugar;
* 230g Eggs; Should be roughly 5 medium eggs.
* 150g Liquid heavy cream;
* 100g Dark chocolate;
* 180g 00 Flour;
* 7g Baking powder;
* 40g Cocoa powder;

Roughly chop the dark chocolate and melt in a double boiler or in the microwave. Once melted, add the cream previously heated, stir and let cool. 

Meanwhile, place the softened butter at room temperature in the bowl of a planetary (if you do not own a planetary you can work the ingredients with an electric mixer), started to work it until it's soft and creamy. Add the white sugar, and when it is incorporated, add the brown sugar; when the mixture is well homogeneous, also add the hazelnut flour.

At this point you can add the eggs one at a time, and once done with the eggs, pour slowly in also the mixture of cream and melted chocolate. In a Bowl, sift together the cocoa powder, the flour and the baking powder.
Add the mix of powders a little at a time. When the mixture is smooth and creamy, stop the mixer. 

Pour the mixture in the mould of your choice leveling it with a spatula to spread it evenly. Cook in the oven preheated static to 180 ¬∞C for 50 minutes (160 ¬∞ for 40 minutes if convection oven). If the cake tends to darken too much, after the half hour of cooking, you can cover it with aluminum foil and continue cooking for the remaining time. Once cooked, pull it out and let it cool, then remove it from the mould by inverting it gently and let it cool completely on a wire rack.

&amp;nbsp;

FOR THE FILLING:

* 6g Gelatin sheets;
* 4 Egg Yolks;
* 125g White sugar;
* 50g Corn starch
* 500ml Milk; (It says whole milk is better but it doesn't really matter as i've used semi-skimmed milk and it was just fine)
* 180g Hazelnut paste;
* 200g Liquid heavy cream;

Put the gelatin sheets in a bowl with cold water for at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a saucepan with the heat turn off, pour in the egg yolks and sugar, knead with a whisk until mixture is smooth and fluid.

Sift the corn starch and add it in the mixture, stir with a whisk, then pour the milk in little by little, then the hazelnut paste.
When everything is well mixed up, add the liquid heavy cream. 

Cook the cream gently with medium heat, stirring constantly with a whisk until it thickens(it will start thickening when it's close to boiling temperature). Now drain the gelatin sheets and add the to the hot mixture(make sure it's well drained). and stir to melt the completely.

Transfer the cream in a large bowl and let it cool. Cover with plastic foil in contact. (You can speed up the cooling process by putting the bowl in icy water, without letting the water go in ofc); you can put the cream in the refrigerator until ready to use. 

&amp;nbsp;

FOR THE  DECORATION:

* Finely chopped dark chocolate and hazelnuts
* 200g Liquid heavy cream;

Mix part of the remaining hazelnut cream with some liquid heavy cream to make it softer and pour it on top of the cake. Then add finely chopped dark chocolate and hazelnuts. Then this part is probably up to you :D

Then I add a bit of soy sauce, Mirin, Gochujang and a tiny bit of the ramen powder (too much is too salty). Fry an egg and put it on top and then if I want it to taste more Korean add a slice of processed cheese. Sounds not too appetising but it's a quick and easy thing to make after a night of drinking (in true Korean fashion). |-|

If you're into eggs, I highly recommend cracking one into the boiling noodles about 2/3 way through the cooking process. 

The end result will be a perfectly poached egg that you can crack to create a creamy-like soup. 

Also, a sprinkling of sesame seeds and thinly sliced scallions (green onions) can really add some nice undertones. 

Oh! Definitely buy a jar of [this heavenly stuff](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BngHoeLiL.jpg). It's called "chili crisp sauce" and will take anything to that "next level" deliciousness! |-|

|-| cnxhfsa || 4 || So here's my suggestion...b/c i don't like the sauce packages that the Top Ramen things come with.  Toss the powder...all you really need is the noodles anyway - when you cook the noodles - first cook the noodles in water for a minute and to a minute and a half - the remove and let drain.  dump the water - it's overly starchy and while it thickens the sauce it's not exactly what you want.

In the rinsed pot - make your own sauce in the pot on low heat - i personally like a Soy sauce combination with other things like Fish sauce, some ground cumin and crushed red pepper.  

Once it start bubbling a little bit - add a 1/2 cub of chicken stock.  

Once it boils, you can add anything else you've prepared that is cool to cold.  Like leftover sliced chicken and mushrooms etc 

Let it come back to a boil before adding your noodles and cooking for 30 seconds then plate.  Garnish with a little thinly sliced scallions or shallots and a few dabs of sesame oil.

This will blow you away since essentially the soup base is fresh.  It's not an MSG loaded sauce package that muddles the flavor of everything that is dropped into it.

|-| cnxhx3q || -15 || That looks like it came out of my ass this morning  |-| 
|-| cnxi14d || 7 || I wanted to wait to see if this picked up any steam before I wrote out the recipe. I used this recipe as inspiration: http://www.foodrepublic.com/2014/09/29/check-out-video-spiral-vegetable-tart-then-try-rec

Now Food Republic's recipe looks great and I about used their proportions but instead of using a little creme fraiche I made my own base which I think added a quiche-y quality to it that was creamy and sage-y and yum:

I cut the vegetables with a mandolin, you don't want them to be too thin as it's more difficult to keep them stacked but you don't want them to be so thick that they don't cook through with the puff pastry (I had this issue, I think next time I'll steam them for a minute before placing them or I'll slice them thinner). 

So here's my recipe:

Ingredients
1 puff pastry shell

2 tablespoons Dijon mustard

1 cup of marscapone

2 large fresh sage leaves, chiffonaded (thinly sliced)

2 egg yolks

1 zucchinis

1 squash

5 heirloom carrots (different colors necessary if you want to get this cool look, I didn't use an eggplant but you should)

drizzle of olive oil

Salt and pepper

Directions: 

Wash the carrots, squash and zucchini and cut in lengthwise strips using a peeler or mandolin or by hand if you're crazy. Cut so as to have always show a small strip of skin for decorative purposes.

Preheat oven to 375 F. Place the pastry in a pie pan and prick several times with a fork.

Whip the marscapone until it has some air bubbles forming in it (maybe 3 minutes) and add egg yolks, whip for a little longer until they're incorporated. Add the sage and the dijon mustard, salt and pepper to taste. Spread the mixture on the puff pastry, you want there to be a nice thick layer so that your veggies stand up.

Roll a strip of zucchini into a spiral and place in the center of the dish (with the skin of the vegetable up), then surround it with a few strips of carrots and eggplant until reaching the ends of the dish.

Drizzle olive oil over all. Season with salt and pepper. 

Bake in a preheated oven for 40 minutes of cooking.

It looks and sounds complicated but once you've got those veggies cut everything else takes maybe 20 minutes! It was a hit at the potluck I brought it to! |-|

|-| cnxjszd || 17 || The text is in the link, but some context;

A bunch of us are hosting themed dinners this year where we cook meals inspired by movies/shows. Our first was a Middle-earth inspired dinner. 11 of us brainstormed some recipes and put together this meal..

Starters:
Mushroom ragu on toast (A)
We know hobbits LOVE mushrooms, so this dish is our ode to the hobbits. A rich mushroom ragu‚Äîmade with a mixture of white and wild mushrooms and flavoured with herbs‚Äîis what we‚Äôd imagine would be a popular dish in the Shire, served with some freshly toasted slices of bread.
 
Cheese Platter (B) - 4 assorted hard cheeses
Cheese makes a regular appearance on Middle Earth tables. Much like cheeses of today, we think that each region would have their own cheeses‚Äîfrom the way they are made to the way they are stored and ages. We‚Äôre mostly basing our cheese platter on cheese from the Shire. Since Tolkien seemed to have base a lot of the life of hobbits on rural England, we‚Äôre opting to feature hard cheeses‚Äîcheeses that would last for a while and can also travel easily (for our adventurous hobbits). Preferably U.K. cheeses, or equivalent/similar Canadian cheeses.
 
Cured and cold meats (C) ‚Äì 4 assorted
While most of our Middle Earth travellers dined on simple fare of bread, butter, and cheeses, there were occasions when they would have larger meals and these would surely have featured some meats. Surely nothing as grand as roasted meats that would be served during a grand feast, but there would likely have been some cold roast meats (think leftover roast beef, ham, or chicken), sausages (dried and cured), and terrines. Please avoid Italian cured meats, if possible. Would be great if the terrine was homemade though, but not necessary.
 
Bread and butter (D) ‚Äì 2-3 assorted loaves
Bread is probably the most common thing we see the folks of Middle Earth eat. It‚Äôs the basics of any good host‚Äôs table and hospitality. Breads of that time and age would likely have used something like a sourdough leavener, so crusty sourdoughs are ideal. Grained/seeded crusty bread and/or rye breads are also great options. Please also pick up some butter to serve alongside the bread.
 
Mains:
Grilled whole fish (E)
While Rohan is land-locked, there are many lakes and rivers that run through their country, which offers their residents freshwater fish. We won‚Äôt force you to eat Eowyn‚Äôs‚Ä¶questionable fish stew she served the future King of Gondor. We think the Rohirrim‚Äôs cooking style would likely be on a spit over the hearth, on sticks over an open fire, or could very well have been dried or smoked to preserve for the harsher, winter months. We‚Äôve opted to serve the fish simply grilled, whole. Pick a freshwater fish‚Äîtrout or salmon are freshwater fishes that can usually be found whole at fish/seafood shops.
 
Coney (rabbit) stew (F)          
In ‚ÄúOf Herbs and Stewed Rabbit‚Äù (The Two Towers), Gollum catches two small rabbits, which Sam turns into stew (much to the disdain of Gollum). Alas, no po-ta-toes in this stew, but Sam does send Gollum out to find some wild herbs (‚ÄúA few bay-leaves, some thyme and sage, will do‚Äù) to help flavour the meagre stew. He would have likely also been able to find some wild onions, wild greens and wild root vegetables (who knows‚Ä¶maybe even some wild Ithilien mushrooms?!?) to help add depth and flavour to the stew, if he so wanted to.
 
Roast leg of lamb (G)
While food in the Shire and Rohan contained more simple fare and flavours, we envisioned Gondor‚Äôs dishes to be more rich and flavourful. It‚Äôs a large city, and it would have been possible to have imported various spices and exotic ingredients via the Anduin before the Ring War. Apparently, Tolkien also based Gondor largely on the Byzantium culture, so we‚Äôre taking quite some creative liberty with our interpretation of a Gondorian dish. Lamb would have been available to the upper middle and higher class Byzantines‚Äîwhich could also very be likely in the royal seat of Minas Tirith.
 
Sides:
Lembas bread (D)                 
‚ÄúOne will keep a traveller on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be one of the tall Men of Minas Tirith.‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúFarewell to L√≥rien‚Äù, The Fellowship of the Ring
I don‚Äôt think I need to say much about this Elven bread, but here are a few things to note about lembas:
¬∑        It is cream-coloured on the inside with a light brown crust.
¬∑        It is thin.
¬∑        It is sweet.
¬∑        It contains ‚Äúfruit of the Mallorn Tree‚Äù ‚Äì We can creatively interpret this and use a tree nut of some sort. Walnut, almonds or macadamia nuts might be good options, as they are light in colour.
¬∑        It is wrapped in mallorn leaf ‚Äì We can either wrap them in banana leaves (which can be found in Asian stores), or make our own wrapping.
¬∑        The film interpretation has the lembas shaped in triangular loaves.
¬∑        The film also shows the bread having a crumbly texture when broken, much like a shortbread.
 
Cabbage braised in ale and salted pork (H)
A hearty vegetable we would readily see growing in farms across the Shire. Since the hobbits love their ales, we decided to braise the cabbage in the brew, and add some salted pork for added flavour.
                       
Boiled potatoes (H)
‚ÄúPo-ta-toes! Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.‚Äù ‚Äì Samwise Gamgee, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (film)
Hobbits, especially Samwise, love their potatoes. We‚Äôre doing a simple preparation here‚Äîboiled, then buttered and tossed with some herbs, salt, and pepper. We think Sam would approve.
 
Herb salad (A)
Herbs can help dress up the plainest of meals. And with wild herbs growing in wild abundance, it wouldn‚Äôt have been hard for our Middle Earth fellowship to forage for some herbs to compose a flavourful salad. Parsley leaves, chives, tarragon, and dill, mixed with arugula, dandelion greens or microgreens would be a salad that one could easily throw together, even out in the wild of Middle Earth.
  
Desserts:
Honey cakes (I)
Gimli mentions the honey cakes of the Beornings while he‚Äôs tasting the lembas bread. They are a twice-baked cake that, obviously, is sweetened with honey. We imagine this is would be a rich, dense, sweet, sticky cake.
 
Blackberry tarts (J)
The books also reveal the hobbits‚Äô love for blackberries. Our hobbits‚Äô meal at the Prancing Pony also included a blackberry tart. We think this tart would be more jammy‚Äîso that they could enjoy blackberry tarts at any time of the year, even during the off-season. Hobbits are great preservers (with reference to jams in The Hobbit), so it wouldn‚Äôt be a surprise to find blackberry jam (and other jams) in any pantry.
 
Drinks:
Beer/Ale/Mead (K)
Wines (L) - Reds

|-| cogw8tn || 191 || And he's right!

GMO is a tool. And a very useful one. There have been shady uses of GMO (e.g., Monsanto creating and patenting strains resistant to their herbicide), but that's true of any tool; you can build a house with a hammer or clobber someone's brain with one. Just because GMO *can* be misused doesn't mean that it is inherently bad. And the most effective way to counter these kinds of things isn't to label food, but to enact government regulations that establish appropriate boundaries.

The problem with GMO labeling is two-fold. First, it does not give consumers any useful information. Since GMOs are not unsafe or unhealthy, what does that serve? But that in itself is not sufficient to oppose labeling. If everyone was science-literate and realizes that virtually everything we've eaten for centuries are GMO foods and that there is absolutely nothing wrong with GMO, then great, label away. Not that anyone would care in such a scenario. But that's not the case. [The gap between the public's perception and the scientific consensus](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/29/public-and-scientists-views-on-science-and-society/) is enormous when it comes to the topic of GMOs--even wider than that of global warming, vaccinations, and evolution. With the huge amount of misinformation and pseudo-science floating around, labeling just serves to fuel this misinformation and give credence to unfounded beliefs (the average person will likely think, "There must be something wrong with GMO, if they are forced to label it!"). Look at the number of people who now think that gluten is somehow inherently bad when the labeling of gluten was only meant to inform a small population with celiac disease. Now imagine the misinformation and harm that can arise if that labeling is backed by a vocal group of misinformed people.

Actually, you don't need to imagine. You need only look at Europe and what happened to GMO foods there when they required labeling--GMO was basically driven out of the European market.

Finally, as we battle much more important problems--like global warming, water scarcity, overpopulation, and land overuse--we **absolutely need** GMOs. Even if you think that GMOs are evil (which, again, is unfounded), can you at least agree that doubling food production to sustain the world's burgeoning population is going to be environmentally disastrous if it required double the land, water, etc.?

[The National Geographic's piece on challenges of feeding the world in the future](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/foodfeatures/green-revolution/) is something that any GMO detractor should read. And yes, they do take a very balanced approach to it and look at all the solutions, including organic ones. But it's also impossible to deny that GMOs are the reason why our world is not yet a Malthusian mess.

PS: [It's not just Tyson.](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/labels-for-gmo-foods-are-a-bad-idea/) [The vast majority of the scientific community is in agreement.](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/29/public-and-scientists-views-on-science-and-society/) GMO denial is not unlike global warming denial, except most of the deniers this time are politically liberal. But science isn't political. It's the truth, and it doesn't care what preconceptions you have. |-| 
|-| cogyyx4 || 12 || Why is everyone bashing NDT for being a physicist and talking about GMOs? How many of you have degrees in biology and fight tooth and nail for one direction or another?

Further more, as soon as an article comes out about these push button issues people fly off the handle and start putting words where they weren't and assuming they know everything about what the author/speaker intended. All NDT was saying was that he does NOT support NOR fight GMOs, only that they have played a role in our development as humans (which they have) and that if they continue to be used that they should all be tested on their affect on us as humans and the affect they have on the world around us (a scientific belief to test everything from a physicist) before being released. |-| 
|-| coh03m2 || 5 || TL;DR - Genetically modified foods can be good or bad. Depends on how it is managed. If used properly GMO foods can be of great benefit to society. The idea of genetic modification is a lot older than we think. Also, natural doesn't always mean good. It depends on the individual, and their specific needs.

|-| cogwyco || 25 || My husband just started college. His final project this semester for his introductory English class is a project about GMOs (assigned by the professor). In reading the prompt and support documents the professor is basically handing out anti-GMO propaganda to his class. He is citing a study that has been disproven about how dangerous GMOs are (he doesn't even cite the study just vaguely says a French study has proven GMOs are bad for human health) and included a lot of statements that are straight up fear mongering and cases of causation equaling correlation. Many of his statements literally say and mean nothing. I am reading the packet the professor has compiled asking myself why he is doing this, why he is willing to lie to an entire class of students instead of encouraging them to think about the topic or seek out current information. 

It makes me angry. My husband is lucky enough that I have a science degree and can explain to him why his professor is wrong but the other students in his class don't have this. They don't have someone to talk about these things with and come to educated, well thought out decisions, they will believe their professor as they should be able to. 

I know it is silly but I sure wish there was something I could do about this. It isn't even a difference of opinion, the professor is using untruths and flawed studies that have since been retracted to further his agenda.  |-| 
|-| cogw2dy || 51 || He almost hit the nail on the head, when he said "if the regulatory system isn't sufficient to ensure it's tested, it should be changed" (paraphrasing). 

The companies involved are not interested in helping make the world a better place. They just want your money and if they have to lobby for a less rigorous regulatory framework to support that objective they will. |-| 
|-| cogvybo || 26 || To the people who are saying he shouldn't try to teach people about GMOs because he "only" is a physicist, what PhD in genetic engineering you don't have qualifies you to do so?


Even though it might not be his field but that doesn't mean he could not educate himself on the topic well enough to form a very decent opinion on it.


His post is as neutral as it should be. He is not taking sides and tries to get you thinking about how GMOs are treated in today's society. |-| 
|-| cogxoan || 9 || For me, the biggest difference between the "aurox-&gt;holstein cow" example and modern lab gmo is the speed of it.  

It took many generations for the first - all in baby steps.  
If there were any more problems with it other than the known lactose intolerance, we would have seen it over time and the damage would have been small.  

modern GMO seeds take huge steps (what would have taken selective breeding of 10+ generations) in one single iteration and - after testing it - spread it across the world within a few years.  

If any problems show up after a few years of wild usage with all those factors you simply can't all test, they might be of catastrophic dimensions.  

I'm not talking about zombie apocalypse but about something on the level of the bee problem we are facing today. |-| 
|-| coh0jgy || 4 || GMOs and vaccines show that liberals can go toe-to-toe with right-wing lunatics in the forum of ignorant science-denial. |-| 
|-| cogznhk || 7 || At this point, this will probably get buried unfortunately... I'm a graduate student in plant breeding.  Nobody in this thread (including Tyson) understands the difference between traditional breeding and genetic engineering.  
  
Yes, all of today's crops are the products of selective breeding over centuries, but they were developed by making crosses and selecting superior progeny.  This means that all the genes they have were already in the plant's genome.  They were just selected for.  
  
A GMO is a "genetically modified organism."  This means that it has a gene or genes inserted into its genome from an outside organism.  This is usually done with tissue culture and a vector species (*agrobacterium tumefaciens*), but it may also be done with a device called a "gene gun."  
  
Long story short- I'm in favor of both techniques, but it's the actual GMOs that are controversial, not the traditionally bred varieties.  As a side note, GMO crops have been cultivated and consumed for over 20 years now, and there has never been a single documented case of any negative effects on human health.

EDIT: Agrobacterium tumefaciens is used, NOT E. coli.  I knew that.  My bad.  Thanks to /u/Slimjeezy for pointing it out. |-| 
|-| cogwj39 || 10 || I always point this out to food hippies at partyies who go on about natural foods...everything we eat has been modified by man, wheat is grass, vegetables and fruit are bloated mutants of the originals, the only natural thing we take in is water if you discount the additives from the water companies.
My concern as many have stated apart from one company being in charge is that this wonderful new technology will end up due to short term greed the same as antibiotics...thrown aside by evolution of the pest. |-|

|-| cogw8rs || -6 || Here's the issue which he doesn't touch on and conveniently ignores.... Roundup resistant GMO crops are drenched in roundup-- that is what is bad for the human body. It's simple and I don't need to be a trendy physicist who everyone suddenly worships to understand this. |-| 
|-| cogv2oo || -6 || This is what happens when the internet becomes full of "science fans" instead of science literate people and they obsess over one guy.  Can we please stop treating Neil deGrasse Tyson as an authority on everything.  His comments on GMO should never have traveled as far as they did.  He should be allowed to voice his opinion on a subject without the consequences of it being published everywhere as if he were an authority.  We hand out PHds in specific fields for a reason.  |-| 
|-| cogx0fr || -5 || There is clearly a difference in naturally modifying a plant and artificially making new genes in a laboratory. Not saying it's all bad but lets not act like they're the same exact thing. Yes the labeling should show so much more, but they don't want to do that, just look at what recently happened with the whole herbal supplements scam. |-| 
|-| cogyj2a || -4 || Who the fuck cares what N dG Tyson think's about GMO? |-| 
|-| cogyjkl || -3 || Someone should just post a picture of what corn looked like before it was bread to what it is today. If that doesn't make people think GMOs are good, then they're stupid and go back to eating rocks |-| 
|-| coguk59 || -11 || Oh Neil, you are a smart man but you don't understand people. They hold opinions because they approached the issue rationally and let the facts dictate their position. They have emotional responses that are tied into their self identity. They're attacking him for things he didn't say because their anti-GMO(when it's called GMO). They don't need to be educated because they already know where they're *supposed* to be in terms of their opinion. It's part of pretentiousness, part tribal group think (it doesn't matter how ridiculous the view becomes in face of evidence, as it shifts to becoming about loyalty to their "tribe").

I don't have an opinion on GMO foods myself, I don't care for Monsanto's business practices that I hear about (though who knows how accurate those accounts are).  |-| 
|-| cogx999 || -6 || I can bet you, the people who
make more money will be eating organic,
including the same scientists that endorse gmos. 

Right now Neil deGrasse is eating a gmo glutenf msg
free banana.

People less likely to eat organics, are the poor
people, less intelligent, since its pushed onto them. |-| 
|-| cogwrk9 || -4 || He's kinda putting "domestication" (artificial selection), "breeding" (artificial reproduction), and in vitro genome engineering ("modern GMOs") in the same bag. While these processus have some common goals they definitely don't have the same practical power. A shitty yet globally fine analogy would be to consider the natural world as the market of Lego sets. Domestication would be like if kids only bought Star Wars sets but no LoTR sets at all; breeding would be kids making their own Star Wars-like creation that don't exists in the actual movies; modern GMOs would be kids literally breaking appart Lego pieces to make completely new shit. While you are at risk of fucking up somewhere in all 3 processus, the risk is significantly different between them, especially with GMO. With domestication you're at risk of losing some Lego pieces diversity if LoTR sets end up disappearing from the market; with breeding you're at risk making something that doesn't really function as intended in the Star Wars universe since it wasn't made by Lego or George Lucas (i.e. == the mighty natural selection); but with modern GMO you're risk poking yourself in the eye with a sharp torned apart Lego piece and end up spilling blood on all the rest of your official and in perfect condition Lego sets. Quite a difference, indeed. And you could follow-up on this crappy analogy with regulations, you can have regulations on plastic composition so it's not toxic or on the age required to play with Lego so kids don't choke on it, how do you regulate if I start melting my Lego pieces and 3D print an AR15 receiver with it?  |-| 
|-| cogxzo7 || -6 || Unbelievable. Look at all of these comments supporting GMO. 

These are all from the very same people who were *against* GMO just yesterday too... Until they heard that NGT supports this, that is. This shows just how obsessed his groupies are with the guy- they have no problem flip flopping their own deepseated personal beliefs instantaneously and throwing support to a corporate agenda that is both morally reprehensible and environmentally disastrous! Y'all need to learn to think for yourselves, not just blindly follow NGT around like he's the leader of some midnight blood cult.

By the way, do you know exactly how many college biology classes it takes to obtain a Ph.D in Physics, like Neil has? Only one... Just one!!! To fulfill a life sciences undergrad requirement for the bachelors degree, usually taken in Freshman or Sophomore year because only basic bio 101 is required to graduate. NGT has no more education in biology than anybody else does, in fact less than many people I know. So he should stick to what he does best- studying other planets, and making grossly uneducated &amp; patently ignorant comments about areas that he knows absolutely nothing about, because he knows that his groupies will spread his opinions far and wide regardless of merit, simply in order to feed his own oversize ego! |-| 
|-| cogyt6o || -5 || Why am i reading what a physicist says on GMOs? I mean i get that hes a smart bloke but his expertise lie elsewhere.  |-| 
|-| cogymi1 || -4 || Why are we listening to a physicist telling us about GMOs? Imagine the reaction if I posted a video of an engineer talking about vaccines and autism. |-| 
|-| cogx46w || -7 || It's a thread about Neil deGrasse Tyson again, America's superhero science guy.
Let us all swallow and agree with what he says, because noone can be wrong if they are on tv.

Yawn. |-|

|-| cogyn18 || -6 || TYSON... Wtf Bro! Try to stay OUT of an argument here or there, man! We here your opinions enough everywhere else, now here too? You're like the kid in class who raises his hand and answers every question before anyone else has a chance...enough dude.  |-| 
|-| cogyo30 || -5 || You know..... You guys talk so much shit about hippies denying facts and all. But when facts come out you shut them down, and anybody stands up for HUMANITY you are gonna shut them down too. 

WHY IN THE FUCKING LITERAL FUCK would you blame a scared population over some of the most corrupt corporations in the world....

 |-| 
|-| cogx40s || -6 || As long as GMO's are fairly labeled... I mean science findings are updated all the time, and just because they couldn't find anything harmful in it yet, doesn't mean they won't find it 10 years from now.

I'm of course no scientist and can't prove any of those, but if I have to pay extra for non-GMO, I'm willing to do it. |-| 
|-| cogw1cx || -7 || This will be hilarious! Science science science but not when it come GMOs or Monsanto (or Organic) because we don't need science to just "know" what's right there. Can we talk about climate change instead? |-| 
|-| cogw9iy || -9 || Uninsightful comments which are confusing and come from somone who is missing some subtlety on the facts.  |-| 
|-| cogv27m || -42 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| cogx4pm || -3 || GMO's need to grow as well as non-GMO crop. Just look what GMO fields do to our environment! |-| 
|-| cogy0w7 || -3 || What he is saying is different from the typical liberal/scientific consensus that GMO's can do no harm, even with the modifier that that agricultural practices that change our food are equally harmful, which doesn't take into account that GMO's can produce changes much more quickly than agricultural practices.

Of course Gluten products should be labeled.  |-| 
|-| cogyph2 || -3 || Bread is clearly GMO since it contains yeast which is hybridization of bacteria.  |-|

|-| cogu9t5 || 8 || I was so impressed by the food when I went to Finland. It's been a while so I don't remember the Finnish words for everything but highlights were: 


Thin crepe-like pancakes cooked outside on a griddle at a m√∂kki (summer cabin). 


Karelian potato pies with egg butter (my favorite!) 


Fried herring with white sauce bought at the Kauppatori market. 


Blood sausage with lingonberry jam (more of a Swedish thing I think but I bought one in Tampere). 


A popular dish at the amusement park in Helsinki was just pieces of hot dogs mixed with french fries... Really simple but surprisingly tasty. 


Rainbow sprinkles that are fruit flavored on your ice cream! 


And of course fisu shots with the locals! 


Loved Finland. Beautiful country, friendly people. Had a great time!!
