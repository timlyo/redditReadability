Our Marketing team has actually been playing around with the idea of using more animals in our adverts, so clearly this is the way to go. We're actually just about to launch a new contest called #AnimalsFromACanon and we would love to see what the creative people over at reddit could come up with. Feel free to check us out on twitter or Facebook for more updates. Have a wonderful day, /r/aww.  |-|

|-| cntxfbk || 12 || OP, I wrote a song for you called "I've Got A Dog In My Pocket" by writing new lyrics for The White Stripes tune "You've Got Her In Your Pocket". Sorry if this hits you too hard in the feels; your post just got me thinking about when my dog was that little...and how he grew up. You can listen/read the lyrics here:

|-| cnu33h0 || 3 || Actually, I think that's how cats show politeness.  They [tend to face away from those they trust, and stare at those they consider to be a threat](http://lovemeow.com/2009/12/the-power-of-cat-staring/).  Seems that that's your cat's way of telling you that she loves you, in her own roundabout way. |-| 
|-| cnu4bo4 || 3 || Ferocious! (and by ferocious...I mean cute-ly so) |-| 
|-| cnu4h5g || 4 || She's beautiful! |-| 
|-| cnu4k6s || 10 || Aahh, The Back. What cats use because they can't extend their middle finger.  |-| 
|-| cnu4ouv || 4 || So floofy! |-| 
|-| cnu560q || -30 || Cute, but please try to adopt at the local shelter first. |-| 
|-| cnu5773 || -40 || How does the Indians view cats..? Is it a good thing or bad thing to reborn as a cat? |-| 
|-| cnu5c93 || 5 || She's a sweet ole girl.... |-| 
|-| cnu5jlg || -20 || Why can't people just say they took a cool pic?  You just need to make up a fake story about blowing on ears, having you camera ready for this exact second. |-| 
|-| cnu5mer || -51 || Pet stores are horrible places, I wish people wouldn't patronize them. Adorable kitty though. Downvote the shit out of me, I don't give a damn. |-| 
|-| cnu6t4l || 11 || Did you mean Maple or Apple? |-| 
|-| cnu6vpo || 11 || Whatttttt Happened!!! WOOF WOOF OMG!! ;D |-| 
|-| cnu7afi || -26 || Don't like pet stores selling animals, but glad he's getting a home. |-| 
|-| cnu7gq4 || 77 || I've never understood why a lot of dogs love sticking their head out the window of a moving car, but hate when you blow on their ears. I feel like it's the same exact thing, but the window's more intense.  |-| 
|-| cnu81b3 || 89 || To those worried about OP buying the cat at a pet store, it's just as possible that the store has an agreement with the local shelter to display adoptable pets or staged an adoption day.  

I'm pretty sure PetSmart does this all the time. |-| 
|-| cnu81vt || 3 || Wishing her many more years of love and kindness.  She's truly lovely. |-| 
|-| cnu8q42 || 7 || She looks like a judgmental Mother-in-law...just add pearls. |-|

 |-| 
|-| cnu9iki || 36 || Yeah, dogs despise that shit. He's cute when he's mad though.  |-| 
|-| cnu9l2c || 4 || Mapplethorpe? |-| 
|-| cnu9pvd || 9 || Those sharp tiny teeth.  My dog ripped apart my skin with cuteness.  |-| 
|-| cnu9qjy || 6 || Violet is beautiful! What kind of dog is she?  |-| 
|-| cnu9sxl || 3 || He looks like Littlefoot. |-| 
|-| cnu9vvf || -9 || He's touching that mouse just like Jenny touched Zack's penis a little bit. |-| 
|-| cnu9xz3 || 11 || He looks like a happy little otter. |-| 
|-| cnu9yqb || 5 || He's trying to uncover the cat underneath that mouse  |-| 
|-| cnuac86 || 3 || Poor doggy :-( |-| 
|-| cnuaczy || 189 || Mailman makes friends with your dog. Then breaks in when your not home. Dog doesn't do anything while he robs your home. Oldest trick in the book. |-|

|-| cnuclbp || 28 || My moms dog looks just like that one and we started doing that.  We started blowing on his neck when he was a puppy and now he puts his neck on everyone mouth.  I think we just trained a dog to suffocate people. |-|

Sometimes at night she just starts howling, and she never howled until the night the collie wasn't there. |-|

|-| cnuiwc4 || 765 || My old dog used to sit by the mail box everyday so she could get a treat. When she got older, she had cancer in her mouth, so hard treats were too much for her. The mail man made special treats just for her to eat since she waited for him everyday for the past seven years. Nicest mailman I ever had.  |-|

|-| cnute58 || 10 || When I was little my mum had a small terrier type dog named "titch". Being the 80's I guess it was normal to just let your dog out to roam, which she did every day or two.  She would let titch out the front, and without fail she would be back in the afternoon perfectly fine.

One day she began to arrive home with bags of lollies tied to her collar, which was awesome for us kids, because we got free lollies. This started to happen every week, and eventually one day when titch came home and we opened the door to let her in we found an old man and his german shepherd were with her holding a bag of lollies.

It turns out every day titch would travel 3 blocks down to come play with the old mans shepherd, which he was thrilled about because he was too old to exercise his boy, and titch would come and play with him and then cuddle the old man. He started tying lollies to her collar to thank us for letting her visit. 

Eventually when we moved my parents decided since titch and the german shepherd were such great pals they offered to leave titch with them, to which he agreed. No doubt she spent the rest of her life with the old man and his shepherd :)  |-|

He jumped out of the back window after it shattered and he sprinted away. We had no time to catch up to him before I needed to be rushed to the hospital. He is super sweet and friendly so we had given up hope that someone would return him to us because we had just changed his colar and it didn't have his tags on. He was wandering on his own for 15 days before an old couple found him sleeping on their porch. They took him in and fed him and cared for him for a while before deciding to call the local shelters to see if someone was looking for him. We got a call finally today saying he had been found!!!

|-| cnvc9k0 || 4 || That brings back memories.  I had a big beautiful black lab named duke.  There was a girl dog named sissy who was adorable and kind of a whore.. She would come by our house, usually with a pack of other dogs (though she was clearly the leader) and bark for us to let duke out.  Then they'd romp around or chill in our yard all day.  But not before demanding pets from the humans.  It got where duke would get super excited whenever he heard her or even when we said the name "sissy."  It was so damn adorable.  It sucked when they got older and she couldn't come around anymore :/ ..but for a while, I know duke felt like a king and had some happy times. |-|

|-| cnvim6d || 80 || Glad - very very glad you found your dog.  As a tip to others, leash or harness your pets in the car.  We travelled extensively in an RV and kept our pets crated while moving. In the car, they are crated (cat) or leashed for this very reason.  30 years ago, my friend was traveling across county and stopped at a rest stop. He got bumped when someone backed out.  He absent mindedly got out to asses the damage and left the door open.  12 hours + later of him and wife chasing a cat across the interstate he got back on the road ( happy ending ).  It's so easy to just have a simple fender bender or to hop out to check something and forget about the pet and have them run off.  In the stress of even a small accident anyone could forget they had a pet in the vehicle.  Heck as a kid, we left our dog at a campground "cause she always jumped in a started car" and had to drive back two hours where she was waiting for us at the camp site. Pets do dumb things and don't act the same when they are not in their home environment. 
TL;DR always harness or crate your pets when driving.  |-| 
|-| cnvimyg || 12 || Oh man, was anyone taking care of your dog while you were lost? |-|

|-| cnvipeb || 10 || I had an female English Setter that was like that.  I had talked a fellow into giving her to me, because he kept her under poor conditions, and I just kept remembering her looking at me, like, dude, get me out of here.  About 4 months later I did, and she had to snuggle up to me like that, if I was every away more than a couple of days. |-|

|-| cnvk4lc || 17 || When I pass away at some point, one of my largest regrets in life will be leaving my cat on my dads farm in Michigan and not bringing him to Florida right away when I first moved there.  This was 4 years ago now, and every few weeks I break down in remorse still.  He is 14 now, living what appears to be a happy life among the farm animals, but I will never get over the fact that I couldn't explain to him that he didn't do anything wrong, that I simply couldn't bring him with me at the time, that he was my best buddy on the planet and that I love him.  When the time came that I could finally move him, my step-mother claimed him and said I can't have him.  I go up at least once a year with the main goal being to visit him.  I just wish I could talk to him. |-|

I would have to be faced with hells fire to part with my dogs. They are the most loyal companions one could ever hope for. Their only betrayal is swiping some stray food left on the counter. 

I genuinely think that after my ex left, the dogs were worried I would as well. Then when I moved, they were visibly shaken.

I had the privilege of being able to tell the owner, as she was on the stretcher being loaded in the ambulance, that her dog had been caught and was in good hands. My good deed for the day.

What we're seeing right now is commonly referred to as "The Hunt" and despite its name, is not a *real* hunt, but more of a scouting phase to see how prey reacts to certain environmental situations to accomodate for "The Final Meow," which is when the real hunt occurs.

She ALWAYS wraps her tail the other way though... counter-clockwise, I'd guess you would say.  I asked if I could have her tail wrap clockwise for this image, and they said no.  I got a message from the client halfway through, saying that for the first time ever, the cat sat with her tail wrapped the other way, and that I could change it if I wanted... too late.

Anyway... cool picture. |-|

Edit: Our neighbor found our poodle and brought him to the animal emergency hospital, but they couldn't do anything for him. His legs were basically torn off and they were just pumping him full of painkillers until our family was able to say goodbye. It was my first pet ever and my first true experience with death. |-|

Her dog went from no visible symptoms to death in less than 24 hours.  They came home from being gone a few hours and the dog was seizing on the floor.  They rushed her immediately to a vet, then a specialist but they could never stabilize her.  

If the disease is caught before it becomes acute, the symptoms can be easily managed with long term medication.  This is one of the known issues with the breed:

 |-| 
|-| cnxyfsn || 3 || To answer a few questions:

How can I get a fox: You have to live in a state that allows foxes to be owned and IMPORTED (if you cannot find an in-state breeder)

Is it tame: Foxes have been domesticated. Like this one, she seems to be tame but also not harmful. Still a bit wild.

Should I get one: Probably not. They are not like dogs. While they are canines, they are MUCH more high maintenance and yield tons and tons and tons of responsibilities. Also, every fox is different and some may not be suited for living inside, especially if you can't get past the very very strong scent of their urine (buy some fox urine at WalMart or your local hunting shop to get an idea. Those foxes are fed primarily protein-rich foods such as red meat but regardless, it still stinks and can be pretty unbearable). Not everyone is suited to be a fox owner. Yes, they are beautiful and awesome and totez cayoot but that is not a reason to get an animal. I think birds are gorgoeus but I will not get one because they are too much work and I feel like I wouldn't give them the care they'd need. You have to actually bond with this particular animal to enjoy the full experience.

What does it say: Sorry, you're not clever. We hear this all the time.

|-| cny050s || 1348 || You found him in a rusty boat?! Let me tell you about a cat I found in a boat as well.

I used to work at a boat repair facility in Florida. A guy brought in his quarter-million dollar 4-engine sport fishing boat on its trailer for routine service. Modern fiberglass boats are made of two parts btw, an outer shell and an inner shell that are bonded together.

It was close to quitting time, so our normally loud and busy shop became very quiet as the few of us designated to "lock up" started turning off the lights to go home for the night. Our manager suddenly yelled out "Quick, guys, come here!". We thought he had hurt himself. We all gathered round and he shushed us to be quiet.

In the stillness we heard it... "meewww ...meeww mewww". A litter of kittens. A momma cat had somehow gotten into the 4" diameter round access port inside this boat. That opening lets a tech access the electrical lines that run BETWEEN the outer shell of the boat and inner shell. When the guy towed in his boat for service, the momma cat abandoned the litter since the boat was gone.

The kittens were at least 10 feet from the closest point anyone could reach, and around a curved bulkhead. There was no way to get them out. That boat had sat in the hot sun all day as well. Those kittens were probably dehydrated or in heat stress.

Four burly, bearded boat techs all immediately went into panic mode. We HAD to get those kittens out somehow. We called up the owner of our shop who was there in minutes. He immediately called up the boat owner and told him the following...

"We need to cut a 3 foot by 3 foot hole through the bottom of your boat." He told him why. The owner initially said "no way!", and I kind of understand. This was a quarter-million dollar boat after all. However, the owner calmly explained the following, "If they die they'll stink up your boat like you can't imagine, and that smell will never go away because you can't access that area to clean it. Your boat will stink too much for you to enjoy it and no one will want to buy it off you with that smell. Let us cut the hole, we'll cover the cost of re-fiberglassing &amp; painting the area so that no one would ever know it happened". The guy thought about it a minute, but he really had no choice, so he said "Ok, do it".

The kittens were out 30 minutes later. Every one of them was jet black with white bellies. They were taken to a vet and re-hydrated and checked. They were about 5 weeks old, almost weened. By the time the vet had released them a couple days later, each mechanic had committed to adopting one.

I was one of those mechanics, and [here is Pogo](http://i.imgur.com/uBv3PRH.jpg), just a week or two after we brought him home. He's 10 years old now. We named him that because he bounced around everywhere. I was a hold-out at first, I told everyone I'd just "foster" him till a good home came along. Yeah, that attitude lasted about a day. Me and the wife fell in love with him from the moment he started romping around our house. |-|

An *actual* [teeny tiny tinsy wincy baby crow](http://www.stevebartlettphotography.com/img/s9/v93/p1606950330-3.jpg) looks quite a bit different!  
  
  Baby crows are [altricial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altricial), which means they're naked and helpless at birth. They don't really start looking like crows until they're nearly ready to leave the nest.  
  
  Baby rails are [precocial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocial), which means they're feathered and relatively able to care for themselves right after hatching. Chicks (as in baby chickens) are like this.  
  
  Baby birds often look quite different than adults. For example, a [baby Gouldian Finch](https://ladygouldian.com/files/images/Year%20in%20the%20Life%20Photo5A.jpg) looks like a mutant dinosaur; an [adult Gouldian Finch](http://www.efinch.com/birdpix4/gouldian/rhgould.jpg) is beautiful and elegant! |-|

|-| co0usq5 || 27 || Here's the thing. You said a "jackdaw is a crow."
Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.
As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.
If you're saying "crow family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.
So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people "call the black ones crows?" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.
Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.
It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know? |-|

She turned out to be an awesome that left us with lots of fun and cool memories. She ended up with additional names like Pork Chop (Rocko's Modern Life), Louie (which was first Stir Fry Louie [blame my dad]), but she was cool dog that was my first dog and set the bar high for all the dogs that have come after.

|-| co0ati8 || -3 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| co0b1e7 || -4 || I really hope it was an adoption or rescue and not a pet store/puppy mill purchase. |-| 
|-| co0bhy8 || -4 || Assuming this story is true, please take this puppy to a vet right away. Puppies purchased in pet stores come from puppy mills (or occasionally, backyard breeders) and may have a number of health problems as a result. Getting a checkup right away to ensure that he doesn't have parvo-- which is often fatal in puppies, but has a better chance of being treatable the earlier you catch it-- is the smart thing to do. |-| 
|-| co0dte8 || -8 || [deleted] |-| 
|-| co0arfy || -3 || No you didn't |-| 
|-| co0b59j || -3 || Really hope you had been planning on getting a dog and this was a fortunate find! A dog is a 12+ year commitment that is both financially and time intensive. A puppy is cute, but a bad impulse buy. |-|

|-| co13z59 || 3 || My heart has melted into a million pieces looking at that adorable pup pup face. I am getting married this year and unfortunately the venue won't allow pets to be there. I just got out of bed and hugged our dog while she was sleeping to kiss her and apologize for the fact that she won't be at our wedding.  |-| 
|-| co12yw6 || 3 || She knows this is special. |-| 
|-| co0dur5 || 178 || Well technically the 92" tall teddy bear that Costco sells is also a toy. So I think you are OK.  |-| 
|-| co0cyz4 || 442 || FYI that dog will always consider itself a lap dog, no matter how big it gets.  |-| 
|-| co0enqb || 127 || Adorable!  But I hope you weren't already mentally prepared for the food and vet bills of a toy breed because, well ... you're going to be in for a shock. |-| 
|-| co0lgw0 || 22 || Beware of the slobber on the walls. I sometimes find it at head height.  |-| 
|-| co0hu5x || 42 || Congratulations on your new horse. 
But seriously though he's cute  |-| 
|-| co0kkg2 || 257 || Please be aware of the significant health risks that plague giant breeds-- gastric torsion, bone cancers-- and sign up for pet health insurance now. Or start putting away a sizeable chunk of savings. 

Giant breeds are wonderful in many ways but they have relatively short lifespans, partially because of their capacity for these significant illnesses. Not trying to be a downer but it's better to be aware! |-| 
|-| co0l5gq || 18 || I have a mastiff/st Bernard x and he doesn't cost a lot to feed. It's very easy to over feed big breeds because you think they need it. 

You can't beat mastiffs for loyalty and temperament. Enjoy him - he's a beauty! |-| 
|-| co0ib19 || 38 || That thing's gonna leave a larger than human sized turd on the floor one day. Soon in fact.  |-| 
|-| co0nw88 || 17 || Super cute dog! The poster who mentioned gastric torsion as a risk is right. It's almost sure to be fatal (and an incredible painful way to die). Fortunately you can prevent it by feeding small amounts throughout the day instead of a large amount all at once. 

You'll also want to invest in training with a large dog. They can be dangerous, even if they don't mean to be. And those are two breeds that are stubborn and not particularly easy to train. With a little bit of work, and a lot of daily exercise, you'll have a beautiful gentle giant.

 |-| 
|-| co0mxhf || 16 || Gorgeous dog. If you haven't already, do a little research on Danes and mastiffs as both breeds have some specific medical issues to be on the look out for. But seriously, dang that's a gorgeous dog. |-| 
|-| co0lcjo || 28 || When he gets bigger get him some car tires to maul. My Dane mastiff mix loves it.  |-| 
|-| co0lom3 || 9 || One of my friends has a Great Dane and he's so big that he has his own bedroom, complete with a bed &amp; mattress from Ikea.  |-| 
|-| co0nb1v || 11 || That dog's poo will literally be a hand full in no time. 

Prepare yourself,  OP. |-| 
|-| co0th13 || 8 || If you haven't already, sign up for pet health insurance. Any conditions that show up before you sign up will be considered 'pre-existing' and will not be covered. After having spent around 3 grand in vet bills on a very sick little rescue english bulldog mix, we finally got him health insurance and couldn't be happier with it. He just had rather expensive surgery for his elongated soft palate and our isurance covered 90%. I knew exactly what I was getting into when I got a bulldog, And I'm just happy he ended up with someone who was able to support him financially and get him through all his fucked up health issues. Congrats on your new addition!  |-| 
|-| co0lo5d || 8 || Those poops are going to be the size of birthday cakes! |-| 
|-| co0y42o || 6 || Don't get rid of him when he gets big please. |-|

|-| co0r8vc || 4 || I think you should name it, Holy Shit... Because that will be the first thing people say when it grows up. |-| 
|-| co0xbc3 || 4 || not a "toy" but almost the biggest dog you could possibly get |-| 
|-| co0jlj9 || 6 || Bonus: before long, you'll be able to ride him to work.  |-| 
|-| co0j2yu || 3 || Wait until it's slobbering all over the place and claiming food off of your counters. I wouldn't have been able to say no to it either. |-| 
|-| co0jyxq || 4 || what a beautiful dog |-| 
|-| co0p9ka || 3 || That is going to be one massive dog.  Not only tall like a dane, but huge like a mastiff.  Wow.  But yeah that's still a lap dog, don't worry about that. |-|

"Bloat develops suddenly, usually in a healthy, active dog. The dog may have just eaten a large meal, exercised vigorously before or after eating, or drank a large amount of water immediately after eating."

One more thing to be aware of. Good luck and have fun! |-| 
|-| co0uztp || 3 || Are you in trouble now? |-| 
|-| co0v244 || 3 || as a former great dane owner, let me just say that you will have some dinosaur size turds, but they sure are worth every little shit.  |-|

|-| co0ypii || 3 || He's cute, but I hope whoever told you to get a toy breed is okay with this. |-| 
|-| co0nkzw || 16 || Very cute dog. I hope you can handle it. I hope it gets enough exercise. I hope you know how to socialize it with people and other dogs. I hope you know that choosing a dog based on its looks is a terrible idea.  |-|

He was at the local park with his Great Dane, which he has been going to for years. He went to go pet the Mastiff, as they have been very friendly towards each other for quite some time. 

Anyways, he went to go pet him or her, as usual, and the fucking thing just went off... Doctors said they stopped counting the stitches after the 70th...Good luck with yours!  |-|

He was visibly relieved, I think it was pulling and irritating his skin. He's so fuzzy you can't even see the spot I cut it out of. When he licks his mane, he throws his head backward so that he can get all the way to the end of the fur. It is hilarious and adorable.  He's also easily the most talkative cat I have ever met.

|-| co0g3l9 || 27 || These are the six (one is hiding in the back) puppies that my Blue Heelers, Jade and Paco, had last spring. 

We ended up keeping the puppy on the far right--she was first born, the runt, and she almost didn't make it due to complications. But now she's my little Olive!  |-| 
|-| co0ys7b || 14 || Okay, since there has been a storm of hate against my post, I feel the need to post one more thing, even though I feel like this thread is going to be dead soon...

Someone here posted that they were genuinely curious about where I could've adopted a dog that wasn't already fixed, and that made me think, because I'm pretty sure I've never heard of a shelter that allows a dog to leave without having been spayed/neutered. So I called up my mom and it turns out that the two that bred actually were purchased on two separate occasions. I guessed since they were purchased so long ago, I didn't really remember that they were not adopted like most of our other dogs that we've had throughout my life. I was also around 13 when Jade came in, so my preteen mind really didn't care about where this cute little chubby ball of love came from.

So even though we weren't allowing two shelter dogs to breed, you all are right that it was wrong of us to breed more dogs and take up homes that may have been filled by those who already don't have one. It became a thing of procrastination in getting our dogs fixed--NOT an excuse, obviously. 

My family realized the mistake and I believe we did the absolute best thing for these puppies. We get pictures from the owners very often, and they're living the life. Blue Heeler's, amongst all other dogs, deserve to be loved (and maybe spoiled) in great homes. 

I was hoping to just show some cute little fur balls since I came across this picture from a year ago, but it has raised an issue that I hope others will learn from.  |-|

Rosie would get jealous of Rascal because he could sit on my Pap's lap and she was too big. But my pap would let her up too. My pap ended up needing surgery for poor circulation due to this 100lbs dog sitting on his left leg. Thanks you so much for bringing back that memory for me. |-|

|-| co0o52b || 30 || Your dog is getting brown spots. I think that means it's ripe.  |-|

|-| co0p7zf || 11 || OP, what has your vet said about that skin? I know some coats just stay very thin no matter what one does, and that some breeds are more prone to it than others, so that's not all I'm going off of -- but is the pup's very red skin an effect of the photo or is that its usual state? It looks to me like the dog may have allergies or another reason for sensitive skin, and if you haven't already seen a vet about pursuing methods to manage that, I urge you to do so. Irritated skin can result in hotspots from frequent licking very easily (I'm a little concerned about that red spot on the pup's belly), and the condition of skin like that is generally pretty uncomfortable. Along with looking into ruling out allergies, there are a lot of ways to help supplement fats and other nutrients which can help soothe the skin and probably help thicken the coat as well, which will make the pup feel much better.

Edit to note for anyone reading who might be concerned about similar issues: Keep in mind that hotspots tend to become a self-perpetuating cycle, because the irritated skin bothers the dog increasingly more, and even when old hotspot sites heal, the amount of scar tissue that heals there can continue to be itchy and make the dog start all over with obsessing over the area. I helped with a dog at my old job who had gotten into a bad loop of licking hotspots into her right foreleg, to the point where she regularly chewed the leg up and spent the better part of two years with it completely bandaged up with duct tape to keep her from damaging it. (The final solution -- window screen! Taped safely/properly at the bottom and top. She didn't like licking it, it could be bittersprayed, and it let the spot heal more completely than anything else had. Great bandaging trick for that situation.) The moral of the story -- don't let stuff get worse! Resolve discomfort issues before they become chronic problems. |-|

So we bought a changeable sign with all sorts of messed up messages on them. It was always funny to see how people reacted. It also was funny being 12 and holding up the "what's your number" sign to hot girls. I would always scrabble to write it down when girls thought it was funny and signed their number. It actaully happen often but this was before cell phones and it's actually really hard to get a number threw sign motions.

Now that I am older I imagine those girls had boyfriends and they told them a little boy might call the house asking for a hot blonde. So that why I would hung up if a guy answered.

&gt;Today we've succeeded brothers. After countless posts calling women attention hoars and complaining something only made the front page because of the attractive woman in the picture. After posting the how genders take selfies meme hundreds of thousands of times, we have finally come to reap the benefits.

&gt;Today is a bright day m'brethren. No longer shall we be plagued by attractive women and their pets. No longer will us males be tricked into up-voting a post because we can't control our boners. Today is a glorious day. Rise up, all ye nice guys, all ye unattractive men who never get the same attention posting a picture with your pet. 

&gt;After all our hard work, we've finally become the master race of internet communities. We've learned from the errors of the Islamic community, and embraced our indulgence into admiring the feeeeemale form. Women! You shall hide your faces when posting images of yourself where someone might be forcefully tricked into click an arrow to give you insignificant points. Us master race men know where to find porn and women in positions we want them in, we know where we can admire pictures of famous women posted by other men that we can shamelessly vote on without feeling hopeless knowing that there was a real live woman behind the screen.  No longer shall your faces remind us of our loneliness. You hiding your face allows us to hide the misery and desolation in our hearts. EPIC WIN |-|

We wanted to bring him in, but he would have nothing of it. So we built a house for him, put in a heating pad for the winter and there he lived. We fed him everyday and was very happy there. 

He loved to be petted and looked just like this. He would never tire of being petted. His eyes would roll back into his head and he'd purr so hard he would drool.

He would always hang around outside her house seeking attention, whenever I dropped her off at home he'd run up and meow until he was recognized. After some time we realized that he's an outdoors cat(would always catch mice at 2am) and doesn't seem to have an owner, or at least not anyone who cares for him. So eventually she ended up taking him in, took him to the vet and all. He still hates being indoors but is slowly getting used to it.  |-|

|-| cobgjwm || 41 || Saw a thing about if dogs can tell time. They showed a dog who's owner kept the same schedule every day...and the dog would get up and be watching/waiting for him when it was almost time for him to get home. They did different tests and it seems like they know from your scent degrading over time. They know when it gets to a certain level that it is close to the time you usually come home.

My dog is old, so it could be why, but he is stone cold asleep in the recliner every day when I get home.

|-| cobl6e1 || 16 || Sorry to go off topic, but judging by the amount of ice there, you might have a problem with ice damming. It happens when the insulation is inadequate and heat from inside of your house melts the snow on the roof. The melted snow refreezes when the sun sets. Eventually you build up a pretty massive block of ice that can damage the roof. |-|

There are hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of pets put to death every year. 

I know they're cool but pure pet breeds are generally a terrible thing. They're less healthy, cost a ton, and keep perfectly good pets from being adopted.

Here's a thing about dogs which bares some insight into cat breeding as well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCv10_WvGxo |-| 
|-| cobho5l || 4 || I hate to be the bearer of bad news.  But a bengal cat is a a hybrid between a wild cat and domestic cat.  I know a breeder who stated that breeding bengals is hard because 1/3 of the kittens die.  That is because domestic and wild cats are not meant to procreate.  Please read this page, as it has all the problems from this breed:

|-| cob4e94 || 58 || Anytime a picture of a Chow gets posted, you have people commenting saying that they're mean dogs and you have people commenting that they're not mean dogs, it's all in how you raise them and train them.

Socialization and training are essential for all dogs, but can definitely be helpful in making dogs that tend to me less social more friendly and outgoing with strangers. That said, Chows are an asian breed. They're naturally suspicious of strangers. They guard and bark. They have a high bite rate incidence compared to other breeds. 

They're not bad dogs at all. But they won't have the personality of a lab. They just won't. And, being someone that works with dogs, I am cautious around Chows. They're not bad dogs but they're not "easy" dogs either. |-| 
|-| cob54d8 || 38 || I miss my chow chow Magnum. It was my dad's wedding present and ended up becoming my dog as I grew up.
Unfortunately he was killed by a man trying to steal him from my back yard. This particular guy came around before and tried to steal him by picking him up and over the back fence. Too bad he didn't know that Magnum was 100lbs of pure muscle and didn't like strangers in his yard. Magnum almost took the guys hand off before  he managed to get loose from his grip.
A few weeks later the guy came back while we were away and shot him to death in the backyard. I'll never forget seeing my dad cry so much over his body. It wasn't a clean one shot kill; the guy emptied 8 rounds into him and Magnum fought to the last, but ended up dying alone under the porch. I think thats why my dad cried so much; his favorite dog gunned down with no one to spend his last moments with. My dad gathered him up and buried him in the country under an elm tree. |-|

|-| cob76u0 || 4 || after reading this post a ways and owning two chows for 14 years, a person has to understand chows are pretty much one family dogs. They are not social dogs who want to meet other people, they want to stay near their "family" or pack. 

They can be very loving dogs, ours were some of the most affectionate dogs we've owned, but only to us. They kept a distance from strangers and guarded their backyard very strongly. 

They aren't goldens or labs who for the most part love everybody. Chows love, but they only love their family. 

For the most part they defend their territory strongly, but away from home, very docile. The problem is they are really cute and people want to touch them all the time. You have to be very aware of whom is around your dogs in public, which actually is a good idea with any breed.  

The chows would allow pets from strangers, but I had to tell them to accept them. Otherwise, they'd attempt to bolt away.  |-|

|-| cobnoby || 431 || I just woke up from a nap after work. Was heading out the door to help bring some groceries inside... and there she was, sitting on the porch staring at me like, "Wtf, let me in idiot." I popped a can of food and she trotted inside and practically inhaled all the food I threw at her. She doesnt look like shes hurt or limping or anything. Shes a litle dirty, and shes very skinny.... but plopped right down on the floor when I took the brush out. I've offically shed more tears now for this cat than I did for that girl that used to live here not too long ago. I better go back to bed before any more crazy shit happens around here.

Edit: Obligatory "Holy shit my first gold!". But seriously, thank you so very much. My holidays this year were very hard on me. My girlfriend left me the week before Christmas because she was cheating on me with a "friend" of mine. The day after that, me and my old man had gotten into some scotch to try and drink away our sorrows. When he's drunk, he likes to wander aimlessly outside and feel the cold air. I didnt notice until later that the door to our apartment was cracked open, and that she had gotten out. She has never been outside of our apartment here, so when she didnt come back, I had pretty much given up hope until tonight. I had an interview today for a promotion at work, and the one woman in my life that actually loves me came home tonight... so my new year is already starting to look up. Thank you again stranger.  |-| 
|-| cobmvo8 || 81 || Dear Diary, 

I just got back from my trip to Cabo. After a long year of naps, playtime, and a couple of visits to that dreadful place they call 'the vet', I decided to treat myself to a vacation. Because I'm a cat though, my short term memory restarted itself the second I got to the hotel and I forgot why I was there. I immediately freaked out and ran into the nearest alleyway where I spent fifteen minutes shredding a newspaper on the ground. I'm not sure why, it just felt like the right thing to do.

So began my long journey home. Have you ever seen the movie Homeward Bound? No matter, it was nothing like that. Sure some people thought I was cute and tried to rub my tummy while I slept, to which I promptly woke up and bit the shit out of them. 

By the time I made it back home some time had passed. The tree I wanted so badly to eat mysteriously vanished from my living space! The bearded one who spends a lot of time in front of that box picked me up, hugged me, and kissed me which I pretended not to enjoy. After the fuss was over, I found a spot to take a nap in, and promptly fell asleep.

Meow,

I hope you read this if your even THINKING of keeping it. I had a raccoon as a pet as when I was a small child (5-8 yrs old or so). This is an exercise in memory retrieval as well as sharing a story.
The mother raccoon had been hit by a car in front of our house and my dad rescued the kits from a hole in a tree in our front yard. He turned most of them over to animal control but we kept the most docile one (the runt) as a pet to try to save him (he wasn't doing well at first and dad thought animal control would just put him down since he couldn't eat unassisted).. We had to improvise a baby bottle for him from an eyedropper at first. Later we used the turkey baster with the eyedropper squeezie on the end with a slit in it as a nipple.. We kept him for a year and a half or 2 years till he grew up.

Eventually he lived in a towel nest we made in a cardboard box in the furnace room. and would come out to socialize with the with his family in the living room just like a cat or dog. As he got older he became more nocturnal and would come out in the evenings more and sleep in the day. He loved to torment us when we were trying to sleep. He would come wake us up by bouncing on our beds and pouncing on us in the middle of the night. We would raid the kitchen together and creep around the house trying not to wake up our parents. He watched cartoons with us. He used to steal things and hide them in his box. He had a fetish for stealing combs and hair thingies from my mom. Sometimes he stole my hotwheels.

I only remember a little of that time. His name was Coonie (original, i know) and I used to play with him like our neighbor kids would play with their cats. He was well equipped to defend himself when presented with 2 roughhouse boys like my brother and I, and we got nipped a few times. That just came with the territory like cats and scratches...no big deal. He liked to play with very much. He followed us around, pouncing and running away, lots of sneaking up on us etc. The crazy antics that us kids and he got up to still makes me smile to this day (40 years later). Note: Startled raccoons are dangerous but hilarious. It is hard to out-sneak a raccoon but it is possible.

Notes for you if you decide to keep him: CHECK THE LOCAL LAWS AND STATUES TO SEE IF IT IS LEGAL TO HAVE A RACOON!!! IT MUST HAVE A RABIES VACCINATION !!!!! YOU MAY HAVE TROUBLE FINDING A VET TO DO IT.. we found a farm vet that was willing, likely a regular pet vet would not. They like peanut butter, strawberries and popsicles. Also watermelon. Yes they do like to wash their food before they eat it. They will need an extra bowl of water for that and they make a bit of a mess. Funny to watch though. He eventually started to turn into an adult, became more and more aloof to human attention and began to run away for longer and longer periods of time, eventually up to two weeks. The last time he returned he was very affectionate and my dad pointed out how big and fat and sleek he was looking. He stayed that night and left again and never returned. when I see raccoons in my area I always wonder if they might be Coonies great-great grand kits or whatnot.

You cannot lock them indoors... do not try! The come and go as they please, they will eventually figure out how to work all the doors anyhow. (yes including the pantry and the refrigerator.) I repeat for emphasis!!! Do not lock, trap or otherwise cage him! they will go berserk and you have no idea how destructive a trapped raccoon can be. Have you ever seen a picture of a cabin or house after wolverines or bears had gotten into it? Yeah, like that.

They hate water guns, mom trained him to NOT do a lot of stuff with one. They had a Battle Royal once over dominance in the kitchen as he began to grow up. As I recall,...she broke out the wooden spoon for that one. Since she fed him usually, he got over the trouncing quickly and he never crossed her again. You didn't want to mess with mom and her wooden spoon ninja skills. He learned by the same rules as us boys did hah! They do not understand thrown objects like a dog. They will not play fetch. Rolling a ball across the floor is something they do like to pounce on.

I don't tell this story much because most people just nod slowly and back away when I do. I wish they had video back then. |-|

He kept crying and made these little squeaking noises on the way there ;( omg just thinking about it makes me so sad anyway the vet said there is nothing they can do for him and will put him down humanely.

They will be ready to eat adult food from the moment go, which they would be ready for too. They will still need momma's milk for about three weeks, but will survive without if left orphaned.

They are so cute it hurts even if you are not a GP person.

The moment momma gives birth she can fall pregnant again.
(Otherwise, daddy is quite welcome too)

A fact that I only read about: when giving birth, momma bends over, locks her teeth with the baby's and pulls the baby out.

There's actually entire rescues dedicated to small animals if you'd like one as a pet. Plenty of children tire of the poor things and flood the rescues. Keep your piggies healthy and they can live 5-7 years! Here's some good information for anyone interested:

|-| cog05x2 || 378 || I feel that now is as good a time as any to clear up a few minor points for those of you just joining us. First and foremost, my little feline friend is not a stray, he has a home that I see him going in and out of frequently throughout the day. He is in good shape, well fed, and clean, so I do not feel that this cat needs my help, he just wants a little affection and a place to nap :). Even if none of this were the case, my current living situation makes it impossible for me to personally keep him. Sad, I know, but that's just how it is.
I do not work for Verizon, I just own a hat that says so. I work for a traffic control subcontractor that handles work zone set up for our clients. I am currently on a road closure with a paving crew, and am scheduled to remain on this job til the completion. The job itself is quite a boring assignment, but with this little guy, it's made it worth it :) I look forward to seeing more of my little buddy over the next several days. 
Thank you to everyone for all the upvotes and positive comments, and I know they're all for my little fur ball friend here, but it makes me happy to see so many people who enjoy the little things like I do. :)
P.S. - for anyone who's curious, I first met him while listening to the RT podcast last week, so I've taken to calling him Monty :).

|-| cogab88 || 4 || I always look forward to seeing more of your posts with this little dude. He's such an affectionate cutie. Thank you for sharing this with us. :) |-|

 |-| 
|-| cog78ds || 9 || There is a house cat in my neighborhood that looks very similar to your bud. It started off cute enough. I'd be walking down the street and he'd follow me meowing for about a block begging to be pet. Eventually he followed me home and started showing up at my door looking to come in and hang out. Knowing this cat has a home (has a collar), is in good shape, plus having a cat of my own, I didn't feed or pay him much attention. Still, this cat started showing up almost every day. Now if I don't pet him, he lays down in my path and attacks me if I ignore him. These ginger cats are the devil.  |-| 
|-| cog8fhp || 4 || I love these daily posts! |-| 
|-| coga7a9 || 3 || OP, you aren't in Florida are you?  The cat looks just like one of ours that goes inside and outside at will. |-|

|-| cogls6t || 3 || So does he have some weird heart braking condition because of the mix? |-| 
|-| cogled1 || 208 || I never thought this was much of an "awe" cat as he looks genuinely sad:( |-|

|-| cogp8gq || 18 || Cats don't belong in poke balls, there's a reason meowth chose to walk around instead. |-| 
|-| cogr3xe || 7 || Adorable but that can't be comfy! I had one of those BK pokeballs with the golden mew two in it and wasn't there a hard plastic protrusion in it to hold up the card? |-| 
|-| cogmgw5 || 5 || *Meowth |-| 
|-| cogoh3c || 31 || Every time I see this photo, I wonder if the person tried to close the ball with the cat in it.  I then imagine myself killing said person if they did. |-| 
|-| cogyxz1 || 4 || That's a sad kitty if I saw one. |-| 
|-| cogxfqb || 3 || "human,why do you do this?i may be a month old but even i know that you suck as mom!" ;( |-|

|-| coghysn || 3 || This is why I want a cat look at those eyes |-| 
|-| cogrtjp || 12 || ITT: People thinking a little kitten posses the mental capability to feel sad about being put in a pokéball.

It's a fucking baby kitten. It has absolutely no idea what is going on. It doesn't even have feelings other than sleepy and hungry.  |-|

|-| cogodhb || 5 || I picked up what I'm pretty sure is a snake or a scary looking worm when I was about 7 or so down by a localish creek.  It was about this size, and had a diamond striped back.  Threw it instantly, but I still don't know if it was a worm mimicking a snake, or a real snake of sorts.   |-|

Although you should let your friend know that they could actually get into some trouble if they post pictures of a client's dog without permission. The last clinic I worked at had a little release that the clients could sign if their pets boarded with us so that we could post pictures to the clinic's website and/or facebook. |-|

|-| cog4v84 || 6 || I will also always upvote a Westie. 

Westies are the very best dogs. They're easy to look but they have the energy, tenacity, mentality of German Shepherds. 

I remember when mine was that tiny with his one ear down the very same way. Even when he was that tiny he would figure out ways to be independent and a general pain in the ass. That dog keeps me young and on my toes. 

I love that dog and you will too. |-|
