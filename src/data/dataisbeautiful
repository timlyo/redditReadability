|-| cntvy4b || 17 || why does everything about inequality get upvoted on reddit? and yes, it is possible if you change the scales to something other than default illustrator. |-| 
|-| cntwbya || 7 || If you compare wealth across countries, then you are mainly talking about differences in economic growth.  Sure, there are some very wealthy individuals in poor countries (typically a dictator), but, by and large, everyone in third-world countries is poor because there is not much productive activity that can be done there. 

Free trade between wealthy countries and poor countries does a lot to increase productivity in poor countries.  Take China for example.  This is because, even if you don't have a very sophisticated economy, you do have cheap labor.  If you build a good port and have laws and political stability so foreign investors are willing to risk putting up shop in your country, then foreign firms can ship in parts and have workers assemble them in your country and ship them out again.  As industry develops, infrastructure develops as well  (and so do the institutions and supporting industries). Consequently, these countries become suitable for industries creating more advanced goods and services.  This is what happened to China.  China is no longer the best place for cheap labor; unskilled labor is too expensive there now (this is because higher-tech industries have now become established and they bid up the price of labor), so t-shirts are made in Vietnam where labor is still cheap.  And, in fact, labor is starting to get too expensive in Vietnam, so many firms are trying to find out how to make Africa work as a source of cheap labor, despite all of its issues.  

Many people complain about how trade has exacerbated income inequality in the United States.  And it's true; trade with countries like China has reduced demand for unskilled and semi-skilled labor in factories in the United states, eliminating many middle-income jobs in the United States.  But the net effect has been an enormous reduction in global inequality.  Unless you are provincially minded, this should cheer you up.  

TLDR; trade is good.  |-|

It really felt wrong to visualise another man's pooping history, I will go take a shower now.

Something like 1/3 of the world's population has negative/zero net worth. I, *personally* therefore have more net worth than they do. That would be even more impossible to visualize (about 50 times more impossible). 

An interesting point is that a bum on the street with no debt has more net worth than a doctor fresh out of college with $300,000 in student loans to pay off. 

Indeed, if that bum on the street has a quarter in his pocket, he has more net worth than the bottom 25% of the U.S. population *combined*!!!!!! OMG.  |-|

|-| cnu4kk3 || 9 || As others have seemed to mentioned, the decrease in defecation on Monday's and Tuesday's seems likely due to dietary reasons. 


Any particular changes in your diet on a typical weekend? Though anecdotal, I know personally I tend to go out to eat more on weekends, or consume unhealthier food, which generally has less fiber. 



Beginning of the work week stress? Altered caffeine consumption at beginning of week? Lot's of different directions to potentially explore.  |-|

This kind of visualization of a huge set of data gives great insight into a body's performance.

I could imagine being able to match this type of visualization against a 'food intake diary' for that same time period.  That would be crazy handy for a Crohnie to figure out definite trigger foods and such.

|-| cnuy7yx || 15 || Inspired by /u/taxidata’s nifty [NYC taxi pixel plot](http://chriswhong.com/open-data/my-first-data-art-nyc-taxi-defrag/) and /u/Vizual-Statistix’s [study of driver names](http://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/2sabdc/the_most_common_names_of_nyc_taxi_drivers_oc/) which showed Muhammad as the #1 first name. 

Since Islam instructs followers to pray 5x daily at specific times, I wondered if one could identify devout Muslim hacks solely from their trip data. For drivers that do pray regularly, there are surely difficulties finding a place to park, wash up and pray at the exact time, but in many cases banding near prayer times is quite clear.  I plotted a few examples.

Each image shows fares for one cabbie in 2013. Yellow=active fare (carrying passengers). A minute is 1 pixel wide; a day is 2 pixels tall. Blue stripes indicate the 5 daily prayer start times which vary with the sun’s position throughout the year.

* Taxi data: http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/
* Prayer times: http://www.islamicfinder.org/prayerDetail.php?city=New%20York&amp;state=NY&amp;country=usa&amp;lang=english
* Tools: Python / Python Imaging Library

edit: The vertical grid and labels are all local clock times. Mar 10 from 2-3AM when the clocks jump forward should be empty, but I didn't account for that, so 20 minute fares from 1:50AM to 3:10AM are incorrectly drawn as 1hr20min long.  Likewise there are actually two hours worth of data inside 1-2AM on Nov 3 when clocks jump back. Note that hour is very bright on the all-cab heatmap.

A few years ago I wrote [LifeSlice](http://wanderingstan.github.io/Lifeslice/), an open-source Mac app that takes a picture of me every hour. Since then it has expanded to also take a screenshot, and a ton of other metrics: keys and words typed, keyboard shortcuts, mouse clicks &amp; scrolls, etc. I hope to make some more visualisations with that data sometime.

|-| cnw0wgz || 3 || My friends and I like to go out to the local antique store and browse their records selection once every few weeks.  It's a fun little trip and you get to take home some of your favorite music. (if you can find it)  There's a lot of charm in browsing through a selection of records and laughing at some of the silly names or covers.  Sometimes I'll buy a record because the artwork looks really cool.  In terms of how Vinyl sounds... Well, that's up to speculation.  If you get a good press that was properly mixed in generally good shape, yea, it sounds pretty awesome.  (Not much different from a properly mixed CD tho)  But everyone hears things differently, so it's all up to the listener to decide.

I think, for me, vinyl isn't necessarily about "the best audio playback quality", but it's more about the experience of finding the albums you like, enjoying the artwork, building your audio system, and then listening to the fruits of your labour from start to finish with pops and clicks and all. |-|

* Tool: Excel

For the IQ Classification I used the [Current Wechsler IQ Classification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification) |-| 
|-| cnx6kfx || -15 || If you take this false trial as a realistic source, you gonna have a bad time :) |-| 
|-| cnx6lm6 || 9 || This somewhat creeps me out, granted I don't know much about IQ and it's relation with other things like morals or psychopath tendencies etc etc. It's kind of eerie to think that these men would have been smart enough to know full well what they were doing, hell they could probably even see through the propaganda and everything but still went ahead with what they were doing. |-| 
|-| cnx6moj || 9 || Its interesting to see the brilliant minds behind the Nazi party |-| 
|-| cnx6u60 || 37 || So basically Nazi leaders were superior or very superior? PHRASING |-| 
|-| cnx6utd || 18 || If it weren't for the whole NAZI thing, Walther Funk would have a pretty cool name. |-| 
|-| cnx6xgq || -4 || I am kinda tired of all this visualization without interpretation... so the conclusion is "yes"? |-| 
|-| cnx73il || 9 || Neat. I didn't realize this data set existed.

I suppose you'd have to be pretty above-average to work your way to the top management of one of the most powerful countries in the world, regardless of what kind of ridiculous philosophy its leaders held.

It might be nice to show their poisitions (e.g. Seyss-Inquart, Reichskommissar of the Netherlands; Dönitz, Grand Admiral). Although that's complicated for some of them (Schacht, economics minister but removed before war because he opposed rearmament, imprisoned in concentration camps for suspicion of involvement in Hitler assassination attempt; Hess, Deputy Führer until he was arrested by the Allies during a secret attempt at a peace treaty). |-| 
|-| cnx7aux || 15 || Would be interesting to see the same study for Palo Alto vs East Palo Alto, CA just separated by the 101.  |-| 
|-| cnx7bag || 692 || In the context of LA, this is kind of misleading. Neither of the areas highlighted are really all that crime heavy to begin with, at least not compared to more inner city areas. The crime rate is probably 10x higher in areas around downtown and to the south of it (the areas in orange/red). That's where most of the people are, and that's where the hard neighborhoods are.

Also, that big gray area to the west of the highlighted stretch of the 405 is the Van Nuys Airport and several golf courses. There isn't high reported crime there because there aren't that many people there most of the time. On the east side, it's all residential. This isn't really that surprising. |-| 
|-| cnx7fuu || 20 || So obviously all they have to do is move the highway a couple miles over. |-| 
|-| cnx7hkp || 4 || "Art for art's sake." |-| 
|-| cnx7krz || 9 || Richer people live closer to the beaches/coast so you would expect more crime the further inland you go.  |-| 
|-| cnx7loj || 22 || You have to include the *south*east part of LA to make this work. As shown in the first image, from the South Bay on up, crime is roughly the same on both sides of the 405.

Nice application of [Betteridge's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines) though. |-| 
|-| cnx7wy3 || 5 || I have family that lives in North Hills split by the 405. The area they live in is an extension of northridge go past the freeway and its a ghetto. I always tell people when they are looking for houses in the valley as long as you are on the right side of the 405 you should be good.  |-| 
|-| cnx7yt0 || 5 || I live east of the 405. The freeway separates me from the douchebags in Manhattan Beach, thank God.  |-| 
|-| cnx88m6 || 88 || I like how in some places, a highway is "the" highway, as in, "the 405" vs. "405" or "highway 405."  I grew up near Rochester, NY, and all the local highways are "90 (or the thruway)," "390," "490," and "590," but when I moved to Buffalo for 6 months to do an internship, I was surprised to learn that everyone there referred to the local highways as "the 190," "the 290," "the 33," and "the 198."  So when you'd give directions in Rochester, they'd say "take 390 north to 590 north, and get off at the Monroe ave. exit," but if I was in Buffalo (just an hour west on the Thruway), they'd say "take the Thruway to the 290, and then get on the 190 to the 33, and get off at the Grant St. exit."  |-| 
|-| cnx8h0b || 5 || I thought Joseph Goebbels had crazy high IQ. He might not be considered a "leader" though.  |-| 
|-| cnx8h1p || 6 || I wonder where Hitler would be in all of this.  Or even Goebbels.  Those are the only two Nazi leaders I remember. |-| 
|-| cnx8lop || 53 || West of 405 is the fucking ocean. And neither of these areas have serious crime issues relative to downtown LA . |-| 
|-| cnx8mam || 4 || This is a cool question and visualization. I think encoding crime as both color and height is an odd choice, though. This plot should probably be 2d. |-| 
|-| cnx8mg1 || 5 || I live right on the good side of that map. intersection of nordhoff and 405. man, on one side are nice and groomed middle class family homes, right on the other side are apartments that house some of the most drug and violence infested populous in all of the valley. they've even installed permanent cones on the east side of the freeway in order to stop drug peddlers from using the corners... you hear of shootings and fan related violence once and a while. (I'm sure there is more but I don't hear about it). also, on the good side of the freeway there are tons of car break ins and theft... |-| 
|-| cnx8rjk || 4 || So many questions:

* What's your favorite tool to make data visualizations?
* Do you get a dataset and then make a dataviz or do you have a concept in mind and then find the data around that concept?
* How much time do you spend on creating a dataviz?
* How do fellow journalist look at DDJ, is it respected or frowned upon?
* Where do you go to find good data?

Looking forward to hear your opinions, love the data visualizations you guys make! |-|

|-| cnx8zmj || 7 || I spent the good part of yesterday downloading American Community Survey files into excel, creating pivot tables, and making calculations to determine unemployment rates by college major.

|-| cnx9d1i || 4 || What is the proper capitalization of JAVASCRIPT? |-| 
|-| cnx9j1k || 3 || * Can you describe your typical workflow from the conception of a story up until the time it is published?
* It is my impression that most data journalists start from a journalistic background and augment their skills with programming. How do you think the reverse path compares - starting from an engineering background and moving towards journalism? Do the two paths occupy separate niches? 

Thank you |-| 
|-| cnx9jeh || 3 || What do you think are good tools for people to make effective data visualizations outside of traditional academic tools (e.g. Excel, KaleidaGraph, etc)?

What are your favorite types of visualizations to make?

|-| cnxaftx || 3 || Do you think this kind of data journalism will continue to grow at the level of smaller publications?  It seems like it's exploded in national level publications but hasn't gotten much traction at the local level (I assume because of a combination of cost and unwillingness to change). |-| 
|-| cnxamr7 || 6 || Stupid parochial data.  The east side of the 405 also happens to have higher population density with more commercial zoning.  And we're not talking about splitting the city, just 2 miles east and west of a narrow stretch of the 405.  Again, really stupid data. |-| 
|-| cnxawb7 || 4 || Is there a time and place for pie charts? |-| 
|-| cnxb3g4 || 3 || How much of a visualization should be designed to tell a story compared to letting the viewer explore the dataset? |-| 
|-| cnxbxbg || 3 || I really love data-driven, visual journalism, but I didn't get any kind of practical experience working with it in my journalism classes (though I do have experience with Excel and SPSS) -- where should I start the self-teaching process to become a good data journalist, particularly with visual stories? |-| 
|-| cnxbxwb || 3 || being a resident of LA, I'd say the 110 freeway seems to be more of the divider than the 405. cops don't ask you what the hell you're doing there when east of the 405, but east of the 110, they ask you what the hell you're doing there. |-| 
|-| cnxbzii || 3 || How do you prototype your visualizations? Do you go directly to d3 with an idea of where you want to go or do you sketch out or use other software to prototype first?

What kinds of teams do your organizations have set up to support you? Are you in charge of data collection, analysis, and design? Or do you have other teams around you to aid in any of these steps? |-| 
|-| cnxcicz || 6 || What's your dream dataset? |-| 
|-| cnxcowb || 7 || There were [many pieces](http://www.forbes.com/sites/trevorbutterworth/2014/10/02/when-data-journalism-goes-wrong/) and [tweets](https://twitter.com/albertocairo/status/516260495964532736) written last year bemoaning the poor methodology 
used by data journalism sites. Is it possible that the speed at which online data journalists are required to publish at is negatively affecting the quality of the analysis and data visualizations being published? Because it seems that your sites often go for things that could go "viral," but are based on sketchy data or sloppy methodology. 
 |-| 
|-| cnxdbn1 || 16 || I think it's more likely that people stuck in the horrendous northbound commute have a higher tendency to pull off of the freeway in a rage and immediately stab, shoot, and rob whoever is around. |-|

|-| cnxfzc0 || 14 || Study says its analyzing Los Angeles City, yet it only studies the valley, A completely different demographic that is only one part of Los Angeles and does not represent the whole. He choose the valley part of the 405 which is a terrible place to divide the city (there is no divide and as others have stated there is a Dam, golf courses, and just less population in general to the west side of the 405 when you are in the Valley). The freeways in Los Angeles are not like train tracks. If you really want to find a divide look altitude. All the rich people in Los Angeles live in higher altitudes and all the poor people in lower ones. |-| 
|-| cnxg205 || 4 || Calling Schacht a Nazi leader is a bit dubious, he was acquitted at Nuremberg. He was an economist who worked in pre-Nazi Germany and continued to try and help the economy one Hitler's band of merry murderers took over. In fact I believe he tried to prevent re-armament because it would unbalance the economy

Also its interesting that the lowest IQ is from Streicher, the propagandist who's job was to make people obey and hate rather than critically assess  |-| 
|-| cnxhlsf || -3 || Shows you how irrelevant IQ is to success. These geniuses thought they could win a war against entire world. |-|

Then the world's your oyster! |-| 
|-| cnxli2n || 4 || This is a classic case of accurate data but bad analysis.

First, the area under analysis is the San Fernando Valley.  This largely residential suburban sprawl from 50 years ago.  The further north you go, the farther you are away from the heart of the city.

Second, as someone already stated, the West side along this stretch has some golf courses, some parks, a huge airport and lot's of industrial/warehouse space....not high crime areas.  As you go north, the East side is traditionally been poorer, ethnic neighborhoods that are just statistically more likely to have higher crime.  I don't think this has any relation to the freeway.

The area that should have been analyzed is further south, where the 405 divides the beach cities from South-Central Los Angeles. |-| 
|-| cnxlqhu || 3 || I'm not sure how the author can have such a good grasp of statistics and making graphs without also being aware of the most important rule: correlation does not imply causation... The only thing proven is that there are different crime rates on either side of the free, this doesn't mean the freeway is the cause or offer any other explanation of why this is happening. |-| 
|-| cnxogc9 || -4 || The only thing an IQ test can accurately determine is how well one does on IQ tests. 

Modern IQ tests are nonsense. IQ tests from the '40s? Super nonsense. |-|

|-| cnxto09 || 4 || San Fernando Valley resident here.  Interesting thing about LA, the eastern parts of the city were populated first and then grew west (which seems odd since the ocean is to the west, but I digress).  So even in the Valley, where the test area was, the eastern neighborhoods are older.  With a few exceptions (studio city, valley village, etc.), these neighborhoods in the eastern valley are where white flight first took hold.  The white population continued to move west and north as darker skinned folk moved to the area.  Many of those neighborhoods east of the 405 are now predominantly latino, many of the residents being recent immigrants from central america (i'm thinking pacoima, arleta, panorama city, etc.).  These poorer demographics also bring higher crime stats with them.  The 405 in this case is just an arbitrary line that just happens to split the Valley in half and I'm certain has no direct correlation to crime levels.  You can see the west Valley is not immune to crime either.  the north/south line of red is Reseda Blvd and the east/west red line is Sherman Way.  Neighborhoods along these corridors such as Reseda, Winnetka and Canoga Park are not area I'd recommend anyone to live in unless they had to. |-| 
|-| cnxwhim || 3 || What is the reason for focusing on this freeway, and ignoring the region in the southeast of the map with a much higher crime rate?

Also, is geographic density the appropriate metric to use when displaying crimes on a map? Why not crimes per 1000 people? Using a map show us the spatial distribution.  

What exactly is the 2-D view showing? From what I can tell its actually an end view of the freeway which would make it a 1-d view (i.e. crime density as a function of distance from the freeway).

|-| cobwqit || 18 || Most people actually don't meet the RDA values for some minerals. Couple that with the knowledge that RDA values aren't super meaningful and that we actually don't know optimal micronutrient intake that will net the highest quality of life means that making a statement like "people are getting enough vitamins from their diet" a silly claim. Maybe that they get enough vitamins to avoid acute deficiencies but nobody atm can claim that they get enough to minimize the risk of a cancer death or some other ailment.   |-| 
|-| cobvnhr || 23 || That title doesn't even represent the article.  

Folic acid deficiency *causes* spina bifida.

Vitamin D deficiency *causes* rickets.

Vitamin C deficiency *causes* scurvy.

That's the science..that if you don't get enough of those vitamins in your diet, you will get those side effects.  A good healthy diet where you KNOW you are getting enough vitamins is preferable, of course.

You just need to trust the manufacturer of the supplements you get.  BUT *of course* they aren't going to do any good if there is no vitamin anything in the pill at all. |-|

Secondly, this is too vague to be interesting.  Dietary supplements includes everything from the whole range of vitamins to minerals, herbs, and supplemental oils.  In specific circumstances some supplements can be extremely beneficial, with Vitamin D being a particularly good example

So why is this here?  It isn't beautiful or even aesthetically rich.  It isn't really data.  The problem is that this subreddit has degenerated into "numbers that give me an emotional reaction" which makes it pretty much useless.  Go back to r/politics or some other sewer with this crap. |-|

If anything, we are over anylyzing it, and mainly due to the fact that medicine is big business that is only concerned with profit margins as opposed to actually helping people. We, as Americans, are forced to take health care into our own hands because no one in the health care industry can be trusted because all they care about is getting your money.

|-| coawvlg || 3 || My personal tactical interpretation. The 4-4-2 is substituted by the 4-1-4-1 and afterwards by the 4-2-3-1, and that's a sort of evolutionary sequence:
The 4-4-2 system was the standard model in the 90s, and made of 4 defenders, 4 midfielders in a line and 2 strikers. In the 4-4-1-1 one of the forwards moves back and acts between the midfield line and the striker. The 4-2-3-1 is an additional evolution of the system, with the two wingers moving forward and acting on the line of the second striker, while the two central midfielders move a step back have mainly defensive and playmaking duties.
