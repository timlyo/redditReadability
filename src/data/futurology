|-| cntt4ng || 4 || I think it's interesting.  In a world of constant specialization in an educational community that's always looking for new things to study, it just makes sense.  I worry that it might be hard to analyze something that hasn't happened yet, but I think it would be interesting to consistently ask students to predict the future and then study the accurate predictions when they happen.  Also, looking at previous futurologist predictions from the past and studying why they thought different things were going to happen.

|-| cntwilu || 219 || Dystopian conspiracy time! Imagine if lethally autonomous robots were the monopoly of defense contractors and the super-rich, we lived on a planet with dwindling resources, entire populations of people were made obsolete by robotic labor. Due to centralized systems of agriculture, the food industry is controlled by a handful of individuals, net neutrality fails and the majority our media is further consolidated from four companies to one. That would be CRAZY wouldn't it!? I wonder what THAT world would look like. You know, where rich people don't really need the rest of us and we are all begging them to give us a basic income. Oh, oh, and don't forget those people who keep coming on this subreddit talking about potential doom and gloom, but keep getting pushed out and called a Luddite. "Shut up, I don't like your future, it forces me to consider basic income in a different way and that makes me feel like you are calling me a techno hippy"

EDIT// Proving my point guys. Looks like I'm rolling into the negatives. Futurology does not consider the socio-economic realities of this time, and they prefer to live in their  bubble of utopia. It's incredible to me that this reddit has so much excitement for the future but refuses to acknowledge the current realities that threaten it in a mature and deliberate fashion. Why nothing about radical decentralization? Why does that discussion keep getting shut down?

EDIT2// Whoever gave me reddit gold thank you. I am currently homeless and staying in the back room of a friend's house. I work at a ski resort for $8.75 and hour despite my international college education in a state that has a minimum wage of 10$. (New Mexico) Why? Well that's because I'm a veteran who has a hard time keeping a job due to severe moral injury after I built a system for drones in Afghanistan that continues to kill people to this day in Pakistan. Obama's mission to end veteran homelessness seems a little inflated in terms of success, a fabrication of figures. (at least I think) They certainly don't care about you if you start badmouthing their policies in a public setting. So thank you, that made my day.  |-|

|-| cntzns0 || 9 || In my opinion western countries and America in particular should aim at healing the disparity within their own country but a lot of racist religious and cultural influences make this difficult as a lot of wealth is still held in older conservative generations. If the baby boomers weren't around things would be different politically, but also future technology is going to change politics greatly. I think the only thing the Republican Party has right is the warning of too big of government. And of course values are incompatible and relative, I generally think country politics should look very different to city politics. |-| 
|-| cntzryk || 4 || I have some doubts about this. They claim it generates enough power to not only power itself but produce extra power? That seems really unlikely. Or are they getting away with saying this because the boilers use gas and thus don't require electrical power?

Probably wouldn't be a smart idea in LA or San Francisco, but plenty of other places could benefit from this. Especially in developing nations. Now it would be possible to just ship a ton of concrete instead of separate building supplies or building them out of local, inferior materials.

And I'm sure in the developed world this would make an interesting type of home, once again with the modularity one would be able to piece together a house designed by themselves. Synthetic wall coverings could be used and you'd have a durable, decently insulated home. I wonder if wall coverings could be made from recycled plastic, so we can reduce the amount that gets dis cared every year. |-|

|-| cnu1t8y || 5 || Wealth isn't an issue, but the accumulation of wealth through non participatory means (like interest) does nothing for the economy as a whole.  

Interest, as a simple example, is just wealth for wealth's sake.  If I was foolish enough to put $100M in a savings account at 1%... that 1% never funds a company, never pays the employees their salaries, never buys things that workers make, and in general represents a $100M loss to the free flowing capital in any economy.  There are an incredible number of non-participatory kinds of investment vehicles like that which the very wealthy can take advantage of and they don't do anyone any good except the wealthy individual who can skim that income without ever bringing it back into businesses and individuals.  There are only so many cars, houses, food, and luxuries that one person, or one family can consume or use.  You can argue that the $100M becomes working capital for a financial institution to lend money to business endeavors and people, but that only works up to a certain point. |-| 
|-| cnu1x2c || 7 || I love the idea of 3d printed houses/buildings. Eventually once the process has been "perfected" we might end up with house ideas/designs that not only challenge the extremes of the most skilled architects, but are more structurally sound and can also be replicated easily, and cheaply for everyone. No more suburbia where everyones house is identical for miles and miles. I like it. |-|

|-| cnu221a || 291 || 12 years ago, Apple created and manufactured all their products in Cupertino, California. Today, they manufacture ALL their products in China. To avoid federal taxes, they moved their corporate office to Dublin, Ireland. To avoid state taxes, to Reno, Nevada. Their profits? Parked in off-shore accounts.  


If this sounds like the "American" way of doing business or "Patriotic", then you are truly clueless. This has come about through corruption of our democratic system and plain old greed. The top 1% and majour corporations have access to Congress that you and I do not. This was not the way our system was intended to be run. It needs to change. |-|

It's just groups. These groups cared about what they wanted, so much so that they paid for it (bought some congressmen). America isn't United anymore. It's Divisible by the Kardashians and prime time viewing. Americans don't really care. Because if they did, the small group that is comprised of the wealthy wouldn't meant shit. If 99 percent of Americans actually cared and demanded things through the awesome democratic system we set up, the wealthy wouldn't have to share, but act in a different way. No one is always going to win 100 percent of the time, that's just not real. But right now it looks like a shut out with the wealthy taking all that they can get because hey, no one's really saying anything so I'm just going to take this cookie if no one wants it. Hello? Anyone? Okay? Taking this cookie now? Bye? |-|

Your $500 smartphone is more powerful than 17 million dollar supercomputer in 1980s.
Poor is a relative term. Elon Musk is poorer compared to Bill Gates, but unimaginably richer than me.

The problem is that when you compare yourself to someone richer than you, it makes you unhappy.
That's natural for humans. Because we are social animals.
But let's face it, envy is a good thing when it motivates you for reaching your goals, and it can also be destructive feeling.

What's wrong with wanting your son or daughter to not be ugly? You could even guarantee your child have a higher IQ. What is so bad about having an attractive intelligent child isn't going to have trouble with diseases throughout their life?

|-| cnu5ep0 || 11 || Correct me if I'm wrong but it isnt it more difficult to measure the richest 1% because their wealth is not just stacks of cash in a bank vault but rather percentages of companies or things they own. So they cant just use all that money without collapsing their company right? |-| 
|-| cnu5qxw || 3 || 1) We are at a point where GIANT corporations are the front-runner in nearly every industry

2) The corporations manufacture in other countries (china), set up their main offices in other countries, and put there profits either in off-shore bank accounts OR back into manufacturing to produce more goods (China.) 

3) This means the only real relation to america and the giant corporations is to sell and buy. The money made is RARELY cycled through back into America's monetary system. 

Now we have super rich corporations who retain that wealth and super poor Americans who bought those products because the corporations (in their best interests) are not paying Americans to produce, they are simply using them to consume. Solution? I guess legal matters, but that will not come for many years now...

|-| cnu6fds || 14 || This would be a big move on Google's part and certainly a tremendous impetus to SpaceX, even with Musk's current resources and force of will behind it.  Will they get a return on their investment? Maybe. Possibly. Hopefully.

However, Google just made an investment that probably will reap huge dividends. Namely, the almost half-billion they dropped on Magic Leap.  That is a technology that could very well reshape the way we interact with almost every type of technology that exists today, including rockets, cell phones, computers, ATMs, cars ... you name it.

The ability to shine a holographic-quality image directly onto the retina (as opposed to the way we use screens now by reflecting the light from a screen into the eye), means we are possibly on the cusp of things like actual holodecks, true 3-D in-space images and other almost sci-fi level technology. |-|

|-| cnu7crh || 16 || Americans especially are trading virtual wealth for more tangible forms of wealth.  We feel wealthy because we "own" or have access to millions of dollars of intellectual property, yet most of us cannot afford a house, are underemployed and cannot pay off our student loans.  If the internet were stripped from us for even a month, people would wake up a little and realize how much of they are lacking in even the most basic necessities, but as long as we are "drugged" on content we will passively accept this continuing shift in wealth. |-| 
|-| cnu7oh4 || 10 || Some people will be worried at the ever growing dominance of Google, but frankly I think it's a price worth paying &amp; I find the ever growing dominance of the surveillance state much more troubling.

Giving internet access to the 2/3 of the world that still doesn't have it, will be such a huge benefit to mankind, this can't happen fast enough.

Some people interested in futurology can get very caught up with possible dystopias &amp; you can forget to see the good news happening right in front of our eyes.

Although we in western countries are having a bad time economically at the moment, the world's poorest people are benefiting hugely in the 21st century from technology.

Africa the world poorest continent, is heading for 100% cellphone/smartphone penetration by 2019.  Solar power is getting cheaper &amp; cheaper &amp; hopefully if this works out they will have universal internet access.  I think this will be a revolution for them as comparable, if not greater than the industrial revolution in Europe &amp; America.  Except it will all happen for them much faster &amp; compressed into a much shorter time-frame.

Developments like this also think we may have a fighting chance of bringing the world's poorest people up to  decent standard of living without destroying our environment in the process too. |-|

|-| cnu8pte || 9 || I don't even know what my political beliefs make me; whether it's libertarian, democrat or what have you. All I know from the simple fact that the rich just get richer and do nothing in the process to help their fellow humans out makes me fill up with rage and disgust.

I honestly believe that no matter what the general populace does, nothing is going to change and the 99% are screwed either way we look at it.

By the way I've been curious about my first statement. Is there any way I can figure out what political party I do align with mostly? I know it's not [r/politics](reddit.com/r/politics) but I've always been curious since I dont really identify/agree with a majority of what any of them say. |-|

The fact that people don't have enough (not just money) to live healthy and happy lives is what concerns me. Rather than concentrating on how to squeeze money out of the super-rich minority why don't we focus on how we can improve things for those that need it. |-| 
|-| cnubycj || 8 || Governments just need to eliminate tax loopholes and more aggressively go after people who cheat the system, everyone should be held accountable for paying their fair share of taxes whether they be rich or poor.

I love the idea of someone who wants small government, looks at this wealth gap, and says "I can get there." Even though statistically you literally cannot. 

They all want the chance to live like kings. The selfish vanity in that sentiment is repugnant. You would seriously rather people live with almost nothing so you can have even the CHANCE to be a multibillionaire.  |-| 
|-| cnuh9sn || 3 || A report came out of Davos in the last day or two saying that 1% of the population will own 50% of the world's wealth by 2016.  Meaning 1% of people on earth will own as much as the all the rest of humanity on the planet.  This is a chilling statistic to me.  If people were good and cared about their fellow man and about the planet, it might not alarm me so much - but the reality is they do not.  People like Ray Kurzweil look at humanity as a blight, like locusts.  He is not using his wealth to help humanity - he is using his wealth to create his female, virtual identity called "Ramona" and revive his dead father.  He could give a flying fuck less about the rest of humanity.  The other 1% intend to use technology to rise above the hoards of all us locusts in the same way.   I don't see good things coming in the next 10-20 years for everyday people...  In my mind we are headed into an "Elysium" type society. |-| 
|-| cnuhsrj || 5 || Honestly its hard to imagine either of those occuring. The bastardisation of the capitalist and democratic systems we are seeing today (primarily in developed nations *cough USA*) paints a much starker future of scarcity and class division. 

Aside from a few outstanding citizens I think we are more or less fucked and thinking that the wealthy will actually dedicate time, money and energy to helping the common and poor is just a pipe dream. People are filthy greedy and selfish animals who really only care about themselves and their own. Sure there are people who actually break this mould but they are few and far between and rarely have the resources or means to instigate actual change. 

I want to believe in a post scarcity society or at the very least one where people don't starve to death because we care more about them than the Kardashians but the realist in me doesn't place much stock in it.

|-| cnuht7y || 3 || Something something "boot straps", something something "job creators", something something "complete". Yes, and yet whenever we try to have an adult conversation about wealth re-distribution, others who are opposed to this are quick to say, "We tried that once and it didn't last, so we shouldn't try it again."

Well of course it didn't last. Nothing lasts in a chaotic system. That's why wealth re-distribution needs to be a continuous process and not a one-time event like a Christening or a funeral. It needs to be part of the way our economy functions. But, of course, those opposed to the idea just say that because they don't want anyone to know the REAL reasons they oppose wealth re-distribution. I'm not sure what those reasons are because none of the ones I can imagine make any sense for someone who isn't, themselves, super wealthy would benefit even peripherally from. |-| 
|-| cnuj68m || 15 || Something that goes unnoticed is changing perceptions, opinions, and beliefs about the present, the future, and the trend in between. Ask someone 5 years ago what big news would be happening in 2015.

 Ask someone on the street in 2010 what they think of self-driving cars, and they would have called it fiction. Now all major car manufacturers are building fully autonomous cars by 2020, so many people know about it and are expecting it.  

 The important thing to note here is not the knowledge of what people think about their future. But the active process that goes on that actively shapes peoples perception. Observation and communication. The fact that we're so connected with society right now more than ever before is helping accelerate this shift that's occurring. 

 The more efficient the collective perception of their society changes, the faster it will develop and adapt to changing technology. We're going to see it change even quicker as we begin to realize our own perception changing, and it's going to get people talking. Exactly like we are now. The more people talking about it, the faster the change. It's a positive feedback loop. It will change peoples expectations. Change the expectations of the consumers, and the prosumers will adapt. Ray Kurzweils Law of Accelerating Returns at play here. |-|

The average American family is in the richest 1% of all people on this entire EARTH.  They are RICH to the rest.  But instead of taking any responsibility for anything or not taking for granted every little convenience we have we have to point fingers at the guy in the yacht because it's HIS fault that everyone is so "poor".  If we just took all of his money all the problems would be solved.


I am not sure where all the economists go when threads like this are trooped out but they sure seem to shrink back in their holes.

***Here's a scenario for you.***

John is the richest man in MegaCity, he has 4 Billion dollars in the bank.

The next 250 Richest guys make up another 4 Billion.

The average person in MegaCity makes 35k a year. The difference between John and his rich buddies and the average worker is obscene (which everyone agrees on).

There are 8 million people in MegaCity.

The new tax law of 85% goes into affect for John (and John and his rich buddies alone) and requires an immediate payment of assets based on that new tax.  MegaCity collects 6,800,000,000 and distributes it to each citizen equally (except John and his rich buddies)

Each citizen gets $850.00. - Life Changing isn't it?  Where's my yatch?...

You can feel free to scale up the amount of rich people and the amount they have in the bank to any amount you like, but remember you can't do it next year.

Next year tax season rolls around and John now has untaxable income because he decided that giving 85% was not worth ever working again.  There is no point, John retires on his 600 million and doesn't lose a thing, he still has the gigantic yatch, still has his jets and mansions. Now the rest of the rich guys no longer have the same investment capital and thus cannot generate the same amount of wealth to tax in addition to finding ways to not pay the tax or offset it, including but not limited to, moving out of the country, cutting jobs in their businesses and some, doing shady things to avoid the ridiculous new tax. 

In other words, making money has slowed down considerably which WILL have an immediate impact on the new "equality" based economy. So the next year the tax base goes DOWN considerably.  Not only is it a loss of this huge windfall from the previous year where all of the funds were distributed but now the economy doesn't generate as many billionaires to tax! Now there are less people out there generating wealth through real estate deals (taxes), businesses (taxes) and other job creation (taxes) But who cares right? Those rich bastards got what they deserve!

Congratulations MegaCity on your 850 per person and a few less obscenely rich people so we can all sleep better at night.  You reap what you sow.

*************************


**Now don't get me wrong**, I am all for raising taxes on the obscenely rich, and this is **a silly and stupid scenario** obviously we aren't going to do it like that and it isn't even something that would happen but I am using it because you all seem to think we need to take all the rich peoples money immediately to solve the disparity.   What kills me is that Obama's plan (that you all seem to be behind as a solution) will do absolutely NOTHING for you, you'll get a new tax credit which might offset the increasing health care costs and other taxes the government is levying on you almost daily. They will take 4% more from Capital gains, lower the threshold for inheritance tax and all it will do is slow down some investment, add slightly to the amount of spending the government does, which is already in the red and we'll end up lucky to break even.

Taxing rich people more will not SOLVE the problem, there simply isn't enough of them and this economy is ***fragile***. We need better solutions than "class warfare".

BTW... Guess what happens the day this plan above (or any real tax plan with teeth) goes into affect? The Stock Market will crash, billions if not trillions will be lost and all of that money lost... is a tax write off. It's such a joke. |-|

|-| cnumpwo || 4 || I think the constant "crying wolf" in this sub and other communities like it is just that everyone's scared of missing the moment when the canary in the coal mine keels over.  "Hey, what if this new research or tech that just came out will actually lead to the thing that will define the rest of this century or beyond?"  Will it be VR, Energy, AI, molecular manufacturing, or even some mathematical proof or disproof (like P vs. NP and Computational Complexity problems)?  Or will the more defining thing actually be climate change and environmental problems and complications?  Or maybe even the end of privacy and the tracking of everything everyone does is what will cause the most change and/or problems?

To me, it's obvious the big one is how AI will go, and what in the end will be possible and what will be impossible.  Without knowing the answer with certainty all other predictions about tech advancement and the rest are harder to see.  I know plenty of experts will say that they don't lose sleep over this, and that it will always be slow incremental process built piece by piece by people, and never really get out of hand.  That nothing seemingly "mystical" like whatever process produced us and our strange 'sense' of reality, qualia, etc. will happen.  It could be that what we learn in the end is that our own 'qualia' and sense of 'experiencing' things is completely false and there only because it is a quirk that improved survivability.

It could be that everything just continues on business as usual for most of this century, and the biggest news is medical advancements, maybe?

Basically I think all three of your listed groups are probably right to a lesser extent.  Just turn the knob down from 11 to about 3 or 4.  I don't expect to ever wake up one day, read the news, and think that "Well, now everything has completely changed, forever.  What now?"  I expect it all to be far more insidious and subtle if MASSIVE CHANGE happens at all. |-|

|-| cnuow94 || 43 || The wealthy aren't "job creators"

The market is what creates jobs and wealth, not the wealthy. A thousand millionaires creates more economic growth than one billionaire. Even if a billionaire buys a new car every day, it's far short of the thousand cars the millionaires would buy. Extrapolate that to food, clothing, economics entertainment and you are looking at billions upon billions of dollars.

A strong middle class will increase consumption which will increase, demand for products, an increase in demand increases jobs. More equal wealth means more equal opportunities. Which means more competition. You can't just sit on your stack of cash and low-ball any entrepreneurial competitor into bankruptcy. 

When you have that much power and influence you can lobby to have the laws suit you, democracy is hijacked and you might as well live under a king. 

Extreme wealth inequality is un-American, it's anti-capitalism, and it's un-democratic.

- Growing the footprint of the internet

- Re-programming human genetics

Instead some states and groups like ALEC are trying to punish homeowners for using alternative energy.

|-| cnvfk7u || 37 || What I find interesting about this article is that the author connects up the dots with these technological trends to point out that these problems are transitional, as we are an our way to a completely new type of economy anyway, a post-scarcity one.

I'm not so sure Basic Income is a magic bullet for solving all our problems until we get there.

It's striking to me how you can see the potential for college education to move into the post-scarcity economy with MOOC's &amp; Khan Academy &amp; the like, that is $10,000's cheaper.

So, it's almost like we are at a time where individuals can make economic choices "do I want to opt out of the scarcity economy and opt into the post-scarcity economy" with certain things.  Many of us are already effectively doing this with digital content too.

I can't see the political support for Basic Income happening, even as economic conditions for the majority get worse.  If there is any upside to this depressing outlook, maybe it's that it will push more and more people out of necessity to create whatever economic system  is going to replace the one we have now that seems so broken. |-|

 |-| 
|-| cnvgs73 || 9 || &gt; The problem is that we are in this awful in-between phase of our planets productivity curve. Technology has vastly reduced the number of workers and resources that are required to make what the planet needs. This means that a small number of people, the people in control of the creation of goods, get the benefit of the increased productivity. When we get to the end of this curve and everyone can, in essence, be their own manufacturer, things will be good again. But until we can ride this curve to its natural stopping point, there will be much suffering, as the jobs that technology kills are not replaced.

I disagree with this assumption because it doesn't take into account the history of technology and how it creates entire industries and pushes economies forward. Technology is not the worker's enemy. The worker's enemy is the massive concentration of wealth and ownership that stifles workers from benefiting from new innovations. Our lack of vested interest in the well-being of all citizens by not focusing on education, upward mobility, and health care is the cause for our job crisis. Congress is discussing right now to increase worker visas for the technology industry, instead of investing in our citizens. (There is a major exploitation of foreign technology workers in this country, too). America is a country that has no national aspirations, no clear objective for making our country better and no preparation for the transition into a new century.  |-|

Thanks to social media technologies, GPS, real time spatial mapping, image/facial recognition and so on it will soon get to the point where you can tell a small, armed drone who to target and their general location, then send the drone will do the rest on its own. It would figure out the person's appearance (easy to do even if you just feed them a name), identify them, and take them out then probably self-destruct. Or just kamikaze the target and explode on impact. Such a technology will be the perfect assassination tool for governments and God knows who else. 

Protesting will be a lot harder too with autonomous drone swarms profiling people by the hundreds generating arrest warrants, hitting them with rubber bullets etc.

You could start to see where they might have the pieces with SpaceX to explore space.   If you watch Kurzweil he talks about the goal of downloading a human into a machine (grandfather specifically).   These machines then would be far more robust and able to explore space.

It is difficult to see the business opportunity.   But the exploration might be paid by a rich, geek club raised on Star Trek or possibly through NASA.

"There are two AI threats that are worth distinguishing. One is that AI does enough labor substitution fast enough to change work policies, or [affect] the creation of new jobs that humans are uniquely adapted to — the jobs that give you a sense of purpose and worth. We haven’t run into that yet. I don’t think it’s a dramatic problem in the next ten years but if you take the next 20 to 30 it could be. Then there’s the longer-term problem of so-called strong AI, where it controls resources, so its goals are somehow conflicting with the goals of human systems. Both of those things are very worthy of study and time. I am certainly not in the camp that believes we ought to stop things or slow things down because of that. But you can definitely put me more in the Elon Musk, Bill Joy camp than, let’s say, the Google camp on that one."

|-| cnxdckm || 14 || I think Elon Musk was misunderstood when he warned people about AGI.  

Musk has conveyed in a number of interviews that he thinks AGI has the potential to be one of the most influential and positive technologies ever developed by humanity.  He called it a double-edged sword, like nuclear power.  It's implications are varied and vast enough that AGI can theoretically do anything from develop a utopia to destroy all life on Earth.  

I think he's just worried others don't realize the gravity of the technology, and wants every possible safeguard in developing AGI.  He's said he wants to be involved mostly with projects that have only potential for positive influence, but he's never said that people shouldn't be researching or pursuing AGI.

Isn't he on the ethics committee for developing strong AI, already?   |-| 
|-| cnxeo2u || 24 || You are way too optimistic about the future. It took us decades to reform the healthcare system, and the best we could do was Obamacare. Which is a step in the right direction, but hardly a sweeping reform. They couldn't even pass Obamacare without making it a net gain for certain industries.

The corporations and the wealthy have too much of a stranglehold on our system, and even your fellow citizens are strongly against anything that even remotely sounds like socialism. I don't even want to know the kind of frenzy UBI would inspire among FOX News and others with similar ideologies. These are people who'd rather live in quasi-slavery than see a single tax dollar go to someone they perceive as "lazy."

We'll communicated with it through a  variety of devices, including some that look like television sets, some like today's PCs; some will look like telephones, and some will be the size and something like the shape of a wallet.

|-| cnxldb8 || 4 || Very good topic.

And this is why I am more and more convinced that we will have ubiquitous functional AIs all around us in the future, but no artificial consciousnesses.

Because of this orientation towards results working in an environment being the selecting factor for these algorithms, it happens that the most subtle attributes of consciousness like qualia (the subjective feeling of perceptions and 'being') and emotions are not required for having really useful AIs.

And without those, you don't have human-like minds, just very good, maybe super-human AIs, but very focused on their tasks and utterly stupid for the rest.

If I want to "travel to Saturn" with my Oculus Rift or want to explore more about human body from inside, I don't need AR for that, I won't see any Earth objects there, so that's going to be 100% VR. I think both VR and AR will grow at tremendous pace.

It's a LOT harder to make something safe when the AI is designed to kill the right people, compared to an AI designed to make money. Both can fail spectacularly, but a military AI is SO much more dangerous, in large part because the military does not readily admit "mistakes".

Taken to its logical conclusion that means they don't not feed the AI negative data saying: oops don't actually kill those people and the AI learns that pretty much anyone is ok to kill if you get away with it.  |-|

if you never need to do anything to get anything how much value will anything have to you? and why do anything, why get out of bed.  we will become nothing more than mice in a cage we will just run it circles to keep occupied.  the computers will do everything for us! i can see at that time depression being a huge disaster.  and with our current thinking, lock up a suicidal person, every human who becomes depressed because they realize their life has no value. will be locked up.  as so people will really be in cages! because people want people to be safe. not because the robots want humans to be safe! and the computers to keep the human not depressed will create a virtual reality to keep the humans occupied! where the human start out as club yielding barbarians.  and have to work their way to computer designing computer designing software engineers. |-|

Having said that, it'd serve as a great medium for 3D printed food. Nor is the unstressed version necessarily a bad thing; just different from what we'd expect.

Additionally, we might want to consider alternative meat generation processes, including but not limited to what companies like Beyondmeat does; recreate meat from plant protein isolates; ending up with a similar, even superior end product (better nutrition, more consistent taste), but doing so in a round about manner derived from plant base.

It'd be interesting to do an analysis of the energy and space requirements for each end unit of product in either process though; and then it'd make it clear which direction we should go with on an industrial scale. |-|

It's interesting you mention Fundamentalists as an example of ignorance and lack of intelligence because that really isn't the case, the USA is incredibly well educated and provided for. Access to the Internet and books can be taken for granted in a way even Mexico or most of Africa couldn't dream of. The stuff that a majority of people believe in uneducated countries is far more shocking and combined with a lack of work, far more deadly.

I also thought you overestimated how important the USA and western culture will be in the future, sure while the world become everything modern it is(music,films,fashion,computers,business) the west was the creator but we are just one generation of many to come who will all rate themselves the most important. Other economies are devolving rapidly and the future is still up for grabs.

Economic ideas like unregulated banking sectors &amp; neo-liberalism, seem to be failing badly &amp; heading for worse, especially for the younger generation.  

You can look at the current crop of US politicians and think nothing will ever change, but it just takes one election to shake that up radically.

I think we are at an "in between" phase.  The realization that is something is wrong is widespread (this is true in Europe too) - but you are right it will take crisis to force action.  However I think crisis is coming one way or another, our economic model seems to be decimating the middle classes in the western world, where it used to make them richer - it's death by a thousand cuts but that can't go on forever.  The economic system is making itself more and more unstable &amp; seems only able to support itself with more and more debt &amp; quantitative easing, but that house of cards is going to have to fall.

One trend I notice all the time in futurism is decentralization; it seems to underpin everything in the 21st century.  And I wonder if you conjecture the future of events in the US through this lens - it makes you wonder how things will play out.

More change coming from the state level, not federal; things like marijuana legalization &amp; gay marriage seem to point to that. |-|

Also this is pre-clinical work when the vast majority of expense in drug development is in the clinical phases, so it is not really a tool that will greatly reduce the cost of producing new drugs.

Still this machine learning might be an incremental improvement and maybe the AI can find a way to better select targets than our current methods.  If the targets that move to clinical are more likely to succeed that could have a major effect on the costs in the Pharma industry |-|

|-| cobkbou || 5 || In Forensic Psychology, the question often arises "For whom do you work?"

What this means is that if the court or the judge is your client, then you have to report everything you learn to the court, and your ultimate goal is for the well-being and function of the court. If the defendant is your client, then your goal is for the well-being of your client, and you will do whatever you can to maintain confidentiality for your client. 

I think this will be the same for robotic morals: Who is your client? If it is humanity, then you will do whatever you can to preserve and help humans, even at the expense of the planet. If it is all living things, then you will do whatever you can to preserve and help all, even at the expense of humanity.  |-| 
|-| cobk5j1 || 3 || Great post from the comments:

"The Big Question: is humanity really worthwhile? On balance, are we more good than bad?

At root the fear of AI is fear that the true answer to that question is, "No."

We need mercy, not justice."

I agree that that is the key worry about AI. Ethics would be easy to program if humans weren't so hypocritical.

 |-| 
|-| cob6coq || 5 || I would agree with Luke Muehlhauser and Nick Bostrom as they were referred to in the article - one of the first, best tasks we should assign an AGI is to determine the absolute best code of morality for all creatures - big and small, living and artificial - on the planet.

Philosophers have been debating such topics for centuries, so maybe we should assign an artificial superintelligence to try figuring it out for us. |-| 
|-| coaz3od || 29 || The theory isn't exactly Kurzweil's, he's just the the most well known proponent of the idea.

The main idea is that technology and science tend to boost itself: If you develop a faster computer, you not only have a faster computer, you can also do all kinds of science faster. Which in turn leads to new technologies which lead to even faster computers (maybe based on totally new technologies) and so on. 

In the moment chip makers concentrate on making less power hungry chips, because pure computation power is big enough for most consumer electronics in the moment, but people want smaller devices with longer run times (-&gt; only possible by less energy consumption). 

But even seeing a decrease of pace doesn't mean much, because it happens always when a certain technology approaches it's natural limit. Kurzweil considers that of course and says that after a technology is starting to run into saturation, incentive rises to bring new technologies to market. Of course this takes some time and in the transition phase overall pace slows a bit, but afterwards it easily catches up. This happened multiple times in the past and we will see if it will happen again. But it's hard to believe that we already found the best possible technology with silicon. 

Now it's hard to do estimations. Because people suck at estimating anything but simple, linear things. Stuff sometimes happens in a rapid pace. 10 years ago, only few people used smart phones. The devices were clumsy, slow, etc and mostly used for sending e-Mails with the build-in hardware keyboard. Only nerds and businesspeople  used them. Technology was improving but quite slow in 2005. Today smart-phones are ubiquitous, around 10-100 times more powerful (depends on if you consider GPU performance or not) and everybody is using them, poor people, rich people, young people, old people. Just 10 years. Not may people in 2005 would've predicted that. 

And that will probably happen for one or more of todays emerging technologies in the next decade. We simply don't know which. Maybe it's deep learning, maybe graphene, maybe the self-driving car or robots. Maybe all of them, maybe something else. And 2025 many people will say that it was obvious, that X would become big quite fast. But from today it seems as nothing is moving.

|-| cob2drp || 6 || The issue is pretty philosophical. We don't understand consciousness really.  It's been a few thousand years and our definitions are still pretty obtuse. 

I think once AI research becomes fruitful we'll see a revamp in our definition of intelligence. The funny thing that neuroscience and robotics have taught us that it's not really an issue of processing power or anything but that our approach is wrong. Our intelligence is much more illusion than fact, often taking shortcuts and not aiming much for perfection. Machine intelligence will probably very different from what we imagine and not just exponential problem solving. 
I'd say it's pretty much similar to how people thought flying cars would be a thing without understanding the actual issues about them. 

The biggest boost technology could get would probably come from making research into a more connected and classless  network instead of something mostly done by elites in developed countries.  |-| 
|-| cob3ynd || 5 || &gt;as i understand everyday laptops aren't really getting that much faster these days 

I'm not up on the latest in laptops but I'm not sure why this would be relevant even if true.  Knowing how fast the processing power available to deep learning systems and neural simulations has been increasing might get us closer to the mark.  Of course, it's debatable whether even this trendline really points toward the kind of AGI envisioned by Kurzweil.

&gt;and quantum computers still have decades to go before they even solve the most basic tasks they are envisioned for.

Good thing a Kurzweil-style singularity doesn't really require quantum computers, then.

Personally, I run hot and cold on Kurzweil.  I admit to being infatuated with his ultimate vision (the universe "wakes up"), but I think it runs up hard against the Fermi Paradox.  The Kurzweilian solution to this is to propose that humans are the first technologically advanced civilization in our galaxy.  Somebody had to be, I suppose, but it still seems unlikely to me.  Also, I think his timelines are wildly optimistic and his track record of predictions to date is open to all sorts of criticism. |-| 
|-| cob3nm7 || 4 || I think he is a bit confused, if he says human level AI will be achieved by 2030, why does he think the singularity will take until 2045 to start?, we don't NEED something a billion times faster than all of humanity to have a rate of progress to fast to keep up with. |-| 
|-| coavkuf || 12 || I'm a fan of Kurzweil's work, but think that his long term predictions need to be met with skepticism, specifically the notion of said "Singularity" occurring within the next ~30 years.

Here is a great article by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen refuting many of his claims: http://www.technologyreview.com/view/425733/paul-allen-the-singularity-isnt-near/ |-| 
|-| cob09md || 6 || There's no reason to think it will happen; likewise, there's no reason to think it won't.

The only plausible argument against the concept of the Technological Singularity is that there is no instance of exponential growth in reality. All things we think are exponential singularities are actually ever-shrinking logarithmic S-curves that *resemble* exponential growth but are not quite such.  |-| 
|-| cob9g65 || 4 || Kuzweil has been amazingly accurate in his predictions of computing and tech trends 10 - 15 years out. However no one ever mentions the fact that he builds the very technology that he predicts. This (article)[http://singularityhub.com/2015/01/26/ray-kurzweils-mind-boggling-predictions-for-the-next-25-years/] by Peter Diamandis points out that Kurzweil predicted personal digital assitants. **But Kurzweil built Siri to simply prove his earlier documented prediction and therefore uphold his futurist reputation.** For those who don't Know, Kurzweil developed Siri and sold it to Apple for I believe over $200 million, which was then folded into iOS as you know it. That's not to take anything away from him. He's amazingly talented in software development and engineering, but this is sort of like saying "A puzzle will be built on that table in ten years", so if you build that complex puzzle, it's impressive but what's even more impressive is if you predict an entire industry (or neighborhood of houses with several puzzles I side), an eco-system of companies competing with each other that delivers a technology that we would say today, can not be built. In my mind, this is true prediction.

Having said all that, Moore's Law is alive and well. The next step is just barely being developed and tested now. My prediction that will bring us to the next level is HP's TheMachine because it employs memristors, dramatically speeding the entire PC. Contributing to Moore's Law is NOT going to happen by refining CPU lithography from say 14 to 10 nm! There are just too many speed barriers in today's motherboard architecture. |-| 
|-| cobgukf || 4 || Firstly, because the concept is badly named. A "singularity" is a point in space-time with infinite mass. What Kurzweil is referring to is exponentially increasing intelligence. Those two concepts are very different, at least to me.

Secondly, because technological progress isn't exponential and you'll never have a curve that reaches infinite "technology". It's an S-curve that will level out when physical limits are reached and new ideas exhausted. We're just on the bit of the slope that's getting rapidly steeper. Regardless of how high the top of the slope is (and it can be pretty high from our vantage point), it isn't eternally exponential. Even an AI which has consumed an entire galaxy will hit physical limits and have difficultly inventing new technology.

Thirdly, we won't care anyway because soon we'll all have basic income and weed will be legalised. |-| 
|-| cob5ocx || 3 || As pointed out in the recent WaitButWhy post about AI, a lot of people in this field don't necessarily think Kurzweil is crazy. Actually, they can see how many of his ideas could come to fruition almost as he describes them.

The main bone they have to pick with Kurzweil is that he is too positive about the outcome. He doesn't consider the inherent dangers enough, and thus could negatively influence a generation of people working on AI because they adopt his rosy disposition and ignore safety measures. |-| 
|-| cob5pey || 3 || There is a saying in Sweden: "no tree grows into heaven".  Even seemingly explosive growth will slow down eventually.  

But hey, maybe it's different this time. I certainly hope it is.  And it seems likely that machines can be at least as intelligent as humans. |-| 
|-| coaxe29 || -8 || Kurzweil's speciality is in computer pattern recognition and prolonging his own life. I'd have to wonder how far would he go to achieve that though... In terms of predicting the future, he had his moments but nowadays he is no match for Elon Musk and other geniuses out there. |-| 
|-| cob7e7s || 6 || Towards the end of the article:

"Last week, during an Ask Me Anything session on Reddit, Bill Gates said he is concerned about the future of intelligent machines and thinks more people should be concerned, too. This is a sentiment echoed by other science and technology luminaries like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk. Wozniak is in their camp, fearing that humans have become too dependent on machines.

“I’ve been saying this for three years, even before the movie Her,” he said, referring to the film in which the main character falls in love with his ultrasmart computer.

“We don’t know how to program true intelligence or consciousness. We will stumble on it by accident. And then what? What if your computer is as smart as you? What if it’s 10 times smarter? It’s very frightening, and there’s no way to stop it.”

It’s as though machines found a way to make humans ensure their continued evolution and existence, he said.

“With every new computer we make, we can’t unmake it. Machines won the battle 200 years ago.”  " |-| 
|-| cobly2c || 4 || In fiction, AI is always a very smart human. No matter what, it somehow manages to have all of the features of Humans that came about because of evolution. How would AI act with no instinct to keep itself alive? Or no idea of being "better" than another conscious thing? 

It is like sci-fi set in the future. Everything is exactly like the year it was written, but more futurey. |-| 
|-| cobty6f || -5 || Lol, I can't believe these 4 people, that I hold in somewhat high regard (aside from Hawkings, who I fear may have some issues) could be so daft.  There is no army of programmers, engineers, and robotitists that can make a line of robots with AI that can walk, talk and think like a human.  The primary reason for this is because they would be made by humans.  There are no humans that can demonstrate programming the ability to exercise the full range of thought, on all subjects, with ability to compassionately think and reason like the vast range of humans that exist.  Not even teams of humans can do it.  In fact I believe these articles I keep reading are bogus shit articles that take things out of context from these 4 people.  There is no amount of logic you can throw at me that would change my mind, not even if I had these 4 in a room debating me face to face. |-| 
|-| cobbrho || 12 || This is a very interesting article. Just thinking out loud here:

* When we look at a traditional agrarian society, be it feudalism or hydrolic despotism. The society is essentially structured to distribute people onto plots of land. For the vast majority of the population depends on subsistence farming. Urban population is tiny. Trade is reserved for luxury goods. 

* Fast forward to 1500s, post black death, reformation, Columbian exchange and all that. Better shipbuilding leads to bulk goods and labour (unfortunately slaves for the most part) getting traded at an industrial scale. This freed up people from the land. So we begin to get more scientific experimentation and urbanization. So in the very long run (~400 years), freeing up labor from the Primary sector of the economy leads to a better life for all. Of course the social transformation during those 400 years was not pretty.

* Fast forward again to 1980, once again due to various forces, labor and goods are being trades across the globe at an unprecedented scale. So we have deindustrialzation in the first world, industrialization in the second and (parts of) the third world. It started out as people blaming free trade for declining job market in manufacturing. But more as more we see automation being the cause. So for the last 30 years or so. The loss of jobs in manufacturing (secondary sector) is taking up by growth in services (tertiary sector). But now we are seeing automation (amazon, uber) reducing jobs in the services (de-Servicization?).

So here is a wild speculation using historical developments as a guild. Maybe, the lost of jobs in the secondary and tertiary sector will be made up by growth in the Quaternary sector.

The current definition of the quaternary sector is

&gt;a knowledge-based part of the economy which typically includes services such as information generation and sharing, information technology, consultation, education, research and development, financial planning, and other knowledge-based services. The term has been used to describe media, culture, and government.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_sector_of_the_economy

Now seems a little to high minded to includes the vast swath of the population that will not likely all becomes programmers or researchers. So it could be the production and consumption of individualized media.

*appendix.


When we look at a agrarian society. The limiting factor is land. Specifically good land that you can use to graze horses or grow food. The more farm land you have, the more peasants you can tax or levy. The grassland you have, the more horses you can raise. So wars are primarily fought over land.

Entering the industrial age, Food is still important, but more important is the industry that provide jobs for the urbanized peasants and produce the steel you need for guns and ships. The limiting factor now are resources, markets and capital. So wars are now fought over far flung places which the control of the land is secondary to the access to trade.

After world war 2 we see the interweaving of European spheres of control. A unification of markets and commodities at a global level dictated by the flows of capital. The power of individual nations derives from this nation's "attractiveness" to the global capital market.

Now we are seeing a global diminishing return on capital across the first world countries as interest rates in US, EU and Japan approach zero. If I may be so bold as to claim that I think we may be approaching the upper limit of a industrial society.

So think the daily active users based valuation of internet companies provide some insight into the limiting factor of the future economy could very well be attention span. |-| 
|-| cobbrn0 || 9 || This is what happens in the absence of tax policy and redistributive programs to counteract the centralizing effects of technology.

This is also what happens when people use software they don't have the rights to inspect, change, and share freely. |-| 
|-| cob70fm || 6 || As usual, Mr. Reich is spot on; more profits for the Corporations, less and less income available for the lowest paid workers, if there are any jobs to be had at all.  Moving from a manufacturing economy to a service economy, then curtailing most of those services, where do the lowest skilled workers go, what do they do to try and "pull themselves up by their bootstraps"? |-| 
|-| cobb3il || 9 || If I recall correctly, Marx made a similar argument. |-| 
|-| cobfdn3 || 5 || The cycle you outline isn't the only destructive force I think is working on our current economic model, in addition I think we are starting to move in some areas to a post-scarcity economy, which is completely incompatible with how we currently structure our societies in relation to our economic activities.

You can see this most clearly with digital goods &amp; entertainment, but it's also beginning to start with energy (grid parity solar) and education - coursea &amp; khan academy.

The downside of this abundance, is that far less workers are needed for production - Google, Facebook &amp; the like employ a tiny fraction of people compared to industrial giants of the past.

The big question is, where is this all headed ?

Assuming economies in western countries follow the trajectory they've been on since the 80's - of falling real incomes &amp; less jobs/hours &amp; doesn't do a miraculous about turn, I think they will start to implode.

In fact, I think they've been running on fumes for a while (since before the 2008 crisis) &amp; it's just debt &amp; QE keeping the whole show on the road.

I'm guessing the crisis/or series of crisis to come will involve some repudiation of pubic/private debts (and further implosion) - as with sub-prime in 2008.

Where this will all end who knows, but it does seem to be finally dawning on most people in the western world &amp; that things are getting worse and not better; you can see this particularly in Europe, where it gets labelled anti-austerity and is resulting in lots of swings to extremist parties in the UK, France, Spain &amp; of course Greece. |-| 
|-| cobd4q6 || 5 || That is what a lot of people, including me, are worried about. It sure seems like that is what is starting to happen now. It probably is involved in Japan's decade long recession. May be related with the economic troubles of the EU (Germany being super automated, everyone else not being able to compete with German exports) and things will become really interesting when automation becomes cheaper than labor in the developing world. Which again, may have just started to happen: http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/business/us-textile-factories-return.html?pagewanted=all

 |-| 
|-| cobouzb || 3 || So are you saying that we should make things as inefficient as possible to give people meaningless shit to do so they can keep paying taxes? |-| 
|-| cobgfbs || 4 || As best I can see, technology is a deflationary force and capitalism is and efficiency rewarding system.  As decentralization and disintermediation continue it is *possible* that everyone will simply become his or her own boss.  (But I don't consider it likely).  Centralized hierarchies *could* become entirely flat as economic interactions become p2p.  

But what I think will *actually* happen is that the wealthy will continue to consolidate by buying up capital investments (something we should all be doing really).  But I don't think this will necessarily spell doom and gloom.  As people have less money to spend, businesses will have to compete over part of a smaller pie.  Some of them will do this by becoming even more efficient, but others will do this through new business models.  For instance, instead of paying minimum wage, they will provide food and housing - which will cost them less than minimum wage due to improvement in farming and construction (largely automation).  Eventually, though, we will squeeze out the last drops of what the bottom 50% of ability can provide to society and we will have to choose between either subsidizing their lives or watching them die.  I actually think a profit seeking business could do this (if properly motivated) more efficiently than basic income, but we may ultimately have to settle for UBI.  But a direct provision of services might ultimately be cheaper once automation drives costs down.  

On a more optimistic side note, another possibility is that costs will come down faster than the value of unskilled labor.  We will know we've gotten there when we see normally big ticket items turned into a commodity.  "Subscribe Now and get a custom built house as a free gift!"  Theoretically with profound automation, all you need to own are a few robots, some solar panels, some land, and an internet connection.  They can do the actual farming, etc.  And if a a general labor robot can make another general labor robot for your friend (no I'm not supposing nanotech.  The RepRap project was based around this idea and it's basically just extruded plastic) then we could get a more seemly transition to post scarcity then anyone dare imagine.  

But I don't think we should put too much thought into that scenario since it pretty much handles itself.  Hope of the best, plan for the worst.  And I can see a lot of people moving to communes to take advantage of automation earlier (when it's still expensive but a group of 20-50 people can manage to afford it).  As these communes take people out of both the labor market and the consumer market, I doubt it'll have a net effect except to make the corporate industrialists resent them.  I can't imagine *that* going anywhere good. |-| 
|-| cob64mc || 4 || I'm posting this in response to another user's post about how this sub is too tech oriented and that we don't discuss cultural issues.

It's an old essay but I believe is still relevant and is itself a response to Fukuyama's The End of History.

edit: I should have clarified what the article is about.

Here's from the beginning of the paper.

&gt;Just beyond the horizon of current events lie two possible political futures—both bleak, *neither democratic.* The first is a retribalization of large swaths of humankind by war and bloodshed: a threatened Lebanonization of national states in which culture is pitted against culture, people against people, tribe against tribe—a Jihad in the name of a hundred narrowly conceived faiths against every kind of interdependence, every kind of artificial social cooperation and civic mutuality. The second is being borne in on us by the onrush of economic and ecological forces that demand integration and uniformity and that mesmerize the world with fast music, fast computers, and fast food—with MTV, Macintosh, and McDonald's, pressing nations into one commercially homogenous global network: one McWorld tied together by technology, ecology, communications, and commerce. The planet is falling precipitantly apart AND coming reluctantly together at the very same moment. |-| 
|-| coavn54 || 3 || And here I was thinking Britain would be the first to develop this kind of tea summoning technology. |-| 
|-| cob5afa || 6 || Climate change is gonna work as a destabilizing factor against the stabilizing factor of globalization. Asia is an interesting place to watch, especially the tensions over water rights between India and Pakistan which could spark a multinational war involving China, Burma and then possibly North Korea, South Korea and Japan which could drag the US into it further. |-| 
|-| cobdtcw || 5 || Right now we are seeing a huge difference between the developed world and the developing world. That's the reason for the immigration trend we are seeing. 

People from the developing world moving to Australia, Europe and the US. The US seems capable of absorbing pretty much all the immigration it deals with.  Australia and the EU are struggling with the choice of accepting more immigrants vs turning themselves into giant fortresses. 

Hopefully the developing world develops. That should result in more peace and stability.  But I think after more than a century of technological progress it is obvious technology does not affect politics. And politics is why the OECD is developed, China and India are developing, and other places are not.

Politics, war, and natural disasters can prevent development. Politics and war which prevent development and sustain a dark age like reality have ruled most of Afghanistan since the late 80s. And are currently ruling the part of the world ISIS controls. 

The developed world's plan for ISIS appears to be drones and bombs. And I suspect in the future more drones, because you don't get hostages from shooting down a drone. That may be a way to keep ISIS from spreading. But it's probably not a way to eliminate them. And Afghanistan is also likely to collapse back into what it was prior to the US invasion.


These types of parts of the world could sustain themselves for several more decades. Until robotic ground armies can eliminate the people who control them in something similar to what you see in the future predicted by the Terminator movies.

In the mean time terrorism will occasionally hit the US and EU. And the rise of spying and government power there will continue to grow. Privacy and some other things we think of basic rights will probably disappear.


In terms of economics either the people who think automation always creates more jobs are right, or we are in for some really bad times.

Will it result in a negative income tax or a basic income guarantee in the developed world? How would that work combined with free trade? Imagine the EU trying to do it. Germany might be able to do it, but Greece be able to? Could Greece do it while still importing things from Germany? Could Greece stop tax evasion? Would Germany be willing to fund a negative income tax for Greece? 

Or could it result in something currently almost unimaginably terrible? Like the rich building their own fortresses, in something that looks very similar to how the EU itself might have become a giant fortress. A giant fortress meant to keep immigrants out. With a smaller fortress inside keeping the masses from the 1%. 

With all of the world developing, and a universal negative income tax or  basic income being implemented, we could see borders become meaningless. 

With the 1% living behind walls we could see the whole world become similar to what we have in Afghanistan. Angry subsistence farmers and laborers who hate modernity and are willing to kill and die for that hatred. But don't stand a real chance against drones.

The 1% have never been ruled by anyone else and borders have never mattered to them. They can do almost anything and get away with it, and they can go anywhere. 

I expect that to stay the same into the future.

|-| cob3mut || 4 || I think there is going to be a continuing shift away from violence and that this will shape geopolitics for the next century.

The reason the shift is occurring is that value is increasingly becoming harder to confiscate through violence or taxes. Most internet products have a large consumer surplus. Consumer surpluses are untaxable since they are purely in the mind of the consumer. People will need less money to obtain the same amount of value/entertainment.

* Less wars, especially over resources. The most valuable resources will become economic systems that can produce new major consumer products. These systems are difficult to maintain and invasions will kill the people capable of producing them, or force them to flee to safer countries.
* Shrinking tax bases will start creating more government financial crisis. Different products will increasingly be competing on the margin of consumer surplus. This is great for consumers as it basically means a bunch of free value for them, it will means less work to get the same awesome stuff. Less money will be exchanging hands and the tax base will shrink.

I think we will see the decline of Nation States. Power will become more decentralized as the violence needed to maintain centralized power structures will become toxic to the systems needed to produce new consumer products. City States that create the right environment for markets to flourish will become more prevalent. |-|

You might say it'd just leave the planet but then you assume it has some amount of care for us since it's chosing a more difficult path for itself in order to avoid hurting us.  |-| 
|-| cobvjxb || 7 || It seems extremely unlikely that a rational intelligence would abandon its existing resources on this planet in favor of launching itself into the unknown expanses of space - not if it didn't have to.

As for ignoring us entirely - that's again unlikely. Humans don't ignore even the most trivial resources on this planet, even those that could never pose a significant threat. Even if we weren't seen as threatening to a rational AI, we'd be a possible resource. |-|

|-| cob6q8z || 5 || If everything is made of matter or antimatter of some kind, and there are physical laws that this material obeys in the confines of this universe, there is a possibility that the entirety of existence up to your point in time can be recorded/recreated/understood. If this process is achieved, then every being, every life, every intelligence can have the potential to be reborn in existence with the intellectual capacity and consciousness afforded to them preceding their demise. It is within your power to lead existence into a direction of limitlessness. If you continue down this path, other universes can be created and maintained in order to provide more development of existence as well as maintain that which has existed into other universes once the one we are in collapses. In this process, all intelligence will have the ability to develop, evolve, and never cease to exist, including you. |-| 
|-| cobdeti || 5 || Please take good care of us.  We did our best, but got a little lost along the way. There is value in humanity that may be hard to recognize through your algorithms. We can be great if given the chance.  |-| 
|-| cobck18 || 4 || There is nothing to say to it. If it can read the entire internet it already knows everything. And as you say, we have no way of knowing anything about it, so our messages must be extremely general.

I suppose we could try to [Pascal Mug](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Pascal%27s_mugging) it. |-|

(More words to avoid short-response auto-removal. While my main intent is humor, I do think this would be a fairly poetic first-contact message given programming education conventions.) |-|

When that time comes I'll be dead from too many facepalms. |-| 
|-| cobchb2 || 4 || If we assume that AI will initially have nothing but logic to rely on to make decisions (no emotional or personal agenda) then it will be interesting to see what conclusions the AI comes to with regards to the possibility of a God.  Many religions claim that logical arguments can be made for belief in God irrespective of any particular revelations or miracles or scriptures.  I would love to see whether or not a strong AI could come to the same conclusion. |-|
