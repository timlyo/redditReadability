|-| cnua0sr || 7 || Everyone here seems to have watched all of the LotR films **before** seeing the Hobbit films. I think this needs the opinion of someone who completely forgot about (basically hasn't seen) the first trilogy.

In my case - I hadn't - the last time I saw LotR I was 7 and I barely remembered any of it going in. I haven't read the books either.

I actually really enjoyed the entire Hobbit trilogy as a whole.

**First film**

I actually think this was the worst. The beginning was *so* boring. The first 45 minutes of the film might as well have not been there. But it brought the story in slowly and by the end I was really excited to see the second one.

**Second Film**

The second was probably my favourite to be honest. While, again, the smaug scene was very dragged out, it gave you a sense of the passage of time throughout the film. Seeing Killi and Tauriel's relationship unfold was one of the highlights. The bits in between were some great bits of storytelling and action as well.

**Third movie**

I really liked this one too. To be honest I would have prefered if Smaug died in the second and it was made half an hour longer, but I can see why it was put in at the beginning (for people who hadn't watched the second one). I'm not a huge fan of the whole hour long battle thing, but it was interesting to watch nonetheless. The plotline involving Thorin was nice and I really empathised with Bilbo. The only thing I felt was out of place was Sauron's plotline. It didn't seem to have a huge emphasis on the story.

Overall, it was a really nice trilogy and I'm glad I watched it.

Going into the main LotR trilogy (which I watched extended versions of all), there were a few bits I picked up on that I otherwise would've had no idea about if I hadn't seen the Hobbit, such as the mithril chainmail, Thorin and Aragorn. It was a nice integration.

Tl;dr not sure why everyone bashes the second hobbit film, thought it was great. The hobbit trilogy was a nice introduction to the LotR universe. |-|

They should have made the *Lord of the Rings* into at least six movies then. That probably would have made the Middle Earth geeks happier because they would have been closer to including everything. Hindsight is 20-20 I guess. |-|

Precisely nobody ever hears a car alarm go off and thinks "Oh my god, someone's stealing that car!!"  They only ever think "someone shut that fucking thing off please." |-| 
|-| cnv550t || 5 || Well, firstly its more like a city state like ancient Athens or renaissance Venice.  

Secondly, its not like Singapore suddenly sprouted up 70 years ago.  Its been a major city/seaport for centuries and they have their own culture and mythology.  If you look at east Asia in general, Singapore is actually one of the older existing governments.   |-|

|-| cnv5aes || 51 || Singapore the island likely predates hominids; Singapore the city has been around in some form for millennia. The city has been economically significant since the early 19th century. Singapore predates Dr. Who and the entire scifi genre.

Dr. Who might predate the current form of government, but that's not unique. Germany, as currently comprised, never saw *any* production of Dr. Who before Paul McGann. The French government predates Dr. Who by merely 5 years. Greece was reconstituted in 1975; Portugal in 1976; Spain in 1976. South Korea wasn't considered developed until the 1990s; Chile was accorded first world status only in the last 10 years or so.

**TL;DR:** Singapore is older than Dr. Who. Many countries changed their economic and political status in the last 50 years.

|-| cnv5rvv || 3 || The reason they don't is that more often than not it has nothing to do with you.

I hire literally dozens of people every year.)

I always give prompt feedback after a decision has been made about a candidate.  "We appreciate your interest but are pursuing other opportunities concerning this position" is more or less a go-to.

I've replied to well-written rebuts only a handful of times; the bottom line for me is that I'm not a career counselor and do not feel qualified to give out advice about what people should do in the future for other interviews.  They may be a perfect candidate as they are for another job, just not this one in particular. |-|

|-| cnvigib || 9 || This needs to be a regular thing, actually.  Light pollution is more damaging to the environment than most people imagine.  It's not pitch black at night, there is light from the stars and moon, and certain creatures are very sensitive to the light of night.  

Sea turtles for instance, whose population decrease is largely responsible for the population increase of jellyfish, are drawn to the sea when they first hatch by the reflection of moonlight off of the water.  In certain locations and at certain times, a store keeping their lights on would mean the sea turtles are drawn to its location rather than the water because of the overpowering light.  Those that don't make it to the water die.

Today if the lights go out at night, people call the police because of the strange clouds in the sky, not understanding that they are merely observing the galaxy for the first time.  Light pollution has stolen from the minds of the people that wonder which comes from gazing into the heavens. |-|

Earth Hour's logo
Earth Hour is a worldwide movement for the planet organized by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The event is held worldwide annually encouraging individuals, communities, households and businesses to turn off their non-essential lights for one hour, from 8:30 to 9:30 p.m. on the last Saturday in March, as a symbol for their commitment to the planet.[1] It was famously started as a lights-off event in Sydney, Australia in 2007. Since then it has grown to engage more than 7000 cities and towns worldwide. Today, Earth Hour engages a massive mainstream community on a broad range of environmental issues. The one-hour event continues to remain the key driver of the now larger movement.

Earth Hour 2014 was on Saturday, March 29, from 8:30 pm to 9:30 pm in a location's local time. Earth Hour 2015 will be on Saturday, March 28, from 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. during participants' local time. |-|

My friends manager would often answer the phone, and he would always get annoyed and pissed off. Imagine Carl, from Aquateen, but shorter with more body hair.

|-| cnvz1mq || 5 || I worked at a video store years ago and some lady came in to rent a movie or two. I said "Oh, happy birthday!" and she just backed away from the counter and left the store (without her movies). I never saw her there again.

I'm telling you all this because if you fail I'm holding you responsible!

**Nah just kidding! :-)**

I am telling you this though to perhaps give you inspirations. I'm assuming if you're doing neuroanatomy you're doing something like neurosurgery or neuroscience or some other thing. 

Perhaps then remembering why you're doing it might give you the inspiration to find that last X factor.

If you do fail it though chin up. It happens, take a breather and take another crack at it. Again, remember why you're doing it. Brains are bloody complicated shit.

It's because of the neuro people before you (be it surgeons or scientists or radiologists etc) that I might get an extra 6 months on prognosis. I might get an extra time added to my scale. I might tack 6 months onto my current 33years which percentage wise is a shitload. Buying me 6 months of time is like winning every lottery ever. 

*Who knows what you can accomplish?*

Pass or fail this test? Obviously try damn hard, but should you fail, big friendly handshake from me and say take another crack mate we're counting on you.

I was surprised when he stopped what he was doing and got me a roll of toilet paper.  I thanked him when he passed it to me and he told me with a smile, "Wow, you're so nice!"  I was shocked.  I was basically being polite, and he thanks me for it.  What kind of monster customers are in this Subway that being polite gets me a compliment? |-| 
|-| cnxfs3v || 9 || The universe is about 14 billion years old. The first stars didn't form for about a billion years after the big bang.  It took our biome (earth) about 4.5 billion years from formation of the planet to intelligent life. Even if our star went Nova at the end of its life, which it won't because it's not massive enough, that is still another 5 billion years from now. So realistically the number of alien species that could have come into existence and then had their atoms scattered by their star's death couldn't be more than one or two assuming evolution follows a similar path.  |-|

|-| cnxn3vi || 98 || Back when I worked at a Dairy Queen in my teenage years we did do this. The cash register had a button that would add a "see server" note to an order, noting that the customer had asked for a request that the register was not programmed to display to the cooks, so they would have to come up to us to ask what needed to be done.

We had an unwritten rule amongst the employees there that if you added a series of 3 "see server" notes in a row on the order, it was meant to show they were really cool and should be served gratuitously.

The managers caught on after awhile and asked us to stop, but there are people out there who do that. |-|

|-| cnxp2z8 || 51 || When I was working at McDonald's many years ago the registers had something called an ask me button. I was going to college in Kentucky at the time and lived in a poor rural community where people kind of looked out for one another.

We'd routinely get people coming through that were extremely poor. I and several other cashiers would ring up their order which was generally a tiny dollar menu sandwich and waters and hit the ask me button. Then we'd do stuff like switch out the reg-meat for quarter pounder meat, load 'em up with apple pies and stuff that were about to go past the allotted time for the racks, and give them free drinks. 

Everybody looked the other way about it. It was really cool the way everybody banded together to help a community largely plagued by a lack of jobs paying livable wages. My managers used to sneak eggs and other 'expired' foods out the back to bring to local shelters and anything still viable from waste went home with employees.

It made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside to see people with the least doing the most they could every day to help another human being.

Whenever someone was polite I would give them additional roast beef and make sure their sandwich was really nicely made (freshly toasted bun, all toppings well distributed, etc).  Whenever someone was a jerk, they would get a sloppy piece of shit sandwich with a stale bun.

Always be nice when ordering fast food, you never know who is listening.

While the vast majority of the bodies have had their clothes eaten by mold, out of the ones that still have clothes, most corpses probably have a big split down the back of their tops (and some possibly their pants). 

Dressing a body can be a quick endeavor if your lucky, especially if they're a skinny old person. The problem cases are when you get larger people or people who had bad edema or not so bright family members, then its about as bad as trying to dress a crazed 4 year old who is hopped up on PCP and knows your on a schedule. So when you get stuck, you make "alterations" and cut the clothes where people cant see, wrap the halves over the body and then use some string to pull the back half tight so it looks like the clothes are intact. I was big on trying to keep clothes intact, but we had another worker who cut everything but underwear (she swore it was faster that way). Long story short, most funeral clothes are a square knot away from just falling down or out of place. It can be hilarious when your coworker splits a women's blouse before checking where the tag is and you only have 10 minutes before the service...

Also, now days, families dont necessarily stick with traditional dressings and provide everything under the sun from sweats and muumuus to street clothes and t-shirts or requesting grandma not to wear panties because that was her...style. Yes I got stuck with that one. |-|

Anyway, the first time we met as a group I arrived early and she was second. We had all e-mailed to meet at the cafe. She was a little stand-offish to me as a stranger, but I was polite and smiled. We chose our scene, the opening to Henry V with the death of Falstaff. I had this great analysis about Shakespeare's analogy to the Death of Socrates which I had just read in a book my brother gave me by his Shakespeare prof at Dartmouth. She smiled and her stare lingered a little bit before she spoke up to agree that the scene was the one we should do. We met a few more times where we all became friendlier. I never mentioned her career or treated her differently. I could tell she always waited for people to mention it. I saw her at a party months later. She was sitting on a couch talking to Bruce Willis's daughter and she waved me over. Nothing ever happened, and I never tried. It makes me happy. I could be a friendly individual she could wave and smile at across the quad. Hopefully, she felt like a normal person in those moments. I hope my friendship and not trying to fuck her or impress her could give her that. But ya, someone out there has fucked her brains out while I took my friendzone with quiet pride.
