|-| cnu4fql || 31 || well, its not 4% of my day, is it. I'm not awake for 24 hours. Say I'm awake for 16 hours, I spend 8 of those at work, and another hour getting to and from work. So we have 7 hours left of my entire day. One hour necessary to make myself dinner, so we're down to 6. 

Even if we do nothing else, an hours workout is taking up about 15% of my day. This isn't including errands I have to run at home, getting ready in the morning, work that needs doing at home, shopping etc.  |-|

|-| cnuf60z || 3 || Hey Julius,

Congrats on taking a step to improving yourself and clearing up some bad habits. I would agree with Donahue, start with 1 habit you want to break. Use that to build momentum then add another. Maybe pick the habit that seems most like a domino. For example, does alcohol after 10pm often lead to watching TV in the bedroom, sleeping late, or watching porn?

My other advice would be to pair your your bad habit with a good one. For example, no alcohol after 10pm, *and* make a to-do list every evening night for the next day.

Good luck! |-|

|-| cnuj6vc || 3 || Sounds like potentially depression, anxiety, or burn out. Consider talking to a therapist, even just for help with time management/accountability. I know one of the signs for me that I'm getting depressed is constantly feeling paralyzed and struggling with normal daily tasks like cooking/cleaning/etc.

It's not a personal failing at all, it's a brain wiring issue that is fixable with therapy and sometimes meds (although you don't sound like you're at that point to me). It's normal for most people to deal with this sometimes! You're only lazy if you acknowledge that there's a problem and then do nothing about it.

Feel free to drop me a PM if you need someone to talk to. :) |-| 
|-| cnujgk2 || 9 || I don't understand what this is saying. "Your life" refers to the time you are alive and what you experience during it. "Life" is a category of matter that meets certain criteria. He's conflating two things that are different. |-|

|-| cnul0tu || -5 || Because Louis C.K. is the guy I'm going to trust with telling me what life is all about. He's just like every other d-bag celebrity who got successful for no other reason than choosing to have no filter. It's not like his opinions or his humour are original - his whole bit is just saying things that literally everyone has already thought, but knew was stupid or had the common decency to keep to themselves. Even this quote is probably ripped off or has been said in almost the exact same way hundreds of times. |-| 
|-| cnuln5f || -4 || Yea... No.   Life to you is only you and nothing more. We are subjective to only our experience.  Louis ck can stop trying  to be a philosopher,  he's a comedian.  He's irrelevant to the progression of society  |-| 
|-| cnuluz3 || 3 || I dunno. This seems pretty bleak to me. I guess that I just generally dislike concepts that all our actions are preordained or destiny determines our lives. It makes me think that if everything we do is planned out for us where does our free will come in? It is just an illusion? Is there any purpose? That shit just bums me out. |-| 
|-| cnulxv5 || 57 || He offers a different viewpoint on what life is. Most people say "my life", and Louie is saying it's "our life." We don't own it, we take part in it. I love the quote. |-| 
|-| cnulyec || 141 || I can appreciate what he's trying to say, although it is tough to articulate... Here's something I believe that I think is pretty similar

Once you embrace that you aren't special and you aren't owed anything in life, you can deal with the bad moments more appropriately and appreciate the good moments and the hard work that goes into them more completely. |-| 
|-| cnulyf4 || 35 || a lot of hate for this quote in this thread, but its out of context. he uses it in an episode of 'louie' where hes trying to explain the selfishness/banality of suicide to his friend. out of context its a lame quote, in the show it was pretty rad |-| 
|-| cnum3pu || 4 || While I do really love this quote, it might not be that inspirational. When he used it in his show, he was trying to talk a suicidal friend of his out of it, trying to make him see the value of his life. He's saying that your life isn't just up to you, and your life is bigger than you, because of all the people who you affect.  |-|

|-| cnunn0j || 6 || Life is just life. We don't know what or where we come from. Enjoy it or not, doesn't matter. If you are miserable or happy, doesn't matter. Enjoying life is easier than being miserable, and hating it - at least it feels that way. Regardless, you all have no idea why we are.  |-| 
|-| cnunyu0 || 6 || Didn't R.E.M sing this? |-| 
|-| cnuo60g || 3 || I have do disagree. My experiences, my thoughts, my views, my feelings, my everything - it's not anybody's, it's mine. And they are what creates "my life." How else would you describe it? |-| 
|-| cnuo6gk || 7 || This is actually a better "Get Motivated" image macro than most probably think. Putting aside themes such as the cruelty of Capitalism and the inhumanity of the business world that are commonly attributed to Glengarry Glen Ross, many have suggested that the character Blake (Alec Baldwin) represents "Life" in it's most indifferent, unsympathetic embodiment. 

The thinking goes: Life doesn't care. Life couldn't give a fuck that you have a big exam tomorrow, now you have the flu. Life can't be bothered to check your calendar when it decides you haven't had a flat tire in a while. And Life certainly doesn't care that your spouse cheated on you, your mother was just diagnosed with breast cancer. The world doesn't coddle us, it is harsh and above all, uncompromising. But that doesn't mean life denies us a chance at triumph.  You can still find "success"--however you choose to define it--it just doesn't come easy and it requires you to dig deep and fight for it. 

 &amp;nbsp;

**Some excerpts from the monologue**:

 &amp;nbsp;

Blake (Baldwin): "Are they all here?"

Williamson (Spacey): "All but one."

Blake: "Well I'm going anyway."

Life doesn't wait. Time doesn't stop; it just keeps going. You have to show up or you miss out. 

 &amp;nbsp;

Blake: "Coffee is for closers only"

You don't get a free ride. If you are rewarded, it's for finishing the job. Effort is not enough, you have to "close". 

 &amp;nbsp;

Moss (Harris): "I don't gotta listen to this shit"

Blake: "You certainly don't pal"

Life won't help you along. It's perfectly happy to leave you behind. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

Levene (Lemmon): "The leads are weak."

Blake: "The leads are weak? You're weak."

You might get dealt a shitty hand. Just means you have to play that much smarter and that much harder to get where you want. 

 &amp;nbsp;

...you see where I'm going. That's only about half way through the monologue. I suggest watching the rest. It might (probably should!) make you angry. I mean, Baldwin displays practically the most callous indelicacy I can recall in a 7 minute scene.  Yet, it might be the most motivating thing you've ever heard (hopefully for the right reasons i.e. not to make as much money as possible without any regard for your fellow man).  

&amp;nbsp;

That is not to say--for clarity--that this is the only way to see the world, or even remotely the scale by which I measure my own existence. But if you're looking for motivation (and since you're reading this sub, I'll assume you are) then you might find some inspiration here. 

&amp;nbsp;

If we did not exist, life would not matter (I think, therefore I am). We create life by the simple act of *existing*. We are part of the fabric of the universe, we don't exist in a bubble separate from the life we are experiencing, we ARE the life we are experiencing.

|-| cnv10zv || 47 || I can understand the motivation part of it though I cannot agree with the concept. To truly achieve something the only person you have to prove wrong is yourself. Learn how to not give a fuck what others think and just do whatever You feel like else you might get lost in the wrong path. |-|

I do agree tho there are times when using someone else can be good for temporary motivation, but there is no longevity in this method, it just harbours bad blood |-|

He couldn't smoke for two weeks. So he pretty much just ate soup and mashed potatoes. This went on for two months and he lost 60lbs. He then decided that he liked losing weight. He said "it's nice to walk and not be in pain". Now he's about to drop under the 200 mark for the first time since I was born (23 years). I'm so proud of him. He's smoking less and less.

|-| cnxh084 || 3 || Turn your metaphor into a positive. If you can spiral down, then you can spiral up into the positive.

Self-esteem and confidence are probably the 2 things people desire most. It's time to re-evaluate all the lies we tell ourselves: I'm a quitter, I can't accomplish my goals, why should I even try, everyone else is better than me, etc. 

The lies we tell ourselves keep us down; they have no beneficial purpose.

Reframe everything into a positive:

1. I am getting better at voice acting every day that I practice more and more.

2. By working out I am gradually becoming healthier because exercise is a wonderfully productive habit. I take care of my body every day so I can reap the benefits of a longer, happier life.

I was just feeling good that I had finally lost some weight, nothing close to what I need to lose to but seeing results were uplifting. When I posted I expected some good and bad but nothing close to what I received. My original post was negative, and then someone else posted it over at shitpost where it received even more negativity. Lastly I saw it get reposted over at fatpeoplehate where it received an increasing amount of negativity. 
To all the people who said I was gross and a fat fuck, I agree, that's why I'm working on not being a fat fuck. 
To everyone who said nice things, thank you, it helped even the scales a bit.
Overall, I'm glad I could create such a well received clusterfuck. I'll see you all again when I'm down 50 more pounds. Oops, I meant 100 pounds, spelled that wrong.

Would you mind if I posted this in one of my weekly motivational newsletters? We send a motivational email every Monday morning to a group of aspiring entrepreneurs to encourage them to achieve their goals and kick ass.

I think a post about the time and commitment that went into achieving your skills, combined with the message, could be inspiring : )

Newsletter is here if you're interested btw: http://mondaymotivation.instapage.com

Keep up the baller work. |-| 
|-| cob1duf || 3 || This reminds me of something my wife told me soon after we met (15 years ago today incidentally) that's stayed with me ever since; "Your parents are responsible for your birth, not your life". It really made me wake up and start being the author of my own destiny. |-| 
|-| coavn0r || 7 || I'm with OP on this one. It varies from person to person. Be happy, period! Screw everyone else's standards. One of my closest drinking buddies stopped talking to me because I quit drinking. I guess that's why he was just that a buddy, not a friend. I'm trying to better myself everyday because it makes me happy. You can't make someone else happy until you're happy. I'm more of a loner who loves his books anyway but that might not be everyones case. Being yourself, to me, is most important. I rock a ponytail as well, I will sell my hair at the end of the year and donate the cash to a charity. Love to me is also extremely important, love for whatever passions anyone might have. Love for family, true friends, your favorite hobbies. I've been around the world twice and have seen many cultures and lived in harmony with cultures we have invaded. My love for myself and not giving two fucks what anyone has thought of me has made me happy. Redditors could bash me everyday, and if I wasn't welcome here I just wouldn't post. Be yourself! Love yourself! This is my opinion, if no one else likes it, it's ok, no one has to but me. Smile more too, for fucks sake smile. I've seen how it can change a persons day because I've seen it change mine. |-|

|-| cobevx2 || 4 || /r/stopdrinking helped me get, and stay, sober. A brilliant community and my subreddit of choice on the matter. I'm more on the 'rampant alcoholic' end of the spectrum, but if you have made the realisation that the best way to stop these awful things from happening is simply not to drink, then you are a very perceptive and empowered human being. All the best! |-| 
|-| cobew1o || 4 || Hey man,

When I turned 18 I would party every single weekend. Sure, every now and then I had an awesome time.. But for the most part I was just throwing my money away and my health was deteriorating due to my excessive drinking.

Enough was enough. I didn't want that shit anymore. I got myself a gym membership at the
Age of 20 and for the past few months I've put my headphones in and smashed out a decent workout a few times a week. I can't even put into words how much better I feel. The fact that alcohol is a depressant and working out releases endorphins just makes that line even clearer of where I want to be. I have more energy, feel better, look better and I have more money!

|-| cogjakk || 3 || How to have a good work day: Have a great job! |-| 
|-| cogk3t2 || 3 || I work eight hours straight non stop. I don't even look at my phone or respond to text messages (unless I'm driving. yes, I know) Lunch is about 5 minutes of me eating as fast as possible. The most breaking I'll do is when I say "I'm tired of doing task X, let me switch to task y (which involves walking to a different location - that's the break time)". I don't even go to the bathroom at work unless my bladder or colon is about to explode.

I'm the boss btw.

When I get home. That's it. No more work. I don't even think about it. The rest of the day is mine. I'm not stressed in the least. |-|
