hyuck hyuck hyuck hyuck |-| 
|-| co906sa || 35 || Now get sanding ;) |-| 
|-| co905or || 8 || Good going. The highways and cut-away views of things, the overhead views of urban settings, are imho far and away the strongest in this set. I hope to see more. Got a website? Best of luck to you. |-| 
|-| co99ige || 15 || It's really hard for me to look at your work objectively; after all those years of model-building in architecture school I can't really see your carved buildings without thinking, "this would be so much neater made out of pieces of basswood/cut using a bandsaw and sanded, etc" But others are right- there is something very appealing about the roughness of your work when you view it from the perspective of fine art. It is the most apparent in your parkette piece, which seems like a wonderful form created by this intuitive hand-carving process you have, exploring the shape made by the intersection of a grove of trees.

If making cityscapes makes you happy, then keep doing it. There are better ways to achieve perfectly regular street edges and so on with far less work than hand-carving; perhaps google some architectural context model photos if you want to see examples. If you want to explore forms that are best carved by hand, keep looking for more examples like the trees. I think the rough texture of the ground plane of your "overpass" piece is also a good example of this. (For me, the streets are just off orthogonal enough to hit my architectural-intolerance-of-irregularity nerve, but the landscape is wonderful). 

I hope this is helpful, and good luck developing your artistic skills!  |-|

 |-| 
|-| co907e5 || 21 || I found the road systems to be the most compelling aesthetically from that group. They are highly original and very decorative. Do you plan to focus more on those? I would 100% purcahse one if they were available. |-|

|-| co92i9b || 4 || The Google Earth view piece has potential if its part of a set that shows maybe a small city.. I bet some small city council building would love to have that shit on their wall. |-| 
|-| co913lk || 28 || I'm no artist, and I'm no woodworker.

I think you need better tools and nicer wood.

edit: word |-| 
|-| co907d3 || 7 || Great work! You really have a lot of talent with carving! I have one piece of criticism though; it looks like you could take just a little more work in the end to give it a nicer finish. With the trees, the grass has a great texture but the trees still look rough. I love how the first carving looks, but you can still see the pencil marks. You might try sanding lightly and possibly staining?  |-| 
|-| co8xb0s || 3 || This is really cool!

I do feel sorry for artists in general as landlords and businesses feel they can just rent an open, ratty, space and not care about upkeep for artists when compared to other tenants.  |-| 
|-| co8up1i || 3 || Do you know what it is you want to achieve? Your own words are very mean and punishing, the approach to yourself seems more problematic than your art.  |-| 
|-| cob4qrj || 37 || Ironically, they are both starving in way as the high calorie but low nutrient food fatty is eating allows for someone to have an appetite long after caloric needs are met.  Despite being superobese, people often remain malnourished.  This fits nicely into the out of balance and disharmonious yin/yang artistic concept.   |-| 
|-| cob20ef || 615 || The amount of food that a westerner eats has no bearing on starvation in undeveloped countries. There is more than enough food being produced to feed everyone, but in war-torn or otherwise unstable areas, distribution networks break down. |-| 
|-| cob6lpr || 40 || This reminds me of my last flight on Delta. |-| 
|-| cobek6c || 27 || For me as an African the problem is not the money that comes in to Africa and is wasted but the money that leaves Africa to developed countries. This includes but is not limited to corruption money, foreign debt obligations (some paid multiple times over), stolen resources, and resources bought but do not fully compensate the owners (e.g. cocoa among others). The art shows that some people consume far more than the other and in a closed system the only way for the disadvantaged party to be better off is to take some from those who have excess. It may not be a realistic scenario but it does show there is a definite imbalance. 

Africa makes a lot of mistakes and we are beginning to rectify some of them but there are some things that make it impossible to compete on the world stage and those things are out of our control. A good example is tied aid. Tied aid may help a poor country build a piece of infrastructure but it is done at far higher costs because the government is required to source materials from relatively higher cost supplies e.g the provider of the loan or some other party. Another example is foreign loans that make the home government to open access to its economy to the loan giver by removing protectionist measures e.g tariffs, subsidies etc when the country giving the loan heavily subsidies their own industries. America for example heavily subsidies agriculture making the price of its rice, corn etc  artificially low. When these goods are sent to be sold to lets say Zimbabwe they are far cheaper for locals to buy that buying locally produced varieties. You may say this is good for the consumers and it is but considering that somewhere close to 40 to 60% of the population are farmers their ability to get a good price and to make a good enough living is diminished. 

You may say that it's the fault of the local governments for accepting these agreements and to a large extent it is but poor people do not have a luxury of choice. It is quite literally take the money and starve a bit or don't take the money and starve outright. 

But coming back to the picture, i get a very ominous feeling looking at it. It may not be obvious to outsiders what is happening to africa but bulkanisation of regions is the new movement. East africa is moving steadily towards economic integration and ultimately a political one. Such movements are welcomed and maybe one day we'll be able to say to other peoples that the price of our shit has gone up.  |-| 
|-| cob1akf || 384 || I gst what the artist is trying for here. But it's a bullshit idea. Fat westerners arent stopping the starving third world from eating well. There is enough food produced globally to feed everyone. Distribution is what's at issue. And crazy people telling the third worl that GMOs are somehow bad. 

Edit: I didn't mean to send this into a political debate. But I guess political art does that on its own.  |-|

|-| cob666v || 74 || /r/im14andthisisdeep |-| 
|-| cobe8v5 || 15 || I have to say, I don't think the artist is explicitly stating that westerners eating habits have any bearing on the starvation in undeveloped countries. I think it's more just commenting on the contrast between situations, without actually pointing any fingers or blaming anyone. Alot of people here seem to be getting offended based on their own interpretation of the art it seems.  |-| 
|-| cob5y93 || 42 || Looks like one just has bigger bones. |-| 
|-| cob9c8h || 14 || Many comments in this thread are *incredibly* stupid. Like, shit man. |-| 
|-| cobhsp6 || 4 || I love it. Unfortunately it is the governments of impoverished countries that deflect aid to the hungry. That is why I do what I can locally contributing monthly to my local food shelf and a local homeless shelter. There is by far enough food to feed the hungry, but governments don't let it get through to some locales.  |-| 
|-| cobkyzo || 4 || Incorrect usage of Yin and Yang... Oh well!  |-| 
|-| cob813r || 21 || first i'm no artist or political analyst, i'm just a random asshole on the internet. 

That said, a yin yang is suppose to represent duality. So using it to represent global starvation (especially the black and white nature of it). Shows this person either has no understanding of global hunger, because there are far more Asians starving (India is still part of Asia right?) than Africans, or this person is trying to be ironic (which I doubt, because this is a bit *too* ironic). 

Obesity is a big problem. As a former EMS/Firefighter volunteer I have seen my fair share of it, in the small minute spec of a town that I live in that is hardly representative of the US. So using a little logic I would say, yes, there is quite a bit of obesity here. However, there is hunger and starvation here too. Which leads me to believe it isn't a bunch of fat people stealing all the food from the starving ones. Hell it's not always the poor that are starving ironically (but that's a whole other subject). 

What they should have drawn was a scale. on one side of the scale a fat western political figure shunning terrorism and war in the middle east, and on the other side which is raised up because it means so little should be the starving Africans surrounded by militants etc. Both causes for war but only one being fought for money.

my under-educated rant is over |-| 
|-| cob68ss || 16 || It's funny how people are getting hung up on the "well there's enough food produced it's just not getting there."

No fucking shit.  That's the point. |-| 
|-| cob18e8 || 77 || This can be taken as racist. |-| 
|-| cobmlqe || 3 || Sort of, but it seems to imply that race plays a part here, and not banks. It's a false and easy dichotomy, and not representative of the cause of inequality at all...  |-| 
|-| cobmvf3 || 3 || It's not that black and white |-| 
|-| cobqemu || 3 || I don't know if its fair to characterize the west as being white. It just undermines all the other races that live here. |-| 
|-| cobtkjn || 3 || Another thing to consider is that in America, a higher percentage of the black population is obese than in the white population.  |-| 
|-| cobu8ib || 3 || I took the image as more of an abstract look at the way humans content themselves to spend their days in opulent self-indulgence despite being aware of the many others around the world suffering and dying from a lack of the very things that we take for granted. |-| 
|-| cob7zs1 || 7 || I think most people are missing the point here.  A yin-yang is a representation of an interconnected balance.  There is NO balance if on one hand people can be negligently wasteful and on the other hand children are dying from starvation. |-| 
|-| cobfg2h || 5 || ITT: silly africans check your thin privilege  |-| 
|-| cobkkaj || 5 || The same people who create images like this are also the same people who fight against advancements like Golden Rice.

|-| cobemo9 || 3 || Racist stereotype of bald people will not stand. |-| 
|-| cob21ul || 6 || To everyone speaking only of obesity and girth - remember that artists try not to be so blatant about their message. The unhealthy size of the white side perhaps represents the larger portion of wealth.

Of course the remote and pizza slice do not help my argument at all. If this is a statement on obesity it is not only a very simple piece but also not stating a real truth (there is plenty of food around - we are just not distributing/growing it properly).  |-|

It's a series of definitions. Basically, they're using the symbols "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9," but their values are defined by these statements, so they're not the numbers defined by 1 + 1 = 2, 2 + 1 = 3, etc.

We have nine equations with nine unknowns and no actual numbers (actual 1,2,3,etc) involved, so it cannot be absolutely solved, but every unknown can be defined in relation to one of the unknowns if these equations are all linearly independent, so we can have an easy way of finding solutions. We can put all of these equations into one big matrix:

2 	 0 	 -1 	 0 	 0 	 0 	 0 	 0 	 0 :	 0

Each row is an equation, and each column represents a different variable. Column one is "1", Column two is "2", and so on. Column 10 would normally be an actual number, and because we lack an actual number to reference these unknowns to, we won't have one unique solution, but rather an infinite amount of solutions along a 9 dimensional line.

Note that summing the part of the equation before the : gives the value after the :, so in row one, 2 * "1" - "3" = 0, which is the equation "1" + "1" = "3" rewritten.

Some quick matrix shenanigans gives the matrix

 0 	 0 	 0 	 0 	 0 	 0 	 1 	 0 	 3 	: 0

 0 	 0 	 0 	 0 	 0 	 0 	 0 	 1 	 -1/2 : 0

Row one here states that "1" - 7/4 * "9" = 0, which can be rewritten as "1" = 7/4 * "9". We can rearrange all of the equations like this, and at the end set "9" equal to a variable t, so that a solution set is equal to a function of t.

"1" = 7/4 * t 

"2" = -13/4 * t 

"3" = 7/2 * t 

"4" = -5/2 * t 

"5" = -5 * t 

"6" = 1/4 * t 

"7" = -3 * t 

"8" = 1/2 * t 

"9" = t

You can set any number to t and have a go at it, all of the definitions will hold. If you want to get every number to be a whole number, you would set t to 4, and end up with

"1" = 7

"2" = -13

"3" = 14

"4" = -10

"5" = -20

"6" = 1

"7" = -12

"8" = 2

"9" = 4

Neat. There are infinite solutions to this (t can be any value), but this is the simplest whole number solution.

tl;dr: These aren't the numbers 1,2,3,etc. They are those symbols, but they have different numerical values. The last string of equations I give will work in all of the equations. |-|

|-| cobqpoc || 3 || As I see it, it's a commentary on empiricism. It's saying that numbers in themselves don't mean anything, that their value is manufactured by human endeavors. You look at it, and you viscerally react to it being WRONG, but those are just scribbles on a canvas that typically represent an abstract concept. Art is the making of meaning, and the artist intentionally plays with the meaning of Arabic numerals to question the ingrained idea that empirical observation necessarily equals fact. 

Or some guy is bad at math.  |-|
