Having water in them is almost certain as water is one of the smallest molecules that is liquid at "reasonable" temperatures for life.  Since it is such a small molecule it can pass through membranes and facilitate the movement of other stuff through cells.  Carbon is also very likely needed for life since its elemental charectoristics allow it to form a vast number of complex molecules.  Silicon could also do this but not nearly as well and silicon is far rarer then carbon.   The commonness of the stuff that makes life on earth is also a good indicator that there is a good chance thats what other life is made of.  If the most common stuff is also the best at doing what we think life requires why would it be reasonable to think other life was made of rarer stuff? |-|

Lots of organisms don't need sunlight -- that isn't strict criteria. However, we do know that sunlight is one of the most dramatic sources of energy available to a surface ecosystem, which is going to have a large effect on local chemistry and so we figure it may be required to kickstart the process. It's this local chemistry that produces energy for life, not the sunlight directly.

We usually target organic molecules and associated metabolites: ammonia, methane, carbon dioxide, to list a few. We aren't expecting life to form from "dangerous" energy, as there really aren't many forms of dangerous energy. The only one is nuclear, and it is generally thought that it doesn't release energy on the right timescale for biology to use it as a power source. |-|

1. All swans I've seen are white.
2. I've never seen a swan of another colour.
3. Therefore all swans are white.

The problem of induction is that you can't be sure that 3. is correct, because I haven't seen every swan ever. So the problem is that you can't produce absolute certain knowledge from just a set of observations. But this is how we get most of our "knowledge."

|-| cnty6sa || 3 || As someone currently studying this in minnows it can caused by many things. As people have said, floods are a common cause. A common original cause for high latitudes (northern us and canada) is the melting of glaciers and Continental ice thousands of years ago creating large flooding and often glacial lakes. These fish have been known to spread apart and make new species. Fish also majorly spread through tributaries, rivers and streams that feed into lakes. If you look on a map of most natural lakes there is often, or at least was at some point, a river or stream feeding it. Some of these are very small and very shallow creeks that connect lakes and rivers. They would be too small for a grown large predator, pike, largemouth or striped bass, etc. Their fry, or babies, are very small and can move great distances after about two weeks from hatching. Many fish lay up to a few thousand eggs. Most of them don't survive but there is still a potential of have a few hundred from each fish in a stream that are traveling in any direction. Once fry get into a lake they may mature and become stuck in the lake reproducing there.  |-|

|-| cntytdj || 3 || I asked this exact question 17 days ago... [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2r3y1e/why_are_some_fish_species_so_widespread_despite/)

Anyways, based on those responses and some further research, lakes are considerably more connected that we think.  Though a given lake may currently be completely isolated and have no connecting streams, it is likely that they were at some point in the last couple million years.  For example, it may be difficult to see how northern pike in a lake in west-central Minnesota could spread to a lake in northern Manitoba, but 13,000 years ago, they were connected by glacial lake [Agassiz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Agassiz).  Northerns have been around for approximately 60 million years, which is plenty of time to explain their far reaching continental expansion.  

How they spread to other continents is much more baffling.  The current leading hypothesis is that they spread from North America to Asia via the marshy areas of the land bridge that connected the two. The [Bering Land Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringia) has been present at least twice since northern pike have been around, and since it was likely marshy and northerns are good colonizers it is certainly possible that they spread to Asia via it.  (special thanks to u/iyuaeo for this response).

Additionally, manufacturers of at least 3 major components included in every lenovo laptop have had "major security exploits" or backdoors discovered within the last 10 years.  

So, short of grabbing my tinfoil hat and standing on a soap box.. is there any way I can reasonably convince anyone that China is already "very much" spying on the rest of the world, and quite possibly, in space as well?  

I had a really good conversation with an engineer from Cisco who told me that while our equipment's efficient has improved dramatically over the years, suspiciously the packet transfer success rate is not in line with that.  His theory is that the HUGE increase in digital spying accounts for the network "jitter" and packet failure rate.  He also went on to theorize how creating a "noisy" environment and causing a lot of packet failures is a strategy used by snoops, because when it's consistent, engineers consider it "normal" and raise thresholds and error correction, essentially helping out anyone trying to intentionally "mess" with these packets.. when the "noise" goes away, the number of packets they can steal goes up infinitely.

|-| cnu7kkm || 4 || I did some asylum work for a couple summers in law school. What /u/ACrusaderA said covers most of it, but I can give a little more detail from the a US perspective (except that I think the poster uses asylee and refugee interchangably. An asylee is basically a refugee that is already in the country where they want to stay. A refugee, on the other hand, gets status as a refugee *before* they come to the country where they are seeking protection. Maybe the distinction doesn't matter in Canada, but if you're in the US you can't apply for refugee status since you're already in the country).

To get asylum in the US you have to show that you have a well-founded fear of persecution if you are returned to your home country. If you can show that you have been persecuted in the past, then it is assumed your fear of persecution is well-founded and the government has to show that it's no longer well-founded to keep you from getting asylum. If you haven't been persecuted in the past the burden is on the applicant to prove their fear of persecution is well-founded.

There are some other caveats as well. If the persecuting group is not the government, you have to show that the government is unable or unwilling to control that group. So if you're a Jew and get beat up by skinheads in France, you were technically persecuted by a nongovernmental group, but couldn't get asylum because the French government can control skinheads. However, if the NGO is localized, the government can still deny you asylum if you can move within your country to a safer place. For example, there are places in Mexico where it is dangerous to be transgender. The government doesn't persecute you, but it can't control gangs who do. However, you may be able to move to Mexico City and be just fine. In that case, you wouldn't get asylum since you can relocate to safety within your own country. Of course if the government is doing the persecuting, there's no relocating.

As for proof, usually it's testimonial. We don't expect asylum seekers to be able to bring much with them. A government officer hears their story and decides if the person is credible or not. The credibility determination is huge and probably the biggest hurdle. It's also the most subjective, which is problematic, especially when dealing with other cultures (for example, avoiding eye contact is seen as shift in the US, but it might be a sign of respect in other countries). There is some objectivity to it, though. If the asylum seeker has documents, they can show those to the court. The court also considers human rights reports on the country in question, especially US State Department reports, and compares those to the story of the asylum seeker to see if they're consistent. Nonetheless, the rates at which asylum is granted vary greatly by judge, even when those judges are in the same building hearing the same cases (there are stats on this I can dig up if you're interested).

Also an interesting side note, Mexico, the US, and Canada have a treaty whereby if you seek asylum in one of those three countries, you can't seek it the other two (sometimes if you are rejected from one country, you can seek asylum from another country).

There's also something called the Convention Against Torture, which prevents the US from returning any person to a country where they will likely be tortured. Torture is a higher bar to show than persecution, but you don't have to deal with a lot of other stuff (like showing the persecution was based on race, religion, sex, etc.).  |-|

|-| cnu89tp || 5 || Part of the answer is surely that his actions don't seem so terrible to a young revolutionary minded person. But also I think that early on when western college groups latched onto him as a symbol, they mostly just had access to favorable and autobiographical writings. A lot of the negative versions of his actions were written later in response to him becoming this sympathetic figure. So it's a bit of chicken and egg there. |-| 
|-| cnu8tlc || 19 || Because somebody created a really iconic image of him, and that image became the predominant understanding a lot of people had of him. Che Guevara the brand became more "real" and went a lot further than Che Guevara the person.

Also, revolutionaries in general tend to involve terrible actions. That's the reality of war. The extent to which a person is connected to his or her atrocities after the fact depends greatly on who writes the history books and whose stories get included. History is full of revolutionaries whom history glorifies and glosses over their death toll and presents it as "justified" or "necessary" or "a bad thing, but that was the way things were back then. we're better now." And some get more of this than others. If we actually exercised a "no death toll" policy for our admired historical figures, the list of people we were taught to admire would be much, much shorter.

An early or untimely death can also adjust things in someone's favor, as they become memorialized as the person they were then, with no competition from the person they would have become, and as they themselves no longer present a threat to anyone, they might be given a bit more leeway to be seen as heroes now that they're safely dead. Martyrdom, as well, has an effect in that direction.

Che Guevara had/has all of those things going for him to become a symbol: early death, an unfinished mission that enables people to think in terms of what he "could have" accomplished rather than any reality in which he might have done poorly or failed, the list of terrible actions being perforce shortened by his not getting around to any of the ones that would've been after his death, his adversaries being less inclined to spend resources discrediting a dead man than they would be toward a live one that's still an active threat to them, his potential allies and supporters and fence-sitters being more inclined to be charitable once he's no longer a live potential liability who might in the future express inconvenient views or become too powerful for comfort, it's easy to cherry-pick bits and pieces of his life's work or his views to support all sorts of other, vaguely-related causes, the people who formed the bulk of his casualties weren't valued sufficiently by the rest of the world to arouse widespread condemnation, and he's got that iconic picture that makes him look like the patron saint of freedom. |-| 
|-| cnu93nl || 8 || Your brain builds a 3-D model of a scene from visual cues. Some of those cues are based on where the lenses of your eyes focus to make a clear image, some are based on the divergence of angle of your eyes, some of them are based on how hazy or blurry parts of the image are, and some of them are based on occlusion — of objects passing in front of other objects.

Split depth gifs insert two whitespaces into the picture, and parts of the picture are occluded by the whitespace, and parts of the picture occlude some of the rest of the whitespace. 

These cues provide just enough information to your brain to tick it over from "I am seeing a two-dimensional image" to "I am seeing a three-dimensional image at moderately close distance", and your brain builds a 3D model of the scene, which you experience.

You have to make your own opinion by looking at some facts.  He was born in an upper middle class family, and was on his way to becoming a medical doctor. Had he stayed in Argentina, he would most likely have had a very comfortable life. He is respected in Latin America, because the perception is that he left the comfort of his life, to fight along the poor, against the brutal American backed regimes that plagued the continent at that time.  America's fear of Communism, forced them to prop various brutal regimes, and the idea was to first free Cuba, and continue to various other countries in Latin America. That is why, eventually, the CIA got him in Bolivia. Don't forget that rule #1 of a revolution is to KILL all representatives of the previous regime, to ensure they don't come back. This is how the French Royal family, and the Russian Royal family disappeared from existence, they killed even babies to ensure the bloodlines ended.

Being able to deliver payloads to the ISS from the launch pads of both space agencies means that it has a kind of funky orbital inclination.

The cost of the extra shuttle missions dwarfs Russia's fairly modest financial contribution to the ISS.

What US/Russian cooperation **did** do for the US was create jobs for all these really smart and capable Russian rocket scientists that involved building a cool space station rather than designing a bunch of next generation super-missiles for fucking North Korea or whoever.

It's very much like how if you have a sheet of paper you can fit more words on it if you write smaller.  There's no reason to fully halve your writing size to double the amount of information.

With Flash memory each individual bit (or pair of bits, for MLC) is stored in a little structure that is constructed (a flash cell).  The designers took that design, copy/pasted it, then added a bit of control circuitry to select between the two cells.  Then you take *that* design, copy/paste it, and add a bit of control circuitry to select between the pairs of cells.  Repeat, repeat, repeat, etc, etc, etc, until you have a single chip that can hold a large power of two bytes.

Eventually your technology gets better, so you take your old chip design (at least the memory portions of it), copy/paste it, and add one more layer of control circuitry to select between the two halves of the chip.  Now you have a chip with twice the memory.

It's this fundamental difference between making each individual flash cell versus making a big blank slate and physically filling it up which causes the difference between storage size changes.  |-|

When it's very cold out, the air is usually dry as well, and the nose is really working overtime to add some fluid.

Iran used to be a absolute-ish monarchy, under control of the Shah, a term similar to emperor. The Shah ruled what is now Iran for centuries. He used to be a puppet ruler like in current monarchies until in 1953 they told then-prime minster Mossadegh to fuck off. This was the first event. Now we come to the 1970s, With Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in power. Remember, this is the Cold War, so, lots of comunnist/capitalist struggles for power in 3rd world countries, and Iran was one of them.

So Reza Pahlavi was Pro-US all the way, and under his command Iran started a sort of westernization process in which a lot of social, political, and economical aspects changed, and (in the same way that other 3rd world countries managed this) oppressed anyone that didn't agree with their policies. Now add corruption and excessive use of force (they had a secret police, SAVAK, that worked in a similar way that of the german stasi, or the chilean CNI). You can see where this is going.

This is when shit starts hitting the fan. The (sometimes forceful) introduction of american culture to Iran caused a sort of clash between it and islamic Culture. Muslims are pissed. Protests started popping in urban centers all over the country and ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (which is in exile) as the islamic leader. Shit happens (lots of conflict here, too much for a reddit comment) and in Februrary 3, 1979 the Shah flees, never to return again. An islamic republic was installed and Khomeini (who returned to Iran) is declared the supreme religious leader. Welcome to modern day Iran.

Now ISIS, damn.

This has nothing to do with the Iranian Revolution (at least not too much) but its roots can be traced to the insurgencies in the middle east, mostly in Al-Qaeda and the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan. When ISIS was formed, back in the early 2000s it started as a branch (cell) of Al-Qaeda that had the main objective to turn the mostly westerized middle east countries into a radical Sunni islamic state (the hardcore ones, Sharia and whatever), establishing a "worldwide caliphate (islamic kingdom)" in the muslim world. This is the part where you could make a connection with the Iranian Revolution (say no to the west, say yes to islam) but the objectives and execution of the plan is VERY different (cue beheadings and mass murders, although during the IR this was also practiced, the radicality of ISIS plays a role in making it more brutal). Now ISIS is in sort of an arm-wrestling match with Iraq and Syria for territories to enforce te islamic laws and radical islam and whatever. This is the present.

DISCLAIMER: since this happened within 50 years of the present time, it's difficult to say completely objective things about this events, especially since ISIS is still a Thing.

DISCLAMIER II: this has been MASSIVELY oversimplified but is what I found best suited for ELI5.

You know how, when you put your hand in really hot water, you pull away real fast cause it felt super hot? It's cause water is really good at making things super hot or super cold really fast. Our noses do this too.

If your lips get too dry, sometimes it can crack and hurt a lot, right? We really don't want that to happen inside us, so we have to keep our insides wet.

When it's really cold out, the water in our noses run out really quickly. This is no good, so our noses decide to make a ton more!

This is great, lots of wetness, but it's a little too great, which gets bad. There's no rulers or measuring clocks in our noses. Once it gets started, it works too hard. Now we have all this water overflowing, like when we pour too much water in the sink and it goes over the sides.

That's your runny nose. |-|

Browsers try to prevent a lot of refreshing and shifting of elements as it loads because that can be visually disturbing and frustrating for a user--although you tend to see some of that anyway. Also, sometimes the browser simply cannot know where to place elements until it knows the relative sizes of everything.

So this means that if an element "hangs" on loading, the browser doesn't display a page, or displays a mostly incomplete page while it waits. If you do something to halt that loading, the browser just gives up and treats that element as nonexistent and renders accordingly. |-|

The problem with cheap restaurant bacon is that they have big griddles and are more concerned with prep time (and other factors) than getting the bacon cooked exactly right - crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. So it's sliced too thin, then cooked too hot and too fast. But it's still bacon and a lot of people don't care, don't know any better, or both.

Bacon takes a surprisingly long time to cook well. |-|

There's bacon salt, bacon mayonnaise, bacon flavored gum, chocolate covered bacon, maple bacon milkshakes, bacon wrapped everything, bacon print ties, etc. Because of the recent obsession with it, the price has gone up to the point where it's one of the most expensive meats at the store after steak and fish. It's $6 a pound here in NC, one of the biggest pork producing states in the country, whereas chicken breast is $3.50, chicken thighs are $2.50, lean hamburger is $4.50 and even pork tenderloin is $5.20.

Anyway, I'm one of the people you think doesn't exist. I prefer pork to beef or chicken. I like bacon, but it's not my favorite pork. That would be pork tenderloin cooked on the grill. I wish the bacon craze would die down so I could actually afford it occasionally. I refuse to pay $6/lb of 50% fat bacon when I can get a tenderloin for less. |-|

Don't you think local communities know how to better address the needs of their students as opposed to bureaucrats in Washington? This whole one-size fits all approach is good in theory, but it just does not hold true in practice. Education is too complex of an issue for the federal government to have the ability to resolve. Every student has different needs and comes from a different background, but now there will be become even less room for teachers to be innovate in the classroom. For example, a student from San Jose, CA might have different needs a student from rural Mississippi. Not to mention of course that the program comes with a hefty price tag for taxpayers who had no say in the matter.  |-|

Notice how capacity is actually 7.42gb, not 8gb. It's close enough so manufacturers call it 8gb. The same goes with Hard Drives.

|-| cnuq3gr || 26 || Sorry if it's too simple an answer, but it's because parents don't understand it and therefore assume it's not working. 

I heard bad things about it, but then I tutored my neighbor's grandson (first grade). Honestly, it seemed smart and well planned as far as the students went. There was some random bullshit here and there, but the goal at least at the first grade level was to connect everything and instill this sense of continuity in learning. It was quite cool to see them combine elements of math and English, for example, to lead to a more rounded skill set in students, rather than a definitive line of many students liking one thing and hating another. I picked up on what each thing would be trying to teach fairly quickly (in math, they taught you the relationship between numbers, how to represent them different ways, etc.), but my neighbor couldn't because she was used to her upbringing. 

The failure of the common core, at least for this school district, seemed to be that the teachers couldn't adequately incorporate the parents into the mix. They were able to teach the students just fine, but getting the parents to understand what was going on was a mess. Had they sent simple explanation worksheets or something it should be been fine.  |-|

|-| cnuq7o9 || 16 || For starters it's not a curriculum, it's a set of standards. This misunderstanding is probably one of the main reasons people seem to hate it. They think that common core is telling teachers what and how to teach, which is a curriculum. Common Core lets teachers and school teach however they want, but students must know certain things by certain grade levels so that kids from across the nation have equal opportunities regardless of the school they went to.

Another major reason people dislike it is that they see new ways of teaching which they haven't learned, so they don't understand their children's homework. Instead of learning the new ways(which aren't directly related to CC), they complain that CC is too complicated and they should stick to the old ways of teaching(Again this is partly because of the misconception that CC is a curriculum). This is completely opposite of what education is supposed to be, which is being exposed to new ideas and information.

What you need to know about CC is this: Some very smart people got together and looked at the current education system in the US. They realized it sucks and in an attempt to make it better they created a set of standards that all schools/students should be held to. This is to both better the over education of the country as well as to given students from different parts of the country an even playing field when it comes to college/job applications. Now these people are currently trying to get these standards accepted in various states. |-|

 |-| 
|-| cnuqr0l || 13 || One big reason is the presentation.

My extended family is involved in education, and I've actually read the common core standards as they are adopted in my state. Actually reading the thing is more than most people have done. I suggest you do the same.

In one setting the standards of the common core are treated as the bare minimum. That is, the standard enumerates what a student in a remedial course needs to understand in order to pass to the next year's class. It is a D- or C or whatever the minimum passing score is for the remedial class.

In another setting the standards of the common core are treated as the gold standard for the grade. They are the ideal target, students who meet them should get an "A".

Another big reason is how the standards are being used.

In some settings they are being used as the guide for the teaching curriculum. Established, high quality, effective textbooks are being thrown out, and replaced with quickly-written books with little to no content.  

I wrote up about it when [I found out my child's textbooks were being replaced with garbage books.](http://bryanwagstaff.com/index.php/textbook-selection-committee-should-be-fired-then-re-hired-and-fired-again/) They had wonderful textbooks full of examples and useful teaching guides. The new textbooks (which proudly proclaim on every page that they are "common core") have zero instructional material.

The end result of my own investigation is that the district gave us copies of the older books up through calculus, so we can at least have copies of actual instructional material in case we need it.

So that's my take on why it is so bad:  One group says "This is the minimum standard!" Another group -- which included the school boards and the textbook selection committee -- interpreted it as the curriculum to be followed, in that specific order, and taught as the ideal goal. |-|

In general, I would assume that when you take control of the server the provider includes a clause saying that if your machine does anything illegal (in their jurisdiction) you're accountable for it, just as if you owned it.

The question becomes wether or not you could shift that responsibility onto the Twitch users which actually instructed the machine to do the illegal thing. And you'd probably have trouble doing this. You and the players both have agreements with twitch but don't have a formal agreement with each other, so passing liability that way becomes difficult. |-|

|-| cnurkx5 || 4 || SpaceX is basically a government contractor, but there are two differences between SpaceX and contractors like Lockheed Martin or Boeing. 

1. SpaceX doesn't just manufacture parts, it runs the launches and manufactures and designs everything on their own. Essentially NASA pays SpaceX to go do something it wants, and SpaceX manages the whole thing  mostly themselves. There are some other places which do this but SpaceX is the biggest.

2. SpaceX is very tightly controlled, it is privately traded not publicly, and Elon Musk actually has a very large degree of control over it. One of the odd things about this is that it really does seem like they have the goal of just expanding without much concern for profit, they are trying to grow instead of find a successful niche. 

What these two things combined together basically mean is that SpaceX isn't really innovative, just very efficient. SpaceX is in many ways the ideal government contractor, it requires little oversight, it won't try to rip you off or have cost overruns, and it is tightly managed making communication easy. Here is where things get weird though, there's another side to SpaceX, the media. Elon Musk has a big media presence and so does SpaceX, by contracting with SpaceX, NASA is basically proving to budget hawks and conservatives that they are working with private industry, that improves their political standing and help secure more allies and funding. 

That is what SpaceX is, what it is trying to do is somewhat different.

Elon Musk is basically trying to have his own truly exploratory space program. This idea has seeped into all of SpaceX and is part of what makes them so driven and effective, there is a definite cult of personality there surrounding Musk, and the level of reverence from people who work there can kind of get creepy sometimes, but just a little. In any case it means that the company follows him in his vision, they see themselves as on the frontier of exploring all of space. In fact because of this the people I have met there are often very touchy about the fact that they would be nothing without NASA, they see themselves as independent and a driving force in space exploration.

Is SpaceX going to get to Mars? No. Just no, they don't have the money and no one will pay them to do that. Barring something crazy the first people on Mars will be wearing NASA patches, but this isn't to say that SpaceX isn't doing something cool. While the goal of SpaceX is exploration, in reality it has been really effective at simply improving the way we do things in orbit, its reusable technology has some promise, and the efficient way the operation is run has been a great way to reduce costs, they are starting to open up earth orbit for real private expansion, and that is a big development. 

The fact remains that exploring the universe and seeing beyond humanities next horizon is going to be done on the government's dime, and frankly I can't see that changing ever, certainly not soon. But opening up the more common parts of space to private development is a rare opportunity that is good for business and humanity, and SpaceX is leading that. |-|

|-| cnuskte || 3 || First point to make is that hard drives for marketing reasons will use metric prefixes for their advertised capacities instead of binary ones (GB refers to 1000 MB, not 1024).  There is a 'new' [IEC standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix) for referring to binary capacities by modified names including the the letters 'bi' for binary.  Kilobyte becomes Kibibyte, Gigabyte becomes Gibibyte, and so on.

One additional point: often the space on a hard drive will be an approximation rather than an exact amount.

For example, I have a 1TB HDD here that is populated with a single NTFS volume.  If I go into my device manager and look at the capacity, it tells me that I have 953869 MB with 9 MB of unallocated space.  In this case, the computer is using binary prefixes.

That is, a binary Megabyte (Mebibyte, or MiB) is 2^20 or 1048576 bytes.  The HDD thus has 1000213577728 bytes of storage space, which is approximately one 'metric' Terabyte, rather than 2^40 or 1099511627776 bytes.  This space is typically divided into 512 byte sectors.  By using the metric prefix, they provide 193941504 fewer sectors (about 92.5 GiB) than they would have to to be accurate to the binary prefix. |-| 
|-| cnut5yc || 3 || Basicly the HD always is fooling you

when you buy a Harddrive of say 500Gb then mount it in your computer it will NOT be of 500Gb ... why because they count 1 Kb as 1000b instead of as it is 1024b
this iterates up to 1Mb is counted 1000*1000 instead of as the computer counts: 1024*1024 or 1 Gb as 1024*1024*1024 they companies count 1000x1000x1000 
basicly your 500Gb harddrive is actualy 465.6Gb


Every number when it comes down to computers have to be represented as a binary number. (1 or a 0). 
this means that for every new bit you have to add your multiplying with 2 

1bit =&gt; 2 numbers

2bit =&gt; 4 numbers

3bit =&gt; 8numbers

4bit =&gt; 16 numbers 

5bits = 32 numbers 

6bits = 64 numbers 
etc. 

TL;DR; the hardrive manufactors lies and do some big number rounding ... 
the Flash manufactors do the same rounding but since the number is smaller you will not notice it so mutch.  aka rounding 465.6Gb to 500Gb is more noticeable then rounding 7.438Gb up to 8Gb   |-|

So closely adhered that to remove the claw, the last bone of your the cat's claw has to be removed. Declawing is actually an amputation of the last joint of your cat's "toes". When you envision that, it becomes clear why declawing is not a humane act. It is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery period. And remember that during the time of recuperation from the surgery your cat would still have to use its feet to walk, jump, and scratch in its litter box regardless of the pain it is experiencing." |-| 
|-| cnuxpiv || 12 || While the term declawing sounds relatively simple, the process actually involves amputation of some amount of the animal's toes, potentially up to the last phalange (the final bone), as the claw cannot be fully removed otherwise. 

Cats tend to recover fairly quickly (a few days), although there are some reports of problems such as behavioral changes (increased aggression, pooping around the house, and such) to physical, such as partial paralysis.

If the cat scratching things is a problem it could be that they don't have something designated for scratching. It's something they *need* to do, and will do it on furniture and carpets if they don't have their own scratching post (it can take a couple of tries to get them a scratching post that they like).

Scratching can also be a sign of stress, often from another pet or human that they don't like or living conditions that are not as they want, i.e. being kept indoors can be stressful. i.e. all of this could be a problem that's been created and has caused your cat to scratch, something that could be sorted out without mutilating and hurting it.

If there's any time left before they force this on your pet, perhaps these could be an alternative [claw caps](http://www.softpaws.com/) little rubber caps that stop them being able to damage things by scratching but don't hurt them. |-|

|-| cnuzrqf || 15 || What I believe happens is this: you look at a post on the front page (or any page,) numbered say from 1-25, then press back in your browser to go back to the page. Scrolling down and clicking next will try to have reddit bring up posts 26-50 but from the time you originally loaded up the front page. The order of these posts may have changed by the time you click next, so reddit is looking for a page that no longer exists.

If you have RES the endless scrolling feature will sometimes show posts from the previous page, only they are grayed out. This is, I believe, the same thing happening: the order of the posts has changed when you are trying to load up the next group but RES is able to first show the most recent view, instead of one that doesn't exist anymore, then gray out posts that were in the view you were just looking at.

I hope that makes sense, that's from my experience looking at reddit with RES on my computer and without it on mobile. |-|

|-| cnuzvnz || 14 || From what I read, the aircraft was flying at FL320 (32,000' - but since you say you were an aerospace engineer, I assume you're happy for me to continue to use some aviation terminology). It requested a climb to FL380 to avoid some weather, and this was initially denied. The next time ATC tried to contact the aircraft, there was no reply.

It would be wrong to make assumptions before the investigation is complete. However, based on what I've read, I'm sure that one of the many questions the investigators will be asking is whether the aircraft encountered weather which it was not capable of handling.

As for why it was not able to recover with so much altitude, again, it would not be correct to speculate before the report is published. However, I'm sure parallels will be drawn with the Air France flight which crashed over the Atlantic in similar poor weather, which also suffered instrument failures as a result of the weather.

The Airbus is fitted with a stick-shaker and a stick-pusher, which pretty much ensure that pilot error alone won't result in the aircraft stalling. But the reports say that it stalled. Therefore, we also have to conclude that either there was some technical issue with the aircraft which prevented the stick pusher from working, or the weather was such that the flight modes associated with the stick pusher couldn't handle them. |-|

People who don't have the time, knowledge, or young enough cat to train will continue to declaw their cats. It's a good way to keep them alive and let simply anyone be a pet owner!

|-| cnuzxcs || 49 || There are many different ways in which a computer can be said to "freeze" and there can be many different reasons, but it's generally down to 2 things.

1. A poorly programmed application.

  Usually when we say that a program has frozen, we mean that the user interface has become unresponsive. This may also refer to the desktop or shell, which is itself just a program.

  When you move the mouse over the window of an application, click somewhere within it or press a key while the window has focus, these are called *events*, and the application is informed of these events. The application will then have a central event handler whose job is to decide what to do about certain events. For example, if the window receives a mouse move event, it will work out what is underneath the mouse cursor (e.g. a button) and then pass the event to that component. That component may then change some internal state so that it draws in a different way (e.g. a button might now draw with a glow effect to show that it's ready to be pressed).

  In order for a user interface to remain responsive, it must handle events in a timely manner. If it takes too long to deal with events, then the events might start to arrive faster than they are dealt with and begin to queue up. This can lead to noticeable delays, which gives the appearance of a laggy and unresponsive application, and if it gets bad enough, the application may appear to have completely frozen. One of the important events from the operating system is one telling the window that it must redraw itself. When these events aren't handled, the window will go blank, or display old images (e.g. of the window that used to be on top of it).

  The most common cause of this is down to poor programming, when the program starts some work that may take a long time (e.g. opening a file or connecting to a server over the Internet) while responding to an event. This lengthy work blocks the processing of any further events until it's completed. You'll most often see this when a poorly programmed application tries to connect to a server that's down or where the Internet connection is extremely slow; the entire application will freeze for several seconds before displaying an error. The correct thing to do is to schedule the work to be completed in the background (in a separate thread of execution), freeing up the application to continue to respond to events.

2. High resource contention. 

  When many applications becomes unresponsive, or everything does, rather than just a single application, this is usually because the system is lacking some resource, the two most common of which are CPU time and memory. For example, if the system is running out of memory, then it has to spend a significant amount of time swapping data between memory and the paging file on disk (which is very slow in comparison). |-| 
|-| cnuzzhl || -6 || Yes I think this seems to happen if you just browse reddit without upvoting, downvoting, commenting or contributing anything back to the reddit.    
So the best way to avoid this would be to contribute something back to the community :) |-| 
|-| cnv055x || 46 || Are you browsing your front page when this happens? Your front page is populated by a random handful of subreddits you are subscribed to. The subreddits that populate your front page are refreshed every once in a while. If you're on the second or third page of your "front page," it is the second or third page with that time's specific handful of subreddits, which has its own URL. If you try to go to the next page AFTER the list of subreddits has changed, the next sequential URL will have a mismatch with the subreddit selection and it will not display correctly.

Hopefully that made sense! |-| 
|-| cnv0787 || 4 || I've never confirmed this, but I think Reddit loads content on page 2 as a result of what it loaded it on page 1, content on page 3 as a result of what it loaded on page 2 etc etc.

If you have been on page 1 long enough to have it time-out (whatever Reddit sets that at), Reddit will have created a new version of page 1 that you haven't loaded yet (i.e. refreshed the page). When you try to advance to page 2, Reddit goes, "nope, that page 2 is no longer relevant" until you reload a fresh page 1 from which to extrapolate a fresh page 2.

I hope that makes sense. Like I said I'm not 100% sure that's how it works but I have my suspicions. maybe someone with more knowledge can refute or confirm what I'm saying. |-| 
|-| cnv08gc || 3 || Windows programs are event-based, which means at the core, every program contains what you might call a master program loop. 

This loop runs indefinitely, until a close message is received, and its main purpose is to constantly ask the OS "Are there any messages for me?"

When a message/event does come in (i.e. "window was moved" or "user typed something"), the program then has to process it, which takes some amount of time to do. During that time, the program isn't able to ask "Are there any messages for me?" unless the program is designed to be multi-threaded.

When Windows lists a program as "Not Responding" it simply means that the program hasn't asked "Are there any messages for me?" in a while, which also means you can't move the window or type anything because those events won't reach the program.

As for what can cause this, there's obviously a lot of different things because it depends on the individual program and how the master program loop is coded. Most cases can be boiled down to the program receiving some set of stimulus or being in some environment that the designer didn't properly anticipate or test. |-|

|-| cnv0hn4 || 5 || Tattoo ink is comprised of small amounts of colored metal metal - tiny little pieces that get pushed under the skin in liquid using several needles (the ink is NOT injected). These tiny little flecks of metal are what give a tattoo its color. If traditional ink were used it would fade much much much much more quickly due to natural exposure to light (the same thing that happens when a poster gets 'bleached' if left in the sun).

Your body doesn't want these little flecks in there and will try to actively get rid of them. The little flecks of colored metal are physically too large for your body's white blood cells to do anything with, so they tattoo stays for years. Over time these flecks of metal will break down into smaller pieces; small enough to be carried away by white blood cells and cause the tattoo to begin to lose its color and sharpness. This is why it takes tattoos decades to begin to fade.

This same principle of breaking down the larger flecks of metal is also how tattoo removal works. A high-powered laser is pulsed ULTRA fast onto the tattooed area to break apart the tiny bits of metal under the skin - making it possible for your body to naturally remove the tiny flecks of metal over the next few weeks/months.

|-| cnv0i4k || 1261 || Seems like a lot of answers here are mostly guesses, but some people go the idea right.

Reddit does not work like most sites. The "pages" you go to aren't really pages. For reddits sorting to work, it has to keep all posts sorted. 

However, having all posts loaded and sorted would take forever to load and would just be bad website design. In fact it's not possible. 

So reddit will paginate it. 

The way reddit does it, is every time you press next or go to the next page, it takes the id of the last post you saw, and tells the system "here is the last post I saw, please calculate the next 25"

And so that's what reddit does. It takes the last post you did see, then finds the next 25 (or whatever your settings are)

The upside of this system is that:

1. Content is dynamically generated - meaning if you go to page 1, and in the time it takes you to go to page two, something was posted and got 1000 upvotes right away, you will see it on the next page load

2. Reddit becomes paginated and easier to load and use. 

---

However there are downsides too, and these are both explained by the sorting algorithm. 

Reddits hot system is a mathematical algorithm. It uses votes and time and all sorts of little things. However, it's not perfect. It's just a formula that tries to calculate things. The downsides are

1. Duplicates - it's common and possible to go to page 2 and see some posts you saw on page 1

2. "Running out of reddit" - this happens as well, when the mathematical algorithm can't find anymore posts. Since something is displayed as "give me the sorted posts after X" if X doesn't have 25 posts that are sorted,  it will error out. The system just can't sort right, and when you ask for the next 25, it will just say "sorry boss, got nothin. "

---

This happens most when you take too long to go to the next page, as time decay in reddit posts can be heavy.

edit: Someone said in this thread that the timer of subreddits to show you on the front page has expired, which is very likely to actually be the case here.  |-|

|-| cnv10ib || 4 || **France**

First of all, we're an English nation and considering we were settled by English first, we still have that English/French rivalry. We even fought against the French in the colonial times. So there's that subtle history and, let's face it, how many people know that the French fought on our side in the Revolutionary war? Even a pop movie like The Patriot portrayed the French in poor light. In addition, France was seen as quickly taken over by Nazi Germany which showed incompetence. The issue is that everyone is forgetting the [Maginot Line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line) which was a collosal failure to try to contain Germany. It was a huge set of fortress structures which put a massive strain on the French budget and the Nazi's simply went around it. Since they put all their defenses there and Nazi's figured it was easier to just go via Belgium, it was seen as a major blunder, both in a quick invasion of France but also this caught England and all allies unprepared to deal with the front, not to mention giving Hitler a quick way to turn around and attack the Russians. If the French front was slow and bloody, who knows how the war could have turned out.

The other point for France is that it was against the Bush wars and they were in very recent memory branded as cowards. Remember "freedom fries"? So that's in recent memory which is driving the anti-French rhetoric.

**Poland**

[Rise of anti-immigrant nativism helps.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Poles_in_the_United_States#Anti-Immigrant_nativism_.281920s.29) In addition, if you visit the page in general, the older immigrants of Polish people (and others) were generally well-off and educated. The more recent immigrants (starting in early 1900s) were the poor and uneducated. The backlash is anti-immigration (see: Mexican immigrants of today). This is seen as both dilution of the American brand to be more poor and uneducated plus the problem that these low-skilled people taking jobs from existing low-skilled Americans - sound familiar?

With this backdrop, you also get the German/Soviet carving up of Poland in WWII, resulting in major problems. Poland was now seen as a weak country. Add that the perception of unedicated and low-skilled workers you saw back then, plus a hint of Communism ties, and you get a hated population. This is why Poland is such a strong supporter of anything against Russia - because Russia more or less gang-raped Poland with Germany last century.

I hope this helps. |-| 
|-| cnv16rd || -4 || I am going to guess that ketsup gained its populatrity with the publiuc about the same time as McDonald was on the rise serving french fries and using it in their burgers.

In the earlier days of McD many didnt serve ketsup as they said their fries were so good they didnt need it.  My husband was one of those customers asking for ketsup in the 60s and this is what they told him.  But I doubt if that explanation was company policy. 

At the same time that McD began their enterprise, America had just fallen in love with Burgers and fries.  In every cafe you could get them and they always served ketsup on the side.

So my guess is that ketsups popularity coincides with the popularty of the American burger and fries and dominated the market. |-|

Fine-tuning productivity dehancement is the function of reddit (and possibly other content aggregators.)

IT departments around the country (and, perhaps, around the world; we're not sure how far the program penetrates) monitor network usage, file creation, and other metrics to monitor workforce productivity. From time to time, in order to elevate productivity, reddit displays the message you describe. In drastic situations, the site may appear down. This motivates some to return to productivity.

|-| cnvswbn || 69 || Dental Student here:

The phenomenon you have noticed is called "Galvanic Pain."  Basically an electrochemical circuit is formed when metal restorations (fillings/crowns/etc) come into contact with a dissimilar metal alloy in the presence of saliva (due to the different corrosion potentials of metals in each alloy).  This is especially painful because restorations are so close to the dental pulp (a nerve).

Pain can also be caused if two different restorations on adjacent teeth are made of dissimilar alloys.  Often the patient will present with persistent pain in the affected teeth.  Diagnosis is made by placing a strip of rubber between the two teeth, to break the circuit, and seeing if the pain immediately goes away.

If a patient is suffering from galvanic pain, a simple layer of varnish over the restoration to prevent contact with metal will typical prevent the future pain.

Electrical signals within nerves for pain are typically under 100 millivolts, while the electrical potential from galvanic pain has been reported at 100s of millivolts and sometimes even exceeding 1000 millivolts.  It is easy to see why the sensation of pain results when stimulating the dental pulp with so much electricity.

|-| cnvt2xt || 7 || http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirated_movie_release_types

This provides a very good list of different types of pirated movies and how they are created.

Many many different people are responsible for uploading all the movies we watch online. You see the end result, which is a website full of organized pirated movies, but there are tons of users responsible for uploading all of those videos.

If you track a new movie from its release you will see 3-4 of the types on that list being released. Cam's immediately while the movie is in theater, award versions slightly later if you are lucky, and then Asian or Indian early release rips followed by good copy DVD rips once the movie comes out months later to buy. |-| 
|-| cnvtbzg || 7 || Religious intolerance historically has very little to do with the actual content of the religion and more to do with social, political, and economic context. It's like race. It's just people separated into communities and eventually there will be conflict.

Catholicism and many strains of Protestantism are so similar they may as well have never split into separate denominations, but that didn't stop the European Wars of Religion in the 1500s and 1600s that killed millions. The wars weren't irrational and pointless theological debates, it wasn't like they were literally fighting over what exactly communion bread is (is it literally Christ's flesh or is it only metaphorically Christ's flesh?), it was a fight between rival kings and alliances, warring over resources and power.

Similarly, the intolerant Muslims (who by no means are the majority) don't actually give a fuck about what non-Muslims believe, it's just geopolitics. It's a war over who controls the oil, and the Israeli occupation, and the rival regional powers of Saudi Arabia and Iran (who just happen to be Sunnis and Shiites).  |-|

The only way first world nations get involved in these issues is if someone makes people give a shit about the people there. The only way to do that is to print stories in the media until people notice and complain, which makes politicians give a shit.

The journalists go over and report the stories that make people give a shit about the awful things that happen there, in the hopes of forcing politicians to give a shit which might make a difference.

They are often subjected to the awful things they are documenting. |-|

Think of an accountant. They used to take 40 hours to do 10 people's taxes, they could afford to, there were less people and there was an excess of wealth. Now there are more people, and there's less economic trade going on, meaning that they have to service more people to expect a similar level of income resulting in more work per hour.

The same goes for everyone; cooks, mechanics, teachers, postal workers, etc. Because they have to serve more people, they need to work more, but efficiency has made it so they can serve more people at once. So instead of being 10 people served in 40 hours, now it's 10 people being served in 11 hours, but there's more people resulting in 35 people being served in 40 hours. |-|

However, upon taking office, he immediately started prosecuting legal marijuana dispensaries and growers at a higher rate than his predecessor.  This was not something that would have involved Republicans, at all.  It was entirely his discretion, as Chief Executive.  He just broke his promise, for reasons unknown.

When we talk about pulling troops out of Iraq before 2011, we might consider that his hands were tied to some extent, due to conditions in country.  Republicans did have much to do with his inability to provide socialized healthcare for everyone (which was more of a vague hint, rather than a promise).  

Really, I only hold against him the decisions over which he, as Chief Executive, had total control.  I wish that he had been a better negotiator, though.  Reagan was able to accomplish most of his agenda, even with a Democrat congress.  He just had that charm.

 For example, lighter-skinned people have less melanin than darker-skinned people. People with Albinism, however, have no melanin/pigment. Freckles are an example of concentrated melanin in one's skin.


So:
Red Eyes, as seen in people with Albinism, are produced when there is *no* melanin. From least to greatest melanin levels, the eye colours are as follows: Blue, Green, Hazel, and Brown. Brown eyes contain the most melanin, and blue eyes contain the least.

|-| cnvy4eo || 57 || &gt; How does ISIS keep finding Westerners to hold hostage?

People that go down there:

 - Journalists as said by /u/Beetin
 - Businessmen that happen to be in the area
 - In the special case of ISIS: Westerners that are muslims and want to fight their djihad with the extremists down there. I believe there was at least one case of a delusioned british boy that went down there and instead of being the ISIS fighter that he wanted to be just ended up as a hostage
 - People that are looking for an adventure off the beaten path, which I can relate to to some degree. If you just go on safe holidays you will just run into your neighbours all the time. As a European you will end up in Spain, Southern France and Greece. As an American maybe Florida, Europe or Mexico. If you really want to go somewhere off the beaten path the middle east can be quite exciting. An acquaintance of mine hitchhiked through Jordan a couple of years ago, while we stayed in Israel, two relatives recently went to Iran and are looking to travel to Azerbaijan soon. I briefly looked into going to Erbil, northern Iraq a couple of months ago as AirBerlin reinstated their flights there and there was no terror warning at the time (before the ISIS stuff came down and long after the war ended).

|-| cnvy4p4 || 27 || GDP doesn't take account of government debt. It is solely related to output. For instance, a car company buys steel and adds value to that steel by shaping it into a car. That steel is now worth more per kilo than it was before (value has been added) because it's been turned into something more than just the raw material. That *added value* is what constitutes GDP. Not overall sales, but the amount of stuff the country *produces*.

The USA has the biggest economy in the world and the largest GDP.

However, not everyone would call the country with the highest GDP the "richest" country. That is very much more subjective and depends on what you value as an indicator of "rich".

After America, China has the next largest GDP, but few would consider China to be "a rich country" when you look at GDP *per capita*. BY GDP per capita, the USA comes between 9th and 14th depending on who's measure of GDP you use.

That list is topped by countries like Luxembourg and Monaco where a lot of companies are based for tax purposes but which have a relatively small population. As a result these countries tend to have a lot of money to spend per capita and enjoy a good quality of life - despite not having the largest GDP, by some measures you would say *they* were the richest. |-|

|-| cnvyit2 || 24 || It doesn't. At least no more than any other cooking method. Some nutrients (like vitamin C) are heat sensitive, so you'll lose quite a bit (but not all) because the heat changes the nature of the nutrient - so your body no longer recognizes it or can use it as the original nutrient.

Many nutrients however are not heat sensitive (or nearly as sensitive as vitamin C). 

Also keep in mind that cooking in many cases greatly increases the bioavailability of nutrients (especially in vegetables). This means your body can absorb *more* nutrients, even if technically there is less available.

It is also a common misconception that deep frying means that your food is getting cooked because of heat from fat. What actually happens (and also why it is so important to coot in HOT fat / oil) is that the water inside your food heats up an turns into steam.

Because water and oil do not mix - the water / steam cannot escape the food (which you can see yourself when pan frying for example). Your food is actually getting steamed from the inside out.

Additionally - the water / steam also prevents oil from getting *into* the food. However if you overcook the food, or use cold oil - there will not be enough steam to make this happen - and you end up with overly greasy deep fried food. |-|

I don't know that there's a good ELI5 answer to either of these, but ultimately what it boils down to is that people have limited contact with diverse ideas. "Birds of a feather flock together" is the old expression that might apply. It's the same reason I don't understand how the French can eat snails, and I assume they really don't like me thinking that a twinkie is god's gift to pastries.

In England, I'm sure it LOOKS like the US hates the republicans more than the Democrats, but ultimately we're pretty evenly split between light and right with the real lion share these days being people in the middle. u/RollingSevens may have said it best, where you get your information matters.

Consider that a third of the world has never made a telephone call, they must have some pretty inexplicable ideas about communication compared to the rest of us. Not everyone in America is sitting in a Starbucks on their iPad talking to their neighbor about how horrible vaccinations and GMO are. Just like not every American is eating out at Applebees talking about which shotgun to get Junior for his 12th Birthday.

Ultimately, people also don't pay a lot of attention, or they might think, huh, I don't pirate things online, so SOPA can't affect me, but these taxes, they affect me, so I'll vote Republican in an attempt to lower taxes.

PIPA was sponsored by a Democrat, and co-sponsored by 22 Other democrats, an Independent that sides with the Democrats, and a measly 8 Republicans, after almost a dozen of them retracted their support.

The Senate: Rural states, the Senate isn't based on population - each state gets two Senators. So Montana and Idaho get as many seats as California and New York. In the 2014 election, Democratic Senators received 20 million more votes than Republican Senators. But, obviously, a vote for a Senator in Montana carries much more weight than in California. Couple this with the fact that we have a ton of rural states (rural areas being heavily conservative) and we end up with a lot of Republicans in the Senate. |-|

Whether they actually decide to is another matter entirely, as it is a costly process and they want to be sure that the investment would be worth it.

|-| cnx9jsd || 122 || Because deflation will absolutely **devastate** the economy.  There's a thing called a [deflationary spiral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation#Deflationary_spiral), which was a huge factor in the Great Depression.

In a nutshell, deflation causes money to rise in value over time.  So people stop investing and they slow their spending, because why by a car today when you can buy a car *and* a new computer next year with the same money?  So the economy begins to slow down, businesses suffer, and eventually have to start laying off employees.  So now you have a new set of people who are highly motivated to hold on to their money for as long as possible, resulting in even less overall spending, and even more businesses failing, and even more unemployment.  Eventually the entire economy grinds to a halt.

A small amount of inflation is necessary to prevent that from happening.  Inflation encourages spending and investment, which keeps the economy humming along. |-| 
|-| cnx9sy1 || 21 || That's a big question, and I recommend you do a lot of reading on your own on the subject, but here's a basic list.  (It won't be an exhaustive list, bit it'll be a start.)

Stocks are the basic investment tool, which is why people refer to exchanges as "stock markets."  A stock is a fractional ownership in a company.  That means that if a company has 100 shares outstanding, and you own one share, you own 1% of the company.  The stock makes money for people by appreciating in value as the company grows.  So the goal is to buy the stock at a lower price, wait until the market price for that stock has risen, and then sell it.  Also, so stocks pay what's called dividends.  A dividend is a set amount of money paid to the owners from the profits, and is divided equally among the shares.  A typical dividend is paid quarterly, and is described as some number of cents per share.  So you can hold a dividend paying stock forever and just collect the dividends and make money that way.

Options are contracts that give the owner the right to either buy or sell 100 shares of a company's stock at a set price.  They are more complicated than stocks, and can be a little confusing.  A call option is the right to buy 100 shares of a stock, and a put option is the right to sell 100 shares.  People "write" these contracts by selling them to other investors, and are legally binding.  So if you have 100 shares of a company, you can sell a call option, collect the premium for the option, and make money that way.  If someone wants to exercise the option, you are legally obligated to sell them those shares at the set price, and your broker will execute the transaction without asking you.  On the other hand, if you sell a put contract, and someone exercises it, you are legally obligated to buy 100 shares from that person at the set price, and your broker will execute the transaction without asking.  There are many strategies that options traders use to make money, but I won't list them here just because it's an immense amount of information.

Bonds are basically a loan.  You would buy one bond for a set price, and that money will be paid back plus interest at the maturity date of the bond.  Some bonds pay the interest during the term of bond and the principal is paid back at maturity, and the interest being paid is called a coupon.  The main way you make money is by collecting interest, just more than you would make from a savings account.  The bonds' price may also change due to interest rate changes, and you can sell the bond for more than you bought it for if the price rises, and you can make money that way.

There are also futures options, which are contracts to deliver a set amount of a commodity at a certain price, and the price of the contract fluctuates with the price of the commodity.  You can buy these options and sell them at a higher price to make money. |-|

It doesn't. Fat storage and insulin resistance are linked because they are likely the caused by the same thing: eating too much(caloric excess). Both sides of the equation of Calories in vs calories out are not stable either.

[Here](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/the-energy-balance-equation.html/) is an article that goes in depth(deeper than ELI5). |-| 
|-| cnxap92 || 379 || Imagine a creature that burns two apples worth of energy a day to survive. If it eats less than two apples, it'll feel hungry.

Without any insulin resistance, all the calories from the apples it eats will transfer fully to the cells in the body that require energy so when the creature eats two apples, it is content.

Now, imagine that the creature has insulin resistance. This makes it difficult for the creature to make use of the apple's energy. Imagine that it has a 50% insulin resistance so that only half of the energy from the apples goes to the cells that need the energy. It eats 2 apples but only 1 apple's worth of energy goes to the body. 

The creature still feels hungry so it eats two more apples. Only then can the body feel satisfied because the energy of half of the 4 apples goes to power the cells in the body due to the insulin resistance.

But what about the two apple's worth of energy that was not processed by the cells due to the insulin resistance? The body does not like to let go of nutrients so much of the energy from the apples will be processed into sugar in the blood. The excess sugar that is not being pushed into the cells due to the insulin resistance will circulate through the blood and causes damage throughout the body. The increased blood sugar is is one of the major symptoms of diabetes. Since the body did consume more calories than was normal, some of the excess blood sugar will be converted to fat. As the days go on, that excess fat will cause weight gain.

EDIT: Added some more information about diabetes in the last paragraph. |-| 
|-| cnxauti || 15 || Pharmacy student here.

The Diphtheria vaccine (Tdap or DTaP, booster Td) protects against toxoids produced by the Diphtheria ~~virus~~ bacteria, (sorry for the typo). Since the toxoids do not change, there is no need to update the vaccine. You just get a booster vaccine every few years to re-up your resistance to these toxins.

On the other hand, the flu virus mutates very easily, and so a new vaccine must be formulated each year with our best guess of the strains that will be mainly circulating. This is because the vaccine targets the virus itself.

There are also different types of antibodies produced by the body. Some are 'first responders' that are quick to appear in the presence of an infection. Others take longer to appear, but confer longer-term immunity.  Over time, these antibodies will be less plentiful in the body, which is why you get booster shots like the Tdap. 


&gt;But then I think of, say, diphtheria. We only get that vaccine once or twice (by my recollection). Same for measles-mumps-rubella. Tetanus is only every 10 years.

Just FYI, the Td vaccine I used as an example above vaccinates against diphtheria and tetanus and is usually administered every 10 years. So you are getting boosted resistance to tetanus and diphtheria toxins with each booster vaccine.

|-| cnxbbnv || 1385 || A legit IQ test is administered by a trained professional, and should be a one-on-one test (not a quiz online, not in a group, it should be you and someone with a stopwatch and some flip-books). It will give you an estimate how well you score, as compared to others your age, on of a handful of cognitive functions we currently think are pretty important to have. Verbal skills, nonverbal reasoning, processing speed, and working memory are the most common skills, fluid reasoning sometimes is in there too. 


Those skills are combined into one "Full Scale IQ" score, which has an average of 100, that tells you, on average, how well you do on those skills as compared to others your age. But that 1 number might not mean much if you're really good at one thing but crap at another. And you also might be good (or bad) at other things that are important in life, like long term memory, social skills, academic stuff like reading and math, that the test doesn't measure. And so the IQ may or may not accurately represent how "smart" you appear. |-|

2. Overcome extremes of climate


Read below if u want to know... i know its a bit lengthy.. 

The coconut trees or matter of fact have you seen palms and all the trees like them.... they grow tall.... very high. Grow in dry places desert or thick soil And its natures way of protecting its seeds from being completely damaged when they fall... imagine a coconut without its husk falling on a ground.... splash... unless its in marshy land/desert where they grow less likely i think. I havr some coconut trees around my home. Ive seen tender coconut fall and when they reach groung they will all be invariably cracked with water leaking and destroyed by next day but mature coconut wont be damaged at all inside.

Another point is that these trees are usually found in dry extreme climates... so keeping the seed alive till it has favourable conditions for it to germinate is another big issue. So it will have enough juice/nutrition in store for it to germinate and get rooted to soil so the plant can absorb nutrition from soil on its own... lets say in desert areas where water is scarce and soil is dry and hot as hell and since its dry arid soil nutrients in soil will be way under the soil. So it will have yo survive on its stores for some time


Finally saving coconut is designed in such a way  as to overcome extremes of climate by having enough nutrition in store and to protect that from damage of fall a big husk i given usually....

After getting some rushed answers on a standardised test. Where i filled in logically the last half of the test. A.b.c.d.a.b.c.d the computer marking flags this as slow reader.

So when I was about 10 I was given a 1 on 1 test. It showed was in the 98%ile for some things reasoning etc and 60%ile for reading etc.

They used this to decide I was dyslexic. I.e. I functioned below my other standards at certain skills.

The idea being that your skills should be approximately equal across the board.

They decided from this that either I'd missed learning to read from people reading to me. During the window of time when curious and interested and hence its easier to learn and teach. Or didn't have those skills. If they could do some tuition and push reading and writing to me through my other skill areas. My reading would improve..

These 4 indices look at areas that define what we believe to be types of intelligence. There are many different kinds of intelligence (fluid, crystalized) that the indices are looking for. They compare you to others in your age range to see where you lie in relation to the highest functioning and lowest functioning out of your age group. 

They use a bell curve, with 100 being average intelligence. 

To explain it very basically, they tell you how well you're functioning intellectually by looking at your verbal skills, your non-verbal skills (visuospatial skills), your ability to hold information in your head for a short period of time and extrapolate from it (working memory), and your ability to process information quickly.

Yes, owning more than 50% of the company does mean you own the company. This is part of how something like a hostile takeover happens. Someone makes a move, buy a bunch of the land and is now the principle owner of the company. However, this doesn't mean you can just run the company into the ground all willy nilly, because you actually DO have obligations to the other 49%

However, your example doesn't work because you're not able to just generate new shares with a purchase. In order for you to get the shares you want, you're going to have to buy them from the current shareholders. A company **can** generate more shares, but buying shares on the market does not automatically generate shares. |-|

There are some truths to what people have posted here, but most seem to be referring to the WISC or WAIS tests, which are just 1 brand of many. There are tests for people that are color blind, deaf, etc.  

The other issue is that you are really asking 2 questions that entire books have been written about.  I took a class just on "how IQ tests work" and a series of classes (Assessment I-III) on "what do they really tell about a person."

I don't know if you're going to get a licensed psychologist (such as myself) to type that all out in a single response.  But some of the answers here are a good start, but I haven't seen one yet this is 100% accurate and fully answers your question at the time of this posting.  There are too many different types of IQ tests, components of that test, IQ constructs they measure, and ways to score to accurately sum up in a reasonable response.  For example most responses have described the WISC or WAIT but have not addressed usefulness of comparing scores to each other within the test or to other tests such as academic achievement tests, or resting over time.  Or the possibility of alternative scoring such as calculating the General Ability Index (GAI) due to discrepancy between scores outside of normal base rates, which gives you information right there.  You would have to read several books to really understand the scope of the best response here.   |-|

The Central Bank wants to buy government bonds to relaunch economic growth in the European Union.

How ? When the Central bank will buy these bonds, European banks will receive a lot of money. This will allow European enterprises to borrow/withdraw money from the banks more easily, which will allow them to recruit new employees and new machines.

The central bank will print more money to cover the costs of this operation, this, will lower the Euro value, making it's value closer to the dollar value. This lower value will make exports easier for European companies : they will be more competitive.

The risks of such an operation would be to print too much money which would lower it's value low and create inflation.

|-| cnxh8xl || 7 || Hi! Before deciding I did not want to spend as much or more of my life doing research vs seeing clients I was in a PhD program for Clinical Psych and can shed a bit of light

One thing that most people don't know is IQ testing is only legitimate if performed by a licensed Clinical Psychologist or Neuropsychologist and these are the only professionals who receive proper training on the tests. That being said, it is not uncommon for other less qualified professionals to give them anyway. These are not technically valid. 

There is significant debate within the psychology community about what IQ tests actually measure. Think about it, what is intelligence? Ask 10 different people and you will probably get ten different answers.

Most "mainstream" psychologists , people really into testing and statistically-based diagnostics tend to believe that IQ tests accurately assess various dimensions that, when put together in context, represent intelligence. However, a large minority (myself included) believe that IQ tests accurately assess various constructs that essentially  add up to abstract reasoning ability, not something as broad as intelligence. The main reason for this is that IQ tests do not assess things like creativity and practical know-how and we believe these , along with the abstract reasoning ability assessed by IQ tests, are a better representation of the concept of inteeligence.

If you find that interesting I highly recommend the work of Robert Sternberg and his Triarchic Theory of Intelligence

If you're not sure if you have ever been given an IQ test it would have been, as someone else said, one on one only, it is long  about 1-2 hours depending on the speed and skill of the administrator and how well you do as each section continues to get progressively harder until you miss several in a row. Each section is designed to be so hard even very intelligent people should not be able to finish it, though it happens sometimes. Most people seem to recall the block design section the best as it involves making designs using red and white blocks. If you did this as part of a long test you probably were given an IQ test. 

The so-called online "IQ" tests are BS and not anything like real IQ tests. Usually just clickbait.

Fluid intelligence in layman's terms would be a person's cognitive functions and ability to process information. This is opposed to crystallized intelligence which is more along the lines of learned knowledge (facts, skills, processes learned).

Think of it as a computer. It is measuring the processor speed of the computer and RAM (fluid intelligence), Not the hard drive or what is stored on it. 

High IQ just correlates with learning things more quickly and problem solving. However, high IQ doesn't make one knowledgeable. A person with a normal IQ can be an expert in a field and a high IQ can know jack squat.

|-| cnxht42 || 6 || A few things.

**First**, whether a company is public or not is not really relevant to the question (other than here and there, which I point out below). All corporations have the same basic structure (boards of directors, stockholders, certificates of incorporation, fiduciary duties, etc.). Whether a company is public or not is separate, and is related to who can buy the company's stock.

**Second**, as an investor, you can buy stock from 2 places - from the company, or from other investors. When you buy a share of stock from a public company, like Apple, you aren't buying it from Apple. You're buying it from another Apple stockholder. That's what a stockbroker does - you tell your stockbroker you want to buy a share of Apple stock, so he goes and finds someone willing to sell you their share.

So, at any given point in time, there's a finite number of shares of a company out there. Right now, for example, Apple has 5,864,840,000 shares of stock issued. If you wanted to buy control of Apple, you'd need to go out into the world, and cobble together enough people who own Apple stock to sell you 2,932,420,001 shares.

You can do this - it's called a tender offer. And there are rules for how you go about doing it. You can either do it with Apple's cooperation (a negotiated sale of the company) or against their wishes (a hostile takeover). There are regulations about how you can do it, and what kind of filings you need to make, but basically - yes, you can do this.

You *can* buy stock directly from a company. So, for example, Apple could issue you new shares. If they wanted to issue you control of the company, they need to issue you 5,864,840,001 shares of stock, so that you would control 5,864,840,001 of the now 11,729,680,001 shares outstanding. That would give you control of the company.

But, Apple's stockholders would need to approve this. The government has a rule saying that public companies can't issue stock representing 20% of the company without the approval of the existing stockholders.

**Last**, is that even if you do control the company, you have fiduciary duties to your other investors. You're not allowed to screw them over. So you can't just have the company make any decision you want to enrich you and screw over your other investors. You'll be sued and lose. |-|

They shot Friends on film which is widescreen. At the time they were not worried about 16:9 aspect ratios because no one had TVs like that, so the extra space was just cut off on televisions. Around season 4 the networks started telling him to account for 16:9 because the transition to widescreen was imminent, but he said he was skeptical and didn't do what they asked.

This caused a lot of problems when re-airing the show in widescreen because a lot of boom operators, or animal wranglers, or gaffers, could be seen in the 16:9 area they didn't think anyone would ever see. This has required special effects artists to "paint over" these mistakes, costing studios a lot of money.

For example, let's say one person quite often uses compass directions in their day to day life (perhaps they work in a rural area). If they happen to come across a question in an IQ test involving this skill, they'll perform better than somebody who doesn't deal with these kinds of tasks in their regular life. This is just an example of course, but it happens quite often. It's difficult to say someone is 'smarter' than someone else cause they are good at something the other person hasn't learned or doesn't need.

&amp;nbsp;

Imagine you're in a simplified world, and your only two expenses each week are housing and chocolate. You live in a house and work in a chocolate factory. All of your friends do too. Each week you get paid $100, and you have to spend $20 on your mortgage no matter what - it's a contract. Whatever's left over you use to buy chocolates.

&amp;nbsp;

Week 1: One chocolate costs $1, so you pay your rent and buy 80 chocolates. Life is good.

&amp;nbsp;

Week 2: There is unexpected deflation, for some reason, and suddenly you can but 2 chocolates for $1. You pay your rent and spend the other $80 to get 160 chocolates! This is awesome!

&amp;nbsp;

Week 3: Everyone adjusts to the new prices. Because the chocolate factory only gets half as much money for the chocolate it sells, it has to cut its own expenses. Your wages are cut in half, and you only make $50 each week, but your mortgage payment didn't change (it's written in the contract). You pay your rent, have $30 left over, and now buy only 60 chocolates this week.

&amp;nbsp;

Week 4: The factory is in trouble. Last week, it only sold about 3/4 as many chocolates as they used to. They can't afford as many workers, and don't have enough work for everyone to do anyway. Some of your friends get laid off. You pay your rent and buy your 60 chocolates, and wish you were buying 80 chocolates like in week 1.

&amp;nbsp;

Week 5: The chocolate factory isn't selling as much chocolate as they wish they could. They lower their prices so that $1 buys 3 chocolates. You pay your rent and buy 90 chocolates this week. You have more buying power this week, sure, but you can see where this is going. That's deflation for you.

&amp;nbsp;

Week 6: Your friends who got laid off are skilled workers - they can make chocolate! They get together and decide to open their own chocolate factory. They need a $1000 loan from a bank to buy equipment and start their factory. When they get to the bank, though, the banker refuses to lend them any money. The $1000 is just getting more valuable sitting in the bank! They would rather wait - the bankers bet soon they'll be able to buy 4 chocolates for $1!

Meanwhile the factory has to cut wages again. Now you only earn $33 per week, but you still have to pay your $20 mortgage. With your remaining $13 you buy only 39 chocolates this week. 

Your friends, on the other hand, are now unemployed. They bought 0 chocolates this week. No one else is hiring, because those other factories aren't doing well either. They aren't able to pay their mortgages. You wonder how long it will be before your wages are cut further. Maybe next week you'd rather save your own money instead of buying chocolates. 

&amp;nbsp;


That is a deflationary spiral. Once the ball starts rolling, it's very difficult to reverse. It's why central bankers target an inflation rate above zero, so that when the economy starts taking a turn for the worse, there's a buffer between a recession and deflation.  |-| 
|-| cnxmfg4 || 17 || The Holocaust didn't just start up overnight.  Anti-Jewish laws started in 1933, very soon after the Nazis took power, and very gradually got more and more stringent.  There was resistance from Jews at every successive step, but not enough to make a difference.  Anti-Semitic propaganda had gradually filtered into the German psyche since the defeat in WWI (it had been there for centuries beforehand, but it really took off after WWI), so the average German was not particularly sympathetic.  

Moreover, the common Jewish sentiment was that it would blow over.  Anti-Semitism had risen and fallen again and again in Europe for centuries.  [Jewish Emancipation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_emancipation) had only happened in Germany in the 1840s-1860s.  So, many Jews simply saw things like the Nuremburg Laws as returning to the restrictions that their grandparents had had to live with.  Nobody saw genocide coming - that was unthinkable.  |-|

Some economists would say that deflationary spirals in the short term
(a few years) is bad because of unemployment and very little consumer spending, but in the long term(decades) they have positive results because the economy was able to re-adjust itself.

|-| cnxoqxw || 7 || Something other commenters haven't touched upon is that the networks (NBC especially) knew that the transition to HD was imminent, so they made the conscious choice to shoot sitcoms on 35mm film so they would survive the transition better. However, in order to truly air those shows in HD, the original film negatives have to be scanned, digitized, and cleaned up, frame-by-frame. 

So there are two reasons: the first being that some 80s/early 90s shows were shot on videotape rather than film (The Cosby Show, Family Ties); the other being some film shows haven't been re-scanned with high resolution scanners, which is a time-consuming and costly process.  |-|

It seems clear that the formation of formaldehyde is linked to the heating, as the amount increases the longer the heater is on. It also seems questionable whether you get much or any if you are taking normal puffs on it.

2) Art that is plagiarized (copyright violations, licensing issues, etc)
3) Art collected that was/is unknowingly stolen
4) Art on loan that never gets returned on time... or ever (dicey)

It would also be plausible that within the past 200 years, it went through the hands of many. PS, the Mona Lisa is a subject of hot debate between Italy and France - Italy, who wants it back, and France, who proudly houses it inside the Louvre.

Those many could include, which helps answer your question more: 

1) Museums (mostly unknowing)
2) Government organizations (like the Nazi regime)
3) Individuals (the knowing or unknowing)
4) Criminals (like other commenters mentioned below)

Insulin is absolutely instrumental in weight regulation. For some, eating carbohydrates and sugars cause a spike in insulin. When this happens the body, due to the increased glucose levels, goes into 'fat-storing mode'. This is when the body stores a large percentage of the energy consumed as fat instead of using it directly as energy.

This does not happen to everyone, peoples bodies react differently, just like not all smokers will get cancer as a result of smoking... but a percentage of smokers will. The same goes for people who tend to gain weight when eating sugars and carbs. Not everyones insulin spikes in the same way, some bodies are very good at regulating weight regardless of what is eaten. Some are not.

For people who gain weight easily, this tends to be the cycle... When you eat carbs and sugars, insulin levels rise, the body stores the incoming energy as fat. It is not using but rather storing the energy, the result... you're hungry. So you eat. If you keep eating carbs and sugars, your body will continue storing and not burning, so you're hungry. so you eat.
Because your body is storing energy as fat, you overeat. Thus, a result rather than a cause. |-|

|-| cnxt5z9 || 80 || Technically, an orchestra could perform just like a rock band: without a conductor and from memory; however, for both convention and convenience, orchestras use conductors and sheet music. There's a few reasons:

- Classical music is very traditional and thus is intended to be played as the composer wrote it. Rock music is far less formal and the performer usually makes on the fly improvisations and modifications to the piece during a concert.

- In rock music, the drummer typically counts the band in by clicking his or her sticks or hitting the hi-hat to ensure they all begin playing with the same timing. Orchestras, on the other hand, rely on the conductor to keep time. Additionally, classical music rarely users percussion as a time-keeping piece, so the conductor comes in very handy here.

- Rock music is generally built on a foundation of a few chords and everything else is based around that. The chord progression makes a song much easier to learn/memorize. Even if the performer forgets the specific notes to play, as long as they know the chord progression, they can improvise in key and come out okay. With classical, orchestral pieces, however, melodies are often complex and do not repeat or follow a pattern like rock does. However, the pieces break down into themes that repeat, but this is not quite like a rock chord progression. Furthermore, the time signature and key signature in a classical piece changes. These facts, along with the fact that classical musicians are trained not to improvise during a performance means orchestras use sheet music.

- The use of electric instruments in a rock concert means a sound technician determines volume levels. While the performers still control how "soft" or "loud" they play, the overall mix is in the hands of the sound engineer. Since orchestras are all acoustic, the resulting sound depends on the performers playing their instruments with the appropriate expression and dynamic, as dictated by the sheet music, another important reason why orchestras use sheet music.

Overall, its not impossible to play orchestral classical music without a conductor and sheet music, but the presences of the two allows the performance to stay true to convention and play the piece as the composer intended. This is why you can have various orchestras play the same classical piece (say Beethoven's 5th symphony) that was never recorded by the composer and they all sound pretty much the same. However, reproducing a rock piece without sheet music, even if a recording is available, tends to have a twist based on the interpretation of the performer.

|-| cnxvfml || 11 || A long time ago a fellow by the name of Alfred Binet was tasked with coming up with a test to figure out the intelligence of children for reasons of school placement. If memory serves (and I'm in the middle of something so I am not going to take the time to look this up) the idea was to identify children with low intelligence. It might have been the other way around and to identify gifted children. It doesn't really matter.

The problem with trying to measure intelligence is that no one can really agree on what the definition of it is. You ask a 100 different professionals and you may receive 100 different answers. Possibly more. Try defining it for yourself without referencing the word or a synonym for it. It's hard.

So, what Binet did was start finding tests that identify skills people associate with intelligence and looked for trends and created the first practical IQ test. One of the multiple types of IQ tests we use today is actually still strongly based upon this original test that Binet created. 

So what does it actually measure?

Nothing? Something? Maybe?

In theory the original idea was it stood for your mental age divided by your physical age multiplied by 100.  So, if someone was 4 and had the mind of a 6 year old then the formula would work out like this.  6/4 = 1.5.  1.5 X 100 = 150.  

The problem with that is obvious. It only works for very, very young people. It may not even be measuring intelligence but rather verbal skills.  The difference between having a mind of a 20 year old versus the mind of a 35 year old isn't that significant.  But, that should work out to having an IQ of 175.  

It's better to think of an IQ as a number that has a statistically significant relationship with what we think of as intelligence. That is to say that what people tend to generally agree upon as a sign of intelligence goes up, this number should go up as well.  As what we think of as intelligence goes down this number should fall off as well.

Does it work? Yeah, kind of. IQ tests have a lot of focus on math and verbal skills. Why? Because when Binet started compiling all these myriad tests that were supposed to be linked to IQ those were common trends that he found across all of them. We tend to associate higher intelligence with strong verbal and math skills and lower intelligence with weaker skills. This test of his seemed to work pretty well and we've built upon that idea since. There are other areas that are tested including memory and logic skills, yes, but verbal and math skills are a big part. 

So, could you say that IQ tests are a measure of your math and verbal skills?  Well, in very, very early incarnations of the test that closer to true than it is now. Now there are a lot more factors that go in including how long you take to answer certain questions. 

Fine. So it isn't exactly measuring verbal or math skills. It's measuring a lot of different mental skills that we tend to associate as being closely linked to intelligence, whatever that may be.  What does this tell you about a person?

It . . . sort of . . .  depends. 


For one thing there is something out there called the Flynn Effect. Look it up if you like, but the general idea is that they have to keep redoing IQ tests every few years and make them harder. It's like the IQ of the planet is going up. Except, since the average IQ for the population is supposed to be 100, you have to renormalize the data.  If you take a current version of an IQ test versus an older version you should score higher on the older version. Are people getting smarter?  If we follow the trend backwards we should find people around the time of the founding of the United States had an average IQ of about 75.  That can't be right. How can people be that much smarter today?

The idea is that they aren't. But what we do have is a population at large where a larger and larger percentage of people have mindsets that work well on standardized tests. I'm not trying to suggest they are gaming the system or cheating. It's more like a frame of reference situation where things that were foreign to a larger percentage of the population are more commonplace now.

So, IQ tests have to change to account for the fact that the populations common skill sets keep evolving. So we have to shift how well people have to use some of those strategies to be considered "intelligent." Sure.

But it gets stranger. Someone else mentioned the standard deviation for the IQ test is 15.  If you aren't familiar with statistics, the standard deviation is a way of describing the curve of how the numbers clump together. Start from the highest point of the curve and go 15 points up and 15 points down and around 66% of the population should fall in there somewhere.  For IQs that means 85 to 115. By the time we get to the second standard deviation we should have something like  70 90% of the population (depends on the test and how they curve the population).  So, from 70 to 130 should be where most people are found. Up from there we get to smaller and smaller portions of the population.

Good. But the margin of error is 5. That's in either direction to. So if you have an IQ of 120 your IQ may be 115 or 125.  So if your actual IQ can be anywhere withing 10 points difference and the standard deviation is 15 points you now see a problem. Just a few points difference can mean a world of difference on which level of standard deviation you fall on.

By the way. If anyone ever heard that the definition of a genius is an IQ at or above 140, that's why.  3 standard deviations, which should account for 98% of the population, is 45 points.  So, anyone who falls outside this gap makes up approximately 2% of the population. 65 on the low side and 145 on the high side. But, since your IQ can be off by as much as 5 points, we fudge down to 140 and assume they fall on the high end as well.

*gasp gasp gasp* Getting tired.

Okay, so what else can we say about IQ?  Well, it's also not stable before the age of about 16. So if you are quoting your IQ from a test earlier than age 16 you probably are not quoting your current number. 

There are also some weird little quirks that work their way into IQ tests that presume a certain common experience. As such there can be a cultural bias that needs to be taken into effect. Believe it or not, making tests more culturally neutral is a big topic of discussion. If the questions is "People live in:  A) houses B) Trees C) Caves D) Cardboard boxes" and you are one of the million some odd people in China who live in caves, you are likely to get that question wrong. No, that isn't an actual question. But it is an example of how cultural bias can sneak in.

So if we gave an intelligent alien creature an IQ test the results may be all over the place because he/she/it doesn't know what in the world is "normal" for humans.

If that wasn't bad enough, while we are really interested in high IQs the numbers have less significance the higher you go up. Really.  The difference between someone with an IQ of 70 and an IQ of 85 is pretty dramatic. One is low functioning normal and the other is someone who has mild to moderate delays. But if you trot out a guy with an IQ of 145 and one with an IQ of 160 there is very little difference between them. Same 15 point gap but it's harder to detect a difference.

Fine! So, now, like you are 5.  How do they work?  By carefully compiling a lot of data, we build up an idea how well a common person should do with a certain set of skills. From that we figure out how the data should spread out for the population at large. By taking these tests with these skills we can figure out where you are most likely to fit in with the population at larger.  What does the number mean?  It is more or less a position on a Bell Curve. What does it tell about the person? Depends on the person. Mostly it gives a fairly reliable indicator on how well they do on certain skills we associate with being strongly linked with intelligence. Is it perfect? Far from it. Is it good? Pretty good. Good enough that it provides useful data. Do the individual points really mean anything? Depends on where you fall on the curve.

|-| cnxvh7s || 3 || Well, first off a rock band will play the same however-many songs over and over again. An orchestra will cycle through hundreds of 2-3 hour long shows over the course of a few years. Rock bands can afford to do it by memory, because they play fewer pieces.

An orchestra is comprised of many more people than a rock band, and so the conductor is necessary primarily during practise, so there's a leader who understands what it's supposed to sound like, and also to queue in instruments that have been "resting" for 4 minutes or whatever.

Orchestras also tend to play music that is a lot more rigid, or traditional, and so it's expected to be played in a certain way. 

I have played instruments in both environments. By the time it comes to a performance in an orchestra, I do have the music memorised, but I often have important notes written on sheet music, and it's important to have as a backup just incase something goes wrong. It's not always so easy to pick up from a mistake when you don't have the music infront of you. |-|

|-| cnxzbsv || 11 || Professional in training here. I've given a few dozen of these.

The main theories of intelligence are that it is comprised of a large set of skills. There is an overall component (referred to simply as "g" or "General", in popular phrasing, IQ) that is broken down into smaller components and skills. Initially, this was thought to simply be "verbal" and "non-verbal," but we have learned that it does not break down so simply. There are some skills acquired through the environment and some through the genetic lottery, and most through a combination of the two. These skills can roughly be understood to how well you can solve problems, how much world knowledge you have attained (e.g., facts, vocabulary), your ability to remember things, and so on. We calculate an overall IQ score based on the sum of these skills. IQ score gives a quick, shot-gun overview of your basic mental functioning. What these components are, and how we measure them, evolves frequently.

The thing about IQ scores is that, by definition, most people are average. The theory contends that, after a certain age (if ever), you will always be as intelligent as you ever will be. Perhaps frustrating to some is that the scores are forced to be average. What does this mean? You are constantly being compared to your peers with this score. If you score 100 (the average score) that means you are about 95% likely to always score a 100. You may get older and smarter as you age, but so did your peers. Moreover, there's something called the [Flynn effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect) that shows that we, as a society, get more intelligent, or we at least get better at the skills that are assessed or more knowledgeable about the facts being quizzed. Thus, we re-test what is "average" about every 10 years.

What do they really tell about a person? If someone scores in the average range (depending on the test, but usually 80-110), it means their mental capacities are working just as they should. If someone is a little bit lower, it means there's likely some areas that don't work as well (which happens frequently), but others are working fine or better than fine. Once a score dips below 80, it means there is likely some elements of disability, and below 70 or 60 is indicative of disorders (e.g., intellectual disability, formerly known as mental retardation). 

Interestingly, scores in higher ranges begin to be predictive of less and less. Above a certain level, a person is capable of any number of things. IQ in the average to above average (and beyond) is predictive of college entrance, but not predictive of college completion (if I remember right). They've been trying to figure out what the upper scores of IQ really do. Terman [followed highly gifted children](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Terman#Thoughts_and_research_on_gifted_children) for a very long time, but the highest of the individuals with IQs did not excel, contrary to what he thought. In essence, there is a ceiling effect of what one's IQ is and what it means; lower scores are more predictive than higher sores.

**EDIT:** TL;DR: It is a measurement of a bunch of skills that come together to guesstimate how well your brain/mind work; above a certain level, it doesn't predict much, below a certain level, it predicts that you may have some big difficulties. |-|

So when you breathe in, the air 'feels' colder than normal because the nerve fibres respond more strongly at that temperature than they would normally. This hypersensitivity fools the brain into thinking your mouth is colder than it really is. In terms of cold water, it already has a cooling effect on your mouth, and the methanol amplifies this feeling (notice that hot water doesn't have this effect).

|-| co93raf || 1243 || I would guess - I'm not entirely sure - that your lamp detects changes in its capacitance. The capacitance, easily said, is the amount of power you need to charge the lamp fully. If the lamp stands by itself, it has a certain capacitance. If the cat sits on it, that capacitance changes, because the cat is now part of the system. ~~That means when the cat initially sits on the lamp, the lamp should toggle~~ (Actually there might be a threshold the cat doesn't meet. That's probably to prevent evil cats from strobing your bed light). Now when you touch your cat, you add to the whole system's capacitance even more. The lamp detects that and toggles.

[There are several methods of detecting changes in capacitance.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitive_sensing)

|-| co99dcz || 92 || Relatedly, here's a fun thing to do if you work with data or telco cabling-

There's a tool called a fox &amp; hound. You attach the fox to a wire with alligator clips and it sends a tone down any continuous electrical path. You can then go to the area where you suspect the wire comes out. If you wave the 'hound' in the vicinity of the wire, the tone is picked up by inductance. There's a pointed part(actually a short antenna) so you can identify single wires easier.

If you have a real rat's nest of cabling built up the fastest way to explore is to hold the 'hound' in one hand and poke around in the wire with the other. The conductivity of your skin is surprisingly good. You can reach into an area with no visibility and grab a piece of cat-5 and hear the hound light up. Then, you already have the cable in your hand and start pulling. |-|

We have a floor lamp in our house that can be toggled through off / dim / medium / bright by touch. I came home one day and a bunch of my friends had just discovered our touch floor lamp, and the fact that you could toggle the light setting with a human chain. They were all getting in a line and every time someone added themselves to the chain the light would change. I walked in to a chain 6 people long, and they're all like "Get in, grab his hand, grab his hand!" I figured I would humor them and added myself as the 7th human chain link, only to be subject to a collective gasp of horror. The light didn't change. Someone else tried taking my spot at the end, and it changed just fine. He let go, I added myself to the chain once more - nothing. And that is how I found out I was actually a vampire.

|-| co9ntlq || 3 || To add to the other comments, this is related to capacitance sensing.

The lamp's circuit "knows" how much capacitance a human should be. The circuit it uses detects changes in the capacitance on the lamp's surface.

Imagine it like tanks of water. If you touch the lamp, you drain some charge into yourself, and the lamp measures the amount that leaves. If enough "water" (charge) left, then the lamp knows to toggle its circuits.

When you touch the cat while it's on the lamp, the charge flows through it, and the circuit works the same way. His fur doesn't work because it's non-conductive.

|-| co9asfy || -10 || I'll take a shot at it. I believe your cat is acting as an extension of the conductor at the base of the lamp. Essentially you're cat becomes apart of the flow of charge through the lamp by adding his/her little conductor like body to the lamp. However your cat does not have enough positive charge to ground the circuit of the lamp, but you do, so when you touch your cats nose you ground the circuit which demands more current from the power source which illuminates the bulb. I don't know how touch lamp circuitry works but your cat is definitely a conductor. Hopefully that made some sense. Electromagnetism is quite complicated.  |-|

|-| co8x397 || 51 || Because of how liquid crystal displays work. Basically, each pixel is composed of three colors, each behind a liquid crystal "shutter". This shutter can adjust its transparency, and by doing that it changes the color of the pixel. The backlight then illuminates the screen so you can see the colors.

|-| co8vftg || 27 || Extremely difficult. It is virtually impossible to plan where to take off from and land to a specific degree. I imagine you are speaking of hopping in your hot air balloon to fly to your friend's house. That is virtually impossible, unless you have a repeating wind current that would allow you to do so. As the others have mention, wind patterns vary at different heights, which allows the pilot some control over their destination, but they are relying completely upon winds that are often changing.

To put this into a typical scenario, balloons generally fly at dawn due to the predictability and calmness of the winds (also cooler air means less hot air to rise).  Now as you get the balloon set up for the flight, you release a pilot balloon (just a regular balloon filled with helium) to see where the wind is blowing at what height. At this point the pilot (provided they are familiar with the launch point) can give a general idea of where they will land. As in, I will be heading northwest today (or I will fly over that set off hills, but land before the freeway). That's about as specific as it gets most places. Some places do have very predictable weather patterns that can make this easier. The best example is Albuquerque, NM.  They have a giant balloon fiesta because you can fly a box (they also have a great splash and dash opportunity).  A box wind pattern enables you to catch a N, S, W, and E wind at different heights. Theoretically allowing you to land and take off from the same location.

TLDR: You can know where you are going when you fly, but you don't get a lot of choice in the matter.  You control up and down, the wind controls the rest.  Pick the right height to get the wind you want. |-| 
|-| co8sd15 || 28 || Wind at different heights can be moving in different directions.   The pilot has control over the balloon's height.  Depending on geography and air conditions,  the pilot can have quite a lot of control of where the balloon goes just by choosing the right altitude to travel at. |-| 
|-| co8z0s2 || 3 || I went on a balloon ride in Tuscany last October and our balloon was piloted by the Hot Air Balloon World Champion that year. Apparently the winner is determined by which pilot who can get closest to certain waypoints they are given.

While taking us he used the top of trees to slow down. That's right...our balloon had to crash on to the top of trees to slow down.  We touched down twice on random places he used for landing but had to regain altitude since the balloon couldn't stop forward movement. Our final landing was some random family's farm. The family went outside to take pictures and sort of looked at us with awe.

He said he will only fly the balloon in the morning In Tuscany because the air outside isn't too hot and unpredictable. On the afternoon it gets hotter and much windier making it far more dangerous.

He did use some ropes to pull the sides of balloon making the hot air from the flames hit one side a bit more than the other. This would make the balloon spin on its axis and sort of get some kind of trajectory.

[Here's a picture taken from the balloon I was in of the other balloon my family was in.](http://m.imgur.com/XPF2RPj) |-| 
|-| co8uimg || 29 || It's actually kind of simple really.

If you don't eat breakfast, you're body looks to other ways to begin fueling itself. If there's nothing in your stomach, it seeks out and uses glycogen (stored energy from food you've recently eaten) to run itself, and also to help your brain function properly. (Your brain gets the first go at any stored energy.)

Naturally, when this begins to happen, and even through there's no food in your stomach, your body stops reminding you that you're hungry, and gets right away to burning up any energy reserves (again, the 'glycogen').

The reason you're probably feeling tired is because -- and let's say you ate something carb-heavy, such as a bagel, or a stack of pancakes -- considerable amounts of blood is now beginning to flow to your abdomen, to help to begin processing all of the stuff you've just eaten. (Part of the reason why you feel 'sleepy' after a big meal.)

Your body telling you you need a drink, or wanting something to eat soon after breakfast, is basically just your metabolism speeding up and/or requiring hydration so as to move the process along more efficiently.

|-| co8y6ra || 22 || &gt;This left me wondering what her actual role is and what would happen if her heir was an atheist.

In order to become monarch, you are required to be Anglican and in full communion with the Church of England.  If they're not whilst an heir, they would have to convert and proclaim their faith to the Church of England.

Plus, when crowned, the Sovereign promises to maintain the Church in the oath he says.

Also: http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/QueenandChurch/QueenandtheChurchofEngland.aspx
&gt;In addition to legislating for the Church by Measure, the General Synod has the power to legislate by Canon in its own domestic affairs such as worship and doctrine, but The Queen's assent is required for the promulgation of such Canons. Such assent is given on the Home Secretary's advice.

Really though, she officially approves this stuff, but she doesn't intervene in Church doctrine and the running of the established church. She could, theoretically, as with everything, interfere. |-| 
|-| co8rez2 || 4 || Her role is largely ceremonial and she has no place in deciding Church doctrine or the day-to-day running of things, much like her role in government.  What actually matters is not her personal belief but if a monarch just refused to have anything to do with the CofE.  I think the likely result would be a brief but violent shitstorm followed by the ultimate severance of the CofE from the monarchy. |-| 
|-| co8rd49 || 5 || The Queen's position as Head of the CofE is primarily a figurehead.

Any heir to the British throne would be brought up understanding that his/her future responsibilities would include the job of Head of the CofE so they would be expected to either do that job dilligently (repressing any personal beliefs) just as with the other requirements of the monarch.

If a monarch felt they couldn't do that part of the job they would be expected to abdicate, although it's possible that if an otherwise-popular monarch didn't want the title of Head of the CofE then it could ultimately result in the disestablishment of the Church. |-| 
|-| co8rbfr || 7 || There's no real structure in place to deal with this - it would have to be looked at as an when a monarch chose to declare that they did not subscribe to the CofE.

|-| co8thnp || 31 || There's a concept called the "Hayflick limit", which basically says, a cell can only divide so many times before it loses the ability to. They believe it occurs on the DNA level, a piece is lost each replication, and when enough has been lost, the cell can't reproduce again.

All living creatures are constantly breaking down, and repairing themselves with new cells. When they can't fix the broken parts, they begin to fail, and death is on the way.

The rate the break down/repair happens, and the amount of times a cell can be replaced, varies by animal, resulting in drastically different lifespans.

It's worth mentioning, that in nature, animals (including humans) rarely live to this point. Predators, accidents, sickness, and excessive wear and tear (teeth worn to the point they can't eat, for instance) are generally what causes death. Dying of "old age" requires a very safe environment. |-| 
|-| co8tvx1 || 8 || Evolution selects for successful reproduction. The entire goal of a species is to create as many successful offspring of itself and to get those offspring to a point that they can procreate on their own. 

Depending on the species and their breeding habits, it may take days or decades to reach sexual maturity. Once they reproduce, certain species no longer care for their young. In these cases having the mature adult compete with the offspring for food is disadvantageous. Other species require care until the young can fend for themselves. In these cases, the additional resources needed to sustain the parent for a longer period of time is outweighed by the protection/training they can afford the next generation.

Species that can remain sexually active through longer periods of their life will also have less invested in each individual reproduction cycle, so evolution might select for trading caring for their young for multiple reproductive cycles throughout their lifespan.

Repeat this selection process over billions of years and billions of species and you end up with the spectrum of life-spans that we see today.  |-|

Not only are depressed people not motivated mentally but physical also.

It takes at least two weeks for anti depressants to kick in before you see mental results.

However, the effects on the body happen quicker than the effects on the mind.

 |-| 
|-| co92em6 || 3 || This is explained very well in Thomas Joiner's book "Why People Die by Suicide"  (HUP, 2005).  

First of all you need to be very clear that depression is not actually a cause of suicide.  People can be depressed without being suicidal and suicidal without being depressed.  Depression and suicidality occur together much or maybe even most of the time, but that's *only* because they have many causes in common.  

So, as Joiner explains in his book, when people are *both* depressed and suicidal, and you do something that *only* makes them less depressed, they are still just as suicidal, and now they have more energy and motivation.  So they are more likely to act on their suicidal thoughts. 

[Here's a link to the book at google docs; the original literature is all listed in there](http://books.google.ca/books?id=C7uiA5EB5GAC&amp;redir_esc=y).  (I'm at work and can't dig out the original refs right now.) |-| 
|-| co8q4gs || -4 || Because you are more energetic and motivated. You lack normal reason and emotions. You feel no highs or lows. Ehhh.. whatever emptiness, without the ability to sleep it off.  |-| 
|-| co8qv8q || -6 || It only significantly increases the risk for young people (~25 and under). The reason is that the brain finishes developing at approximately 25 so how an 18 year old brain and a 30 year old brain react to drugs would be different. We don't exactly understand how depression and anti-depressants work. Sometimes, they cause the levels of serotonin or dopamine to drop increasing depressive symptoms including suicidal ideations or acts. |-| 
|-| co8ov6a || -20 || Not sure what the scientific basis for the claim "Antidepressants increase the risk of suicide" is (because if that really is the case then I wonder why they're used), but:

The roots of depression are often to be found in a person's mind. Their belief system contains more negative beliefs and definitions than positive ones. 
I find that emotions are the consequence of beliefs and definitions. A definition that could be phrased in this way "This thing is reaaal bad" will often lead to, when confronted to this thing, a reaaal bad feeling. 

Now, with that in mind: antidepressants act on the brain's chemistry, imitating molecules naturally present in the brain. This has an effect on the person's mood, leading him/her to feel better. 

But this sensation of feeling better didn't solve the real issues (which lie in the beliefs and definitions). Thus, if someone stops taking his meds without having worked on a deeper level, he/she will be just as depressed as before (if not more due to having felt better and then going back to deep depression state). 


Don't take my answer for granted. I was speaking with my own logic, which might differ from someone else's. 

There might be another aspect at play but that seems to be the most logical way of explaining why antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide. |-|

First off, the state (Missouri) requires all high school students to pass a Missouri constitution test and take a semester long Personal Finance course to graduate. Those both cover different life skills, but beyond that it's up to the school. In my school, they are very committed to teaching the kinds of things you are describing.

Want to learn nutrition? We have Foods and nutritions (two levels). 

Want to learn about laws? Every freshman takes a civics class to cover that, but on top of it you can take Intro to Law or AP U.S. Government and Politics. 

Want to have a family (or be a teacher)? You can take Child Development (Three levels including an in class internship w/ an elementary school).

Need to learn how to stay fit and healthy? You have to take a standard health class, but you can also take Lifetime fitness (jogging, yoga, dance, pilates, etc.) which teach you how to work out for the rest of your life. Or if you feel more serious about it there is Team Sports (Basketball, Football, Baseball) and Weights class.


The point is, some schools are committed to it, but many simply cannot be. If you are in a less wealthy area or one that puts less tax dollars into education, your school prioritizes. Colleges and most jobs are going to want to see that you took Algebra over Nutrition 101. And if the school is forced into hiring a teacher and putting them in a classroom for one of the two, they are going to pick the Math/History/Science/English teacher over the Arts/PE/Life skills teachers.  |-|

|-| co8sw8c || 73 || Well, in terms of actual BDSM it is actually an incredibly shitty book. The guy in it is basically the textbook example of a shitty, abusive dom.

That said, the book is not aimed at people in the BDSM lifestyle. It is aimed at average women with a ravishment fantasy. And there are many of those out there. There was one college study that found roughly half of the women had ravishment fantasies.

Why? Because in general it is a way to avoid any guilt. Women are raised with lots of conflicting sexual messages. Be sexy, but don't be a slut! Wait until marriage, but if you say no to a man, you are a frigid bitch. There is lots of attention to male sexuality, but very little to female sexuality (at least not women owned female sexuality). And a lot of these conflicting messages lead to very many women having some level of guilt about enjoying sex. They enjoyed this, are they now a slut? With ravishment fantasies you kind of bypass that guilt because it is someone else 'forcing' you to do something. You weren't the one making the decisions, so none of the guilt can rest on you.

Additionally, there are many women with a very low self esteem. To these women too, these kind of ravishment fantasies can also be highly attractive, because it basically means that a guy finds them so attractive (even if they don't find themselves attractive) that he cannot contain himself. 

Fifty Shades of Grey plays into a lot of these sexual tropes, which is what made it so popular. It is also written in a very simple, accessible way, so it is easy to pick up even by people who don't read a lot.

(Just as a note, there are also a lot of men that have ravishment fantasies. Not quite as many as women, but it is not a female-only thing or something.) |-| 
|-| co8sjk8 || 12 || Some people are excited because it's a saucy book that sold a lot of copies, and they think it'll break down some barriers to talking about this sort of thing.

|-| co9do4q || 7 || The short and easy answer is because you sit down all day. Sitting down without perfect posture results obviously in slouching. Your hamstrings are connected to your glutes and to your knees; when you sit down, you glutes are pulled toward tour knees (also bad for your lumbar spine  because of erosion). Your body is what you do. It's become a learned movement, aka, you've got super tight hamstrings. 

Surgeons can manipulate limbs of their patients while the patients are unconscious with ease in all directions, but once the person wake up, the nervous system "locks out". In order for the nervous system to protect the body, it will restrict the movement into more familiar positions. 

So when I say you have super tight hamstrings, it's just an easier way of saying that your nervous system is restricting full range of motion of your hamstrings in order to protect you. Now you need to familiarize your nervous system with the movement. do static and dynamic stretches often, and try to avoid pro-longed sitting. Maybe get up and walk around every half hour. Sit in squats for periods of time. |-| 
|-| co9d0l4 || 4 || It might be because they're extremely tight muscles. The hamstrings help control many body functions and you don't realize just how many until you pull one (trust me on this).  

That said, stretch them more.  |-|

|-| co9bh2g || 9 || There are many theories behind the origin of the ‘Banana Peel’ joke made popular by the slapstick comedy films of the early 20th century. One hypothesis is that banana peels were representative of the pollution in New York City circa the turn of the 20th century. Public campaigns highlighted the danger of leaving banana peels on the ground (as well as other trash), but particularly the banana due to its highly visible color. The campaign against errant banana peels eventually led to the widespread use of municipal garbage facilities. A different theory is that the banana peel was a specific euphemism for dog feces – it was originally noticed that there was lots of dog waste on the streets, and people slipped in it, which is funny. But it is not a particularly practical device when used on stage, especially for family audiences, so they were replaced by banana skins, which are family safe, even though they’re not quite as slippery as turds, and certainly less abundant. |-| 
|-| co9ammx || 9 || Bananas were common street food in the US during the early 1900s, people would throw the peels on the ground, not in the trash and people walking would slip on them. Hilarity ensuesd

Note: It wasn't the banana you are familiar with, it was a different and now rare vareity (it used to be common) called a [Gros Michel banana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gros_Michel_banana) . It was more dessert-sweet like than the modern cultivar the [cavendish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_bananas) 

This helps make more sense of why a banana would be a street food, it was a sweet desert. |-| 
|-| co9lk50 || 4 || My understanding is that the original gag was that people were slipping over in faeces, (bear with me)  this came from late 19th / early 20th century comedy, a pre-automotive world that was covered in horse poop.
 Faeces is slippy as hell and people slipping over on it would probably have been a fairly common joke in the victorian age, akin to slipping on black ice. 
The banana skin was a less gross alternative used onstage and with the advent of movies and slapstick comedy, It's also less gross for the actor, While the audience still knew what the banana represented.
As time progressed we lost the common gag of slipping over in poop but still retained the banana, thus the jokes meaning  has been  lost on us. |-|

Not only that, but because the water is free to move around inside the bottle, the moment of inertia is not necessarily constant in time. Neglecting external torques due to drag, the total angular momentum of the water and bottle must be constant. So as the moment of inertia changes, the angular velocity of the bottle must change as well in order to keep the angular momentum (approximately) conserved. |-|

There are some processes that are relatively easy to do to high precision.  For example, take two pieces of mostly flat stuff (stone, steel, ...).  Put the two flat sides against each other with some grinding media in between, such as sand.  Rub them against each other, and you can get flats that are very, very precise.  This process issued to build a flat bed for your lathe or mill that is flatter than your old mill can produce. |-| 
|-| co8t9nc || 3 || This always amazed me. As a hobby machinist and an engineering student. If we have a set of calipers accurate to 0.005", and a mill accurate to 0.005", how do we make the parts to make the first 0.001" mill |-| 
|-| co9fzjz || 3 || Incoming Wall of Text!

Tl;dr - Math and geometry allow us to hit size sub .001 on a .001 machine.

As a simple example of how we can use not so crappy tools to make better tools I can explain how we can use a lathe with a least discrimination of .001" hit a tolerance of .0005"

Least Discrimination is just a fancy way of saying the smallest unit it was designed to reliably measure. So a lathe with hand dials that have a least discrimination of .001" can reliably make parts with a tolerance of .001" This is of course COMPLETELY IGNORING wear and tear on the machine and wearing out the ball screws and all that. More realistically, you'd be hitting .005" tolerances easily. All machines will develop some slop over time, it's called backlash and it's a constant fight for machinists and the shop owners.

So how do we get greater accuracy than .001" if the least discrimination is .001"? Easy! We can cleverly exploit geometry as long as we know how to do a little math. But there is one thing we must cover first.

Threads. Threads are freaking AMAZEBALLS, because they are so damn reliable. A thread is a ridge that wraps around (or inside) a cylinder as a helix. The standard thread in a micrometer (a precision measuring device) is 40 threads per inch. This means that you have to rotate the barrel of the micrometer a full 360 degrees 40 times to advance the mic one whole inch. That's already .025" per revolution. Now we simply add 25 divisions on the outside of the barrel and .025"/25 = .001" boom, one one-thousandth of an inch accuracy. And its super reliable, because threads, in and of themselves, are super reliable. If you rotate the barrel of a mic 72 degrees it advances .005" and only .005" it can't go any farther or any shorter or it would totally destroy the thread, you'd have a pin inside a hole (fused together) rather than a thread. Why can't it go farther or shorter? All them little bitty ridges and continuous surface contact make them very strong. Ever tried using the claw of a hammer to pull a screw out? But don't let me let you mistreat a mic! they are precision tools and must be taken care of! Lathes don't use this type of thread though, they have their own design. Lathes get their accuracy from the ball screw, a special type of external thread. Its basically a precision ground continuous bearing race. Now throw in a handful ball bearings in a special housing that virtually eliminates backlash and is also radially super precise and you have the mechanism that makes modern machining so freaking awesome. Enough about that though.

Now the lathe. A turning machine; I'll assume you know about what this thing does. A lathe has a saddle - it moves along the length of the lathe, a cross-slide - it moves towards and away from you, and a tool rest - can be rotated 360 and has a thread to advance the tool in the direction it's set to.

Now the clever geometry we can exploit. We use the right angle triangle. We use one side of it as our x-dimension and the perpendicular side as the y-dimension, the hypotenuse is our tool rest. We set the angle of our tool rest to whatever we need, this also acts as setting the angle in our triangle too. Instead of plunging our tool straight in (perpendicular to the work piece) with our least discrimination of .001" we set our tool rest to 12 degrees off our x-dimension and come in at an angle, giving us an effective least discrimination of .0002" Why? Because math. The sin(12)=0.2079 and cos(12)=0.9781 if we advance our tool rest one full inch along our hypotenuse we haven't traveled a full inch in either of our x or y dimensions. We have traveled only .21" in our x-dimension and .98" in our y dimension. Remember about the reliability of threads? You can be damn sure we only moved .21" along x

If we move our tool rest .001" along our hypotenuse at 12 degrees, we have moved a mere .0002" along x. This makes it realistically achievable to hit a .0005" tolerance on a machine with a least discrimination of .001"

I Hope this gave you some insight on how we can make better things than the things we use to make them.

Edit: I may have mixed up x and y but it doesn't matter, the results are the same. |-| 
|-| co9k63h || 8 || In North America, most TV broadcasts are produced in either 30 or 60 FPS formats. In the rest of the world, it's usually either 25 or 50 FPS formats. Film is usually produced in 24 FPS format (occasionally 48 FPS) regardless of location, but television stations often convert the frame-rate to 25 or 30 FPS (using various different techniques) to match the standard television broadcast frame rate in a given region.

There are various reasons why a high frame-rate television is advantageous:

a) The TV may be able to accept high frame-rate video formats outside of regular television broadcasts (e.g. from online sources, USB drive or SD card etc.)

b) The TV may be 'future-proofed' to accept high frame-rate television broadcasts in the future through certain video inputs (e.g. HDMI, SuperMHL, etc.)

c) The TV may have a frame-rate interpolation mode that averages the difference between two frames to create (extrapolate) in-between frames that help smooth the motion and produce high frame-rate effect from content produced a lower frame-rates.

d) A TV with a 120 Hz or 240 Hz refresh rate can display both TV shows and Films natively without any special frame-rate conversion techniques (which often leave unwanted artifacts) since 120 Hz and 240 Hz are both common multiples of 24 (film) and 30 (TV) FPS frame-rates.
 |-| 
|-| co9k1ne || 5 || TV shows are broadcast at 60 fields per second (60FPS for progressive modes &amp; 30FPS for interlaced modes).  Film is traditionally recorded at 24FPS.

There's no way to squeeze 24FPS into 60 frames, meaning that you get an irregular, somewhat jerky picture.

120 is evenly divisible by both 24 and 60, meaning that a 120Hz display will be able to properly show both 24FPS and 60FPS video sources.

Dunno why they'd bother with 240Hz. |-|
