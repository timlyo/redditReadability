This is a collection of their short stories about an alternate history where the US had a communist revolution in the early 1900s instead of Russia.

----------------------------------------

Baltimore City, Oct. 3, 1849 

Dear Sir,


There is a gentleman, rather the worse for wear, at Ryan's 4th ward polls, who goes under the cognomen of Edgar A. Poe, and who appears in great distress, &amp; he says he is acquainted with you, he is in need of immediate assistance.


Yours, in haste, 

JOS. W. WALKER 

To Dr. J.E. Snodgrass.

----------------------------------------
I wonder if there was an immediate call by the Dr to get him his coat, hat and gloves and great activity in the home surrounding the event of the man walking out of the house on a mission. |-| 
|-| cnu2jpn || 3 || "Fatherland" by Robert Harris and "The man in the high castle" by Philip K. Dick. They both deal with the possible repercussions of Germany having won WWII. |-| 
|-| cnu2m1a || 9 || Dominion, by C.J. Sansom. Churchill never becomes Prime Minster during WW2, and the Nazis take over Europe. The novel is set in the post war years, as the resistance tries to get a nuclear physicist to the US, to work on the A-Bomb.  |-| 
|-| cnu2m3h || 4 || Destroyermen series by Taylor Anderson!

Fuck I look forward to every new book in the series. It's fun, and it never takes itself too seriously. 

It's about a group of ww2 navy destroyers that get transported to an alternate earth. Of course, that's only how it begins.   |-| 
|-| cnu2tja || 4 || Pastwatch, by Orson Scott Card.  |-| 
|-| cnu2xyg || 5 || *The Alteration* by Kingsley Amis. Imagines a 20th Century world in which the Reformation never happened, and Catholicism rules. Young choirboys can become castrati if they're good enough, and the 'alteration' is the one they have to undergo.... It's a good thing the Catholic church doesn't go in for fatwas. |-| 
|-| cnu3207 || 5 || I've not read it personally, but my brother enjoyed SS-GB by Len Deighton. A story of the (fictional, obviously) Nazi occupation of Britain. |-| 
|-| cnu3210 || 3 || "Making History" by Stephen Fry |-| 
|-| cnu35lg || 9 || 1632 series by Eric Flint is amazing. |-| 
|-| cnu3d53 || 4 || The Hammer and The Cross by Harry Harrison. Apparently it was the start of a trilogy but it reads well as a standalone book.  |-| 
|-| cnu3eyo || 3 || "The City &amp; The City" by China Mieville - it's a brilliant work of literature and gripping detective story that also just happens to be alternative history  |-| 
|-| cnu3g74 || 3 || I don't know if this is exactly what you mean, but The Intuitionist by Colson Whitehead is amazing. It takes place in another time and place, but it's similar to NYC and the time is similar to now. Elevator Inspectors are revered and important in society, and they are split down the middle between those that use a "feeling" to assess problems with elevators, and those that check the gears/mechanics in a more traditional way. It's a really interesting allegory, surprisingly enough, about living in a racist or post-racial world. I'd suggest it to anyone. Whitehead created a really fascinating world with its own rich history and yet it parallels the real world perfectly.  |-| 
|-| cnu3o65 || 30 || Michael Chabon's *The Yiddish Policemen's Union* is a teriffic detective novel set in an alternate timeline, where Jewish refugees were colonized in Alaska during the second World War.
I've also read and enjoyed - to some extent - Norman Spinrad's collection *Other Americas*. |-| 
|-| cnu3qvt || 3 || One of the absolute worst articles I have ever read. And no.   |-|

 |-| 
|-| cnu3sol || 3 || Completely unrelated, but if you are in SC (Charleston area) make sure you grab a drink and a bite here. http://poestavern.com/sullivans-island/ |-| 
|-| cnu3tu0 || 7 || My two personal favorites are Howard Zinn's *A People's History of the United States* and the Oliver Stone &amp; Peter Kuznick collaboration on *The Untold History of the United States*. |-| 
|-| cnu417i || 25 || The movie wasn't very good, and some people might think it was stupid, but "Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter" was a fun read. 

I would also like to nominate "Lamb" by Christopher Moore. It presents the life of Christ up until the regular gospels take over. I'm just going to assume it qualifies as "alternative history," because the Jesus probably didn't learn martial arts.  |-| 
|-| cnu43fc || 21 || Kill? Of course not. It's a dark age of intellectual thought ruled by sublte censorship and stagnation, but it will pass.  |-| 
|-| cnu4880 || 15 || Neal Stephenson's "The Baroque Cycle".  |-| 
|-| cnu4gj8 || -3 || I thought it was tuberculosis, seen as pretty much everyone he ever knew died of it. |-| 
|-| cnu4kcc || -5 || I don't know what's so mysterious about a drunk man being found half dead in a gutter and dying a few days later, especially in absence of modern medicine. That it was Poe doesn't change the likely outcome of the situation. |-| 
|-| cnu4l68 || -10 || Did anyone else think [this](http://i.imgur.com/8KsqIey.png?1) when they first saw that photo?  |-| 
|-| cnu4lpv || 11 || Watchmen by Alan Moore |-| 
|-| cnu4p8j || 3 || Terrible slant. Let's compare collecting MP3s with collecting vinyl as proof that there is no money to be made in digital music. |-| 
|-| cnu4sxj || 7 || [Island in the sea of time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_in_the_Sea_of_Time) is a great series about modern nantucket island being transported into Babylonian times.

[Axis of time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_Time) is a good WW2 vs Modern army
  |-| 
|-| cnu53if || 4 || Leviathan by Scott Westerfield (3 book series) |-| 
|-| cnu53j5 || 7 || The Peshawar Lancers is the most divergent and yet believable one I have ever read. It was a good story, too. 

Basically, a meteor causes a dust cloud that freezes over The northern hemisphere, so industrialized nations fall apart and emigrate south. The book takes place in an India to which the British Empire relocated and forged a new empire.  |-| 
|-| cnu56dv || 10 || I can't decide if people were smarter then or now. It's obvious that just by reading the way letters were written back then, people in general, had a much better grasp of the English language. But if you compare that to the fact that people now have been able to invent things that make life so much easier, it's hard to come to an answer.

Either way, I can guarantee you that this letter;

&gt;Dear Sir,
&gt;There is a gentleman, rather the worse for wear, at Ryan's 4th &gt;ward polls, who goes under the cognomen of Edgar A. Poe, &gt;and who appears in great distress, &amp; he says he is &gt;acquainted with you, he is in need of immediate assistance.

|-| cnu6hqc || 4 || Rabies  |-| 
|-| cnu6pb5 || 70 || One of the **many theories** is that he contracted rabies from the vast amounts of animals he handled. The rabies caused his brain to swell and giving Poe extreme headpain/ache. The most common drugs for pain relief at the time was probably opium/other drugs. The combination of drug overdose and rabies probably killed him. The person who wrote Poe's biography/news article hated him and was a harsh critic and depicted him as a drug junkie. 

Edit: Don't take this word for word as none of it is proven. It is merely one explanation out of many for Poe's death. |-| 
|-| cnu6rwl || 4 || I liked Jo Walton's Farthing a lot, it's set in an alternate timeline where events go down differently during the WWII. There's two sequels as well. |-| 
|-| cnu6s6f || 36 || I've read *Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrel* fairly recently, and I have to say, it is just fantastic. It's fairly long, and fairly serious, but has a brilliant undercurrent of humour to it. It's set in the early 1800's partially during the Napoleonic wars and focuses on the revival of English magic. Also, the BBC has make a TV series of it (not sure entirely when it's out). |-|

|-| cnu7hl5 || 7 || It doesn't sound like alcohol poisoning, and you can't experience alcohol withdrawal after a short relapse if you have been sober for a long time. I don't think he was severely beaten or it would have been mentioned somewhere that his face was disfigured by injury. To me, it sounds like the result of a simple infection. You have to remember that before antibiotics, something we see today as simple: strep throat, a sinus infection, or tooth infection could kill you. If the infection had spread, he could have easily been delirious and without IV fluids, severely dehydrated as well. I would like to know what symptoms he had when he saw the physician before his trip. But my quack diagnosis: death as a result of untreated infection. The only mystery is what kind of infection. |-| 
|-| cnu7rsv || 10 || This is why I enjoyed "The Raven" with John Cusack. Was it corny, obviously super fake, and over-the-top? Yes, but considering how mysterious his death is, [I thought it was really neat to show that he died saving someone he loved, or whatever. Anything could have happened. It is likely that he was poisoned, though not for such a ridiculous reason.](/spoiler) |-| 
|-| cnu7slh || 4 || My parents grew up in Communist Bulgaria. They always seem to be pretty negative about the government of their childhood despite the completely free health care including dental, the free involvement in sports for children, high quality of education and high literacy rate that Bulgaria had at the time. This sort of attitude about a regime of 'awesome' had me completely baffled up until I read 1984 by Orwell.

|-| cnu8hy5 || 9 || Satire is being slowly killed by the strange shift of Old Left to the New Right. What is considered proper today, in general, is what was considered distasteful and wrong 40 years ago. Burroughs and friends could satirize the ruling powers of their day because their actions were so extreme. It was ripe material, in the uptight, post-war era. People wanted to be liked and be like everyone else.

These days, no one rebels. If they 'rebel', it is by becoming even more virtuous than ever before. They don't take off and drop out of society and do drugs and be irresponsible and stupid. They become vegan, crowd-fund humanitarian causes and become mildly interesting, viciously egalitarian liberals. They rebel by being slightly more uptight about newer morals than most people around them.

In most ways, today we are stuck in a 1950's world of everyone striving to be utterly Good, in the capital G sense. Back then you could rebel against stuffy middle-class values and your parents that didn't like people who were the wrong color or sexual identity. How do you do that today? You'd get soooo many dislikes or hashtags with unhappy faces.

And, what exactly is there to rebel against?

So, satire is less easy to do now because the lines between Us and Them don't really exist anymore. There aren't really a lot of clear alternatives to total acceptance. The 8-ball keeps coming up 'Uncertain.' 

Until someone is interesting enough to stand up and offer the same sort of mildly frightening alternative to what seems right, good and safe to a segment of the public that is willing to hear it, satire and rebellion will be difficult to do. Until then, we live in a multi-cultural, accepting, kind, somehow still bland Leave It To Beaver 2.0 sort of world. |-|

|-| cnuac26 || 4 || Three that I can think of:

Siddhartha (Herman Hesse) - the author's take on the story of Buddha

The Brown Book (Wittgenstein) - a book about how we use words |-| 
|-| cnuadq9 || 7 || Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse, 

It's about the story of a man trying to find meaning in his life. Also closely related to the story of Buddha. That book changed my life.  |-|

|-| cnubb4v || 8 || The third book does end with another Ba'alzamon showdown but that's the end of that. (No "inexplicable teleportation" though: it makes perfect sense how they wind up fighting, and I think it's a better fight too.)

Some later books do end up with climactic battles (involving or not involving Rand) but for what it's worth they're a little more interesting and less deus-ex-machina-like as they gradually explain the magic system. |-| 
|-| cnube0p || 13 || Kim Stanley Robinson's The Years of Rice and Salt. Why? Because it doesn't deal with the Civil War or WWII. Nothing against those, but there are so many of those that nothing really stands out as great.

In The Years of Rice and Salt, The Black Death destroys 99% of Europe's population. Starting from there, we see what happens throughout history. The Arabs colonize the European continent. A Renaissance type event happens in Samarkand. The Chinese conquer Japan, the latter descending upon the western coast of North America. And so on and on. Like other works of KSR there are themes throughout and lots of exploration of Confucianism and Buddhism which become dominant ideologies.

The great thing about the book is that there are the same group of characters being born over and over. They don't know each other but they keep encountering each other. Easy to tell who they are as their first names always begin with the same letter.

Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in Asian history and cultures. |-|

|-| cnuepwl || 3 || Hi Shari! I have a few questions for you, actually. So as a person relatively newish to the publishing/book world, I'm curious how much has changed since you published your first book in 2006, and now this one in 2015? Second, this debate seems to pop up every few years - MFA or no? How has your MFA changed your writing, what do you see as the pros and cons of getting one? |-| 
|-| cnuff1q || 3 || Loved Maurice. The best part was the unapologetically happy ending. It's the only Forster book I've read, I really should look to reading some of his other work.  |-| 
|-| cnufrsv || 3 || You will need tissues. |-| 
|-| cnugfcx || 4 || Guns of the south by Harry turtledove |-| 
|-| cnugsl5 || 3 || The Shinning and then subsequently Doctor Sleep will always be on my top list. |-| 
|-| cnugtcw || 3 || I hope you know how to swim because you're about to drown in your tears.  |-| 
|-| cnuict6 || -3 || depends. are you reading the original or a translation? If original, is your first language other than Italian? |-| 
|-| cnuifsl || 3 || I reads version of Dante's Inferno where the cantos were translated in "simplified" English and after every chapter there would be another translation with information on the people Dante wrote about and what they did to be out in certain rings of the Inferno. I think it is better, especially if you don't speak or understand Italian or know who it is Dante is referring to. Since most people in the comedy were former friends, enemies, and mentors of the author and also it mentions other historical figures and legends like Julius Caesar and the Roman Gods Pluto, the Cerberus.  |-| 
|-| cnuimbk || 3 || Don't call him Edger. It's "Nightpain".  |-| 
|-| cnuimg7 || 3 || The socialism essay by Oscar wilde |-| 
|-| cnuimmq || 6 || No, that's a great way to do it. You're giving it a go by reading it directly, and then using the resources at your disposal to improve your comprehension of what you missed after the fact. This is actually a strategy many English teachers recommend. I imagine that as you get used to the language, you will probably become less reliant on the summaries. The only thing more you could do would be to read the chapter a second time after you've read the summary, to see if you can figure it out that time. But really, it's all up to you how you want to go about the task to get the most out of it. |-| 
|-| cnuipcw || 3 || Totally love/hate that book. Good luck.  |-| 
|-| cnuit2j || 4 || Not cheating at all! It sounds ideal - you'll understand more, get more out of it &amp; enjoy it more. Yes, it's fun discovering things for yourself, but you're reading the summary *after* the chapter, not before it, so there is plenty of room to let your brain puzzle things out alone. Academics who study this will still refer to other academics' views on the book. There's no point in reinventing the wheel as long as you're doing your own thinking &amp; contributing.  |-| 
|-| cnuixki || 3 || Nope! You can't be expected to understand all the cultural references that people in his time and place understood.  |-| 
|-| cnuiyv1 || 22 || I'm an English teacher, and I would suggest doing it the other way around: read the summary first, then the original text, that way you aren't struggling to figure out the basic story, and can just focus on the poetry.  |-| 
|-| cnuji0u || 3 || I also find that I read different things depending on the time of day. During the day I tend to read more intensive, non-fiction, but I like to read some easy fiction right before bed. I also like to reread books, and I find a book that I am rereading to be a good bedside companion. Most recently, I have been reading some Star Wars novels and rereading the Lord of the Rings before bed. |-| 
|-| cnujimd || 3 || Immanuel Kant: *[Answering the Question: What is Enlightenment?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answering_the_Question:_What_is_Enlightenment%3F)* and *[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_Peace:_A_Philosophical_Sketch)* |-| 
|-| cnujuq7 || 3 || Crash by JG Ballard |-| 
|-| cnul1r2 || 105 || This is ok everywhere  |-| 
|-| cnumbcr || 4 || The last 22 pages of that book hurt more than anything i think I've read.  What an amazing book,  I'm glad I'm just by myself tonight.  An overwhelming sadness reading the end,  as well as several other parts.  It's really rare that a fiction book makes me really analyze the way i have talked to and behaved towards people in my life.  I'm really glad i read it.   |-| 
|-| cnumq3c || 18 || To what extent do you think the American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have exacerbated Islamic terrorism, if at all? What about their support for Israel?     
    
I understand you have been in dialogue with Sam Harris. What is your opinion on "new" atheism (Hitchens, Harris, Dawkins, etc.) and its often confrontational style? A lot of people seem to think they do more harm than good.      
    
Finally,  what for you was the turning point away from Islamic extremism?  Forgive me for not yet having read your book,  where this is probably answered. 
 |-| 
|-| cnumrdv || 6 || I am a history student at the University of Baltimore, they have a [statue](http://www.baltimoreorless.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Poe1.jpg) of him out in the front of our school! |-| 
|-| cnun4l1 || 15 || This makes me happy.  |-| 
|-| cnunq9h || 3 || Thank you for taking the time to do this.

Do you believe there is a high risk of extremist attacks such as the Charlie Hebdo one, occurring in London, or other Western cities?  |-| 
|-| cnunrzb || 6 || &gt;It's a stunning moment, although it hardly seems satirical any longer, in a world where people obsess over the Kardashians and "Duck Dynasty."

We don't obsess over these pieces of culture, but their ubiquity far supersedes the cultures ability to process and compartmentalize all this garbage. It isn't just Duck Dynasty and the Kardashians, it's also those outliers that allow them a stage; it's the entirety of E!'s programming, it's NBC's willingness to talk about them on the morning shows, it's the medias ability to take a backwoods bumpkin like Phil Robertson seriously because he has a TV show.

This has killed satire in a way because it's hard to make a satire of stuff produced by our culture that's so fucking stupid, that satire by an extension/reflection of our culture of it might just look tame or the same. The British have a reality show where contestants have to outrun several rabid dogs down a straight runway. It's like bloodthirsty Gladiatorial sideshows broadcast with low stakes. No one dies, but they are bruised. I find that satirists of the 70's and 80's like Terry Southern and Jack Handy have passed the mantle onto writers like Joshua Ferris, Jonathan Lethem and Simon Rich. And even they have trouble with genuine satire in the vein of Elmer Gantry. America isn't as parochial as it once was, it's just moved on to a more ubiquitous medium and that's the television. |-| 
|-| cnunu0s || 9 || I saw your debate with Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Douglas Murray on IQ2. It was really interesting to watch you guys debate. 

You said you started turning away from radical Islamism when you were in prison and you talked with prisoners who had been there for many years. What did they say to convince you?

Also, are you happy with the way the debate turned out? Anything you'd want to change about your argument? |-| 
|-| cnuo004 || 63 || Only one obstacle remains. Now all I need is that Pizza Hut reading rewards punch card back. Ill never leave the house again. Just read books and order pizza. |-| 
|-| cnuoyg8 || 5 || What do you believe can be done in order to prevent people from turning to extremism and do you think it is possible for it to be rejected almost entirely in the future? |-| 
|-| cnup3mu || 6 || This seems like a strange obsession with numbers. She writes about how life is too short for certain authors and their books, as if stopping to read something she might not agree with or find riveting is invaluable and will impede her progress towards some arbitrary number. What does that number even mean? Is the number of books you've read an accomplishment? Has the child who's finished the entire Bailey Schoolkids series (&gt;80 books) "accomplished" more than the young adult who's read a 15-novel survey of 19th century British literature? Does it even matter? |-| 
|-| cnupl3s || 3 || I just started today I'm at the part where he becomes the mixer! |-| 
|-| cnupl7w || 6 || Why do you think more Muslims than any other religion turn to violent extremism? |-| 
|-| cnupns9 || 4 || Hasn't Egypt just turned full circle and embraced military dictatorship, once again? Simply replacing Mubarak for Sisi? 

How can we not feel depressed that the Egyptian public simply ignored the democratic elections that voted for the Muslim Brotherhood?  |-| 
|-| cnuppr3 || 19 || I was stoked when I saw this project pop up on kickstarter. I didn't really have the money but I backed it anyway. Every kid should have the opportunity to learn the joy and beauty of reading.  |-| 
|-| cnupxlk || 5 || Worrying about which book to read because you have a limited lifetime seems like a waste of time to me. It could be better spent reading. |-| 
|-| cnupzd3 || 10 || $5.4+ million in Kickstarter funding, and *that's* the website they buy with it? |-| 
|-| cnuqm43 || 5 || What do you believe to be the best option that governments can take to reduce the risk of terrorism, and prevent young Muslims from being radicalised? |-| 
|-| cnuqndj || 3 || Oh man. I read that book in Grade 10 and to this day it's one of my favorite books. |-| 
|-| cnuqxgi || 25 || Take a look ... In a book... *sniffles* |-| 
|-| cnur16l || 7 || Upvote the shit out of this... It's fucking reading rainbow... To the top people, to the top! |-|

|-| cnurfw8 || 13 || It's technically been back for over a year now (maybe 2? The app has been out for quite a while). My daughter has been using the app for quite a long time now, and she uses it daily! Still, really happy it's becoming bigger and better - I grew up with it! |-| 
|-| cnurqdt || 7 || Okay, for a non American could someone explain this for me. From what I can gather it's originally a TV show? What makes it so great with so many fans? |-| 
|-| cnurrnq || 3 || Hi Maajid! I bought your book (tweeted to you about it!) but I have not started yet so

1) How did you learn Arabic?

2) How should go about tackling Islamism, criticizing Islam without appealing to the racists (as SOME anti-islam criticism is fueled by racism, but not all!)

Thanks again! |-| 
|-| cnus0l9 || 9 || No love for Android? |-| 
|-| cnus3c8 || 3 || Hi Maajid

Are you afraid you may have boarded a sinking ship by standing for the Lib Dems, who are expected to be the big losers of the GE? What is it about the likes of Tories, Labour, Greens that made you decide against standing for them?  |-| 
|-| cnus3jv || 4 || First off, let me say that I admire your courage and think that what you are doing is really important. Thank you for that!

Although you have left Islamism, you still identify yourself as a Muslim. Which Islamic principles do you still adhere to? In all of the interviews I have seen with you, I get the vibe that you might as well be an ex-Muslim (like Ayaan Hirsi Ali). I am curious as to why that isn't the case (other than for safety reasons). |-| 
|-| cnus3pc || 4 || Out of curiosity I've always wondered how is the liberal protest culture of Egypt? I am definitely friends in my protest circle that tell me that they have worked with people with anarchist, communist, and leftist leanings in Middle Eastern nations. But I'm curious to how robust and organized those groups are in Egypt? In your opinion. |-| 
|-| cnus537 || 3 || Hey Maajid, big fan and thanks for doing this AMA. 
Has Mehdi Hasan formerly apologised to you after he went on newsnight not to talk about the cartoon you tweeted but to argue about the fact Quilliam called the Muslim Council of Britain an extremist organisation? After all you were right as the MCB think muslim schools teaching their pupils not to integrate with society are just teaching "conservative Islamic principles". Also what are your views on the Eric Pickles letter? Have you spoken to any offended Bradford imams about it yet? |-| 
|-| cnus555 || 3 || In your opinion, what is the best way to stop young impoverished kids from being brainwashed by the radical Islamists? How can we change the prevailing culture in many predominantly Muslim countries that encourage more radical and conservative Islamic way of thinking? |-| 
|-| cnusanp || 3 || Hi Maajid,

Thanks for taking the time to answer questions!

Wahhabism seems to be the enemy, for both Muslims and non-Muslims alike. What do you think is the best approach for tackling this ideology?

Is there any culturally sensitive way to support the growing non-religious movements in the Islamic world? It would appear that many Islamic states equate non-religion with blasphemy.  |-| 
|-| cnusel4 || 11 || How has the Quilliam foundation succeeded? What tangible results does your work have to show?  |-| 
|-| cnusfqt || 5 || Last year there were talks of trying to ban the group Hizb ut-Tahrir in Australia and I know you used to be a member of that group. Could you give us your thoughts on attempts to ban it? |-| 
|-| cnusgx7 || 9 || Thanks for the understanding (and hope) I got from your book. 

Two questions:

1. Do you think the core counter-terror strategy of western governments (beefed up security services, communications monitoring, metadata retention [etc]) is the right way to deal with terrorism? If not, what would be a better core strategy?

2. What sort of guy is Bill Maher behind the scenes? |-| 
|-| cnusie6 || 3 || Do you think that the frustrations that influenced you to become a Radical are similar to the frustrations that drive people to Right wing parties today?  |-| 
|-| cnussel || 3 || Hello Maajid, I follow your work very closely and appreciate it, I have a few questions from South Asian perspective (I'm from India).

- Regarding the conservative culture in this subcontinent which has strict relation to religion and the politicians are willing to let it prosper for vote banks, do you think a reform of Islam is possible at the ground level? Especially in countries like India/Pakistan/Bangladesh? Low socio-economic level, high chance of being misguided by the Imams. (I am aware of Hindu conservatism but I see it being swept away with an irreligious wave as westernization happens, we can see the effects in Urban cities.)

- I am among the people who call themselves "new" atheists and speak up against religion(s) and believe that it's root of much evil in this world, what's your opinion on that?

- What's your take on anti-Muslim violence in some parts of Europe? Innocents are killed and I think it fuels extremism and gives the extremists something legit for their propaganda. |-| 
|-| cnusuzk || 6 || How do you feel about Europe's new right-leaning anti-islamism/anti-mass-immigration movements, such as the Danish People's Party and (more controversially) Pegida? To me, they seem mostly - with some notable exceptions especially in Eastern and Southern Europe - pretty moderate and inclusive (in the sense of, say, gay-friendliness and racial tolerance) compared to the "traditional" far-right. What do you make of them, and do you feel that the media has generally been fair in its portrayal of them? Do you think their concerns of the consequences of large-scale immigration have justification? Or do you see it as simply alarmism, hysteria, prejudice? How should decision-makers react to such concerns? |-| 
|-| cnusv8o || 3 || Do you think that individuals are radicalized in "Muslim countries" in much the same way as they are radicalized in the UK? 

Do you think minority status makes it easier/harder/different/same in terms of creating Islamists?  |-| 
|-| cnusvco || 4 || Regarding Islamic Texts:
How do you engage with someone who is relying on a direct quote of the Qur'an eg 9.5 http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=9&amp;verse=5 to justify backward &amp; unacceptable things, in this case Offensive Warfare.

I get that people can &amp; do cherry pick, especially if they have only recieved a fragmented exposure to their religion, but when they have the sources to back them up - don't you have to discredit the text in some way? How does that conversation go?

The best I could do is point out that to support Offensive Warfare is to compel others to commit genocide on Muslims. And I get NO response to this. |-| 
|-| cnusyoj || 5 || What's your opinion on, islam critics such as Richard dawkins, sam harris and christopher hitchens?

How is your current relationship with Tommy Robinson ?

What is your opinion on reza asian?

Do you know the The Young Turks, have you thought of having an interview with them?  |-| 
|-| cnut5jj || 6 || Why do I have to pay so much? :( |-| 
|-| cnut74u || 3 || Why do you think there aren't more genuinely moderate, liberal Muslims speaking up in the media? It seems like you're the go-to guy these days for a voice of reason with a Muslim face (in the UK at least)?

What can be done to empower more to speak up? |-| 
|-| cnut91x || 6 || Are we already in so advanced future that LaForge is able to see again or what? |-| 
|-| cnutagp || -3 || Please tell me your not religious anymore?
 
I'm an atheist and I know and it's even a worldwide fact that religion is the disease that will end all life on earth. 
 
Every war on this planet that has ever been or will be has always been and will be around fucking religion.
 
 
If I could change one thing in the world it would be to destroy religion and banish it from the whole universe and galaxy.  
 
So that everyone would be a non believer an atheist in other words.
 
Now tell me Mr are you still religious and if you could change 1 thing in the world what would it be?  
 
 Edit: fuck you all you religious asshole I hope you all get murdered and raped when while you watch all your loved ones being raped and cut in pieces you fucking religious assholes fuck you all I also have questions for religious mother fuckers so downvoting me will only proof what for piece of shit you religious mother fuckers are you fucking assholes  |-| 
|-| cnutdip || 3 || Maajid, thank you so much for what you are doing!

I am not a believer, although I come from a muslim family. I really agree with you that there are blasphemy taboos within the muslim world and communities. Even my very secular father has issues with the Rushdies and the Vilks. 

On to my question. Many of my muslim friends are hard core anti-blasphemy crusaders. I understand that you were one yourself some time ago. What was your breaking point? I know it is difficult to explain reasons of ones thoughts and behavior, but was there an idea that made it impossible to continue being an islamist? Something that all of us could use in this war of ideas? |-| 
|-| cnutdwz || 3 || Hello Maajid! I'm in the middle of your book and finding it both surprising and engrossing. 

Your description of Islamism as you encountered it is that of an ideology that attempts to supersede racial identity with religious identity, effectively dividing the world into Muslims and everyone else. [Seth Ackerman argues in this statistically dense article](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/01/community-standards/) that western writers and politicians on the left and right have made the same mistake by "essentializing Muslims," and portraying them only as either unwelcome invaders or as victims of imperialism. 

Is it possible that such essentialism unwittingly reinforces the rhetoric of groups like Hizb ut-Tahrir, and how can writers and politicians counter the impulse to oversimplify the opinions of such a diverse demographic? Thanks kindly. |-| 
|-| cnutegf || 5 || Maajid, as a Muslim, I am proud of the work you're doing in the muslim community however, I do not understand why some moderate Muslims are against your work and find what you're doing a kind of "blasphemy"? |-| 
|-| cnuto1v || 3 || Hi Maajid, Kilburn resident and undecided voter here. If elected in May, how would your position (in either coalition government or opposition) be a better one from which to counter fundamentalism &amp; extremism than your time currently spent as a campaigner? |-| 
|-| cnutv3f || 14 || Maajid this is so weird i've literally been watching so many videos of you in debates recently! I just want to say, as a very committed secularist, I think what you are doing is amazing. Giving an unfaltering voice of moderate Islam is a rare and extremely important thing for our country.

My question is this:

In the BBC3 "Free speech" debates last year you went to bat for gay Muslims strongly, saying that the Koran and other holy texts advocate at times horrible things, like slavery, which we have (obviously) abandoned as barbaric practices.

However how liberally can you interpret the Koran, or other holy texts, before you are really just reading what you want to see, and not what is there? In these cases, is the intellectually honest thing to do, to abandon the philosophy of (X religion), rather than trying to make the square peg of religion fit the round hole of modern society?

How far can one stray from the orthodoxy of Islam in the name of liberal democracy, before you are no longer really a Muslim?

Sorry if thats a bit long winded! Big fan. |-| 
|-| cnuu1gp || 4 || What's so special about an app with books in it? Isn't that what Kindle does? Many (most?) libraries offer eBook apps at this point (and they're free) so I'm not seeing the attraction here. |-| 
|-| cnuu1w3 || 29 || Off topic but the thought just occurred to me... I wonder how much Reading Rainbow and other shows for kids might have had to do with combating racism in the US.

I grew up in very white area, and as a small child just never encountered anyone who wasn't white. I knew that people with other skin colors were out there somewhere, I'd occasionally see someone at the grocery store or the mall, but I didn't know or think anything about them. I never was in a class with a black kid until I was 9 years old (she was kinda awesome, the only girl I knew who was into video games).

But anyway, the only exposure I had to knowing what black people are like was from LeVar Burton on Reading Rainbow, and Gordon on Sesame Street. It was from these shows that I learned "oh ok, they're exactly the same as us white people, they just happen to look different". |-| 
|-| cnuu6ly || 3 || Any of the [Jimmy Corrigan](http://designarchives.aiga.org/assets/images/000/000/570/570_lg.jpg) books are a good example of a cover giving a pretty good example of what to find inside.  |-| 
|-| cnuu8x1 || 3 || Did anyone get their t shirts from backing them on kick starter? I kept getting email saying that packages were being sent out, but I never got mine. |-| 
|-| cnuubst || 12 || Not at all a big fan of this. 

Mostly because it's gone from PBS (which is non-profit and funded by donations) to being a for-profit company that will only give it's material to some schools. The vast majority have to pay.

It's a for-profit business using the name of a non-profit from our childhoods to make money.

That's fucked up. |-| 
|-| cnuulr7 || 5 || Will my $9.99 a month get me more Kunta Kinte? If so I will buy.   |-| 
|-| cnuvhhf || 3 || With the free Overdrive app you can get free books for your kids as long as you have a US library card. There are also audio books. 

Hoopla has audio books, music and movies. Hoopla is also free with a library card. |-| 
|-| cnuzswf || 7 || I'm going to take an educated guess and say that almost all of the opposition to this book is being driven by Fox News conservatives. |-| 
|-| cnv19vw || 7 || It is a great idea. It would also be an incredibly fun place for them to put other book recommendations. Then you could walk around with a little pre-made book shopping list.   |-| 
|-| cnv1m5v || 75 || It was very good, and I don't have ready rebuttal, but that feels a little over blown to me. |-| 
|-| cnv1png || 3 || here is the book on goodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/297673.The_Brief_Wondrous_Life_of_Oscar_Wao |-| 
|-| cnv1u9q || 16 || It "totally rocks" is what passes for insightful criticism now. Give me a break. A hugely overrated writer.  |-| 
|-| cnv26cn || 4 || Given that the complainant offered up a series of alternative books that are all riddled with "conservative" tropes, it seems strongly likely that the attack is politically motivated. 

Here's the text from her complaint:

"If English teachers want to teach global poverty and economic equality, she suggested alternate books: Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse, We the Living by Ayn Rand and America the Beautiful by Ben Carson."

All of these books she recommends have a very distinct "flavor".

"We the Living" does a nice job of making poverty the fault of the government.  I mean is Ayn Rand writing about Soviet Russia...

"From the Dust" ends with the impoverished girl learning to be ok with her lot in life...After pointing out that New Deal programs didn't really help and that her father's bad choices along with a serious of stupid mistakes by the family were the ultimate cause of their suffering. 

And "America the Beautiful: Rediscovering What Made This Nation Great" is an unknown to me, but it's sold by Zondervann, promoted on CBN, and has a name that is hilariously similar to Steven Colbert's last satire, all lead me to believe it's more of the same.

This is politics plain and simple.  |-| 
|-| cnv2dwd || 42 || I think this is a great book, but nowhere near the best of the 21st century. I'd certainly put 2666 over it.  |-| 
|-| cnv2fop || 8 || It's still early in the century, lol! I still thought Diaz' book was profoundly good. Playful and exciting prose and a heart rending story. 

Also, I am happy to see that I have read some of the other books on the list. Sometimes I think that I'm stuck in the late 20th century in books. I guess I'm staving off my irrelevance... |-| 
|-| cnv2fv4 || 41 || I was underwhelmed by it.  There were sections that were moving and insightful...and then sections where I was actually a little bored with it.  I don't know what I'd put as the best novel of the century, but it wouldn't be this. |-| 
|-| cnv2oei || 4 || Although I loved this novel, my personal pick would be Glen David Gold's *Sunnyside*. |-| 
|-| cnv4kef || 24 || hm, I was extremely underwhelmed by the book :(

Anyone have aby thoughts on why it's so highly regarded |-| 
|-| cnv5nac || 4 || I enjoyed it, but there is no way in hell I would even consider putting it ahead of A Visit from the Goon Squad or The Corrections. |-| 
|-| cnv5tl9 || 3 || I just finished this last week and it is still on my mind. I admittedly didn't know much about the history of the Dominican Republic, and reading the book has inspired me to learn more. I liked the magical realism parts - it reminded me a lot of reading *One Hundred Years of Solitude*. I also liked the insight it gave me to what it means to be an immigrant in America, or to be a first-generation citizen that speaks English as a second language. There were things I didn't like, though. I felt like there were gaps in the narrative. A few of the family deaths were glossed over while some were discussed in great detail. And the narrator was unlikeable, and at times so were Oscar, and his mother, and even his sister. Not that it is necessarily a flaw to have unlikeable characters. The characters are definitely complicated.  |-| 
|-| cnv6g3p || 6 || Man, is this book really good?  I tried to read it a few years ago and I had to put it down.  I rarely quit books, but the narrator was so annoying and I just didn't care about the story.  But maybe I should have stuck it out. |-| 
|-| cnv6x5s || 9 || 2666, as someone mentioned below. But also The Road would be on my list. Not McCarthy's best but it is an incredibly powerful book. Also, Coetzee's Disgrace, which was published in 1999, should generally be noted as a best book of the past 20 years at least.  |-| 
|-| cnv8p47 || 41 || Literally any book they chose would have resulted in a bunch of "meh, I didn't think it was all that good, certainly not better than (insert other novel here)" comments. Personally, I adored Oscar Wao, but it's kind of pointless to get worked up about this kind of arbitrary list. Different strokes and all that. |-| 
|-| cnv8w9q || -3 || u don't need stupid ass charts to know jesus is a ripoff godammit you upvote mongerers make me wanna quit this sub |-| 
|-| cnvarhc || 6 || ...But then what would I do with my expired MetroCards? |-| 
|-| cnvcibp || 8 || I think it's far too early to tell, and the way the BBC titled this list is absolutely ridiculous. "Top novels since 2000" or some variation probably would have been better. Saying "the best of the century" will probably get a lot more hits, but like saying "my most difficult parts of the semester" two weeks in.

If we had asked in 1870 what the "Best Novels" of the Century were, we would still be making judgments on censored editions of *Moby-Dick* and *Wuthering Heights*, we would still be 15 years away from an English translation of *Crime and Punishment* (which was released in Russian in 1866), and 16 away from even an extremely flawed translation of *War and Peace* (1869). If anything, this list reeks of pure and dishonest Journalistic triumphalism. It's very likely we still have yet to read the "best novels", and many of them have yet to be noticed by the mainstream press of the last 15 years. |-| 
|-| cnvcq0x || 3 || Damn, i wish i had glasses. I miss reading. It hurts too much to read without glasses. |-| 
|-| cnvd7mv || 7 || If only all of James Patterson's books self-destructed... |-| 
|-| cnvdqw8 || 11 || I declare the drawing of a tree I did in my notebook during Managerial Economics the greatest piece of visual art of the 21st century so far. |-| 
|-| cnvel7r || 3 || Ooh how about Matthew McConaughey [here](http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=Matthew+McConaughey&amp;FORM=R5FD2&amp;crslsl=0#view=detail&amp;id=DB7E03AC666221803BA6A9C0E451E44170127B9D&amp;selectedIndex=70)

dimples and all :) |-| 
|-| cnveuzm || 5 || I just finished The Goldfinch, haven't read anything else by her. I liked it, but the "depression" I felt was more of a homesickness she created. I was homesick for Hobbies shop. I loved how she was able to make me see and smell all the furniture.  |-| 
|-| cnvf846 || 4 || "Declared" eh |-| 
|-| cnvfz0z || 9 || I have the opposite problem, I have a vivid imagination for faces in stories, but if I get a hint of what the character *might* look like in movies before I start the book, I lose that face entirely.

For example, I started "Horns" after watching the trailer for it, and despite the descriptions I read about him in the book, my mind just filled in Daniel Radcliffe. 

Edit: Oops I just realized you asked a question, I'm imagining a post-N'sync transitioning [Justin Timberlake](http://www.glamour.com/beauty/blogs/girls-in-the-beauty-department/0301-justin-timberlake-curly-hair_bd.jpg).  |-| 
|-| cnvi6jp || 5 || I think Donna Tartt is one of the most stylish writers around at the moment.  Her sentences flow effortlessly, and like you say OP, she builds her scenes with amazing clarity and detail.  

I mean, I've never led a semi-feral life in Las Vegas with a Russian friend called Boris, but that part of the book is so vivid in my memory it feels as if in some strange sense that I have.  

Having said that though, I think that her talent might also be a weakness.  I've read all three of her novels and aside from The Secret History, for me, her other two books are a touch too long - as if because she's so good at writing, she can't help but add a little bit more than is necessary.

[edit: 'The Secret History' not 'A Secret History'] |-|

|-| cnvjls2 || 4 || &gt;a first edition of Gulliver's travels

 |-| 
|-| cnvjy6g || 5 || Book characters are a bit like characters in dreams to me. They always seem to have faces, but then when I really try to look at their face in my mind's eye it sorta blurs out and I can't quite remember what it looked like before I started thinking too hard about it... |-| 
|-| cnvl3bh || 12 || I just imagine everyone with Steve Buscemi face. Jack Reacher? 6'4",  300 pounds, blond Steve Buscemi. Ender Wiggins? Child Steve Buscemi. Roland Deschain? Cowboy Steve Buscemi  |-| 
|-| cnvrbzi || 3 || Funny how all of the contenders are lit fic. It's weird how people insist on thinking that the most lasting art always comes from "approved" or "respectable" genres even though we know otherwise. |-|

|-| cnvtchj || 3 || The Secret History killed me, and not in a good way. She says in 500 pages what could be said in 300 or less... or none. Because there was no character development in that book. They all started out privileged and entitled (or at least, acted like it, in the main character's circumstances), and ended privileged and entitled. Sure, maybe one or two of them were warped like that, but ALL of them? Nope. 

That's not to say she's not a good writer. She is. I just think I chose the wrong book of hers for my introduction to her. |-| 
|-| cnvwmnu || 46 || Writing a series of this magnitude would be so challenging. |-|

|-| cnvx2ns || 28 || This is so cool! very interesting. I always respected how many subplots are in the HP books, but this actually makes it look pretty simple. JK Rowling was very meticulous in the order of events in the books.

|-| cnvzbkt || 4 || What the hell is "over plotting"?  So because she didn't type it all out in 3 Benzedrine fueled months like some lady-Kerouac it is "over plotting"?

|-| cnx7om6 || 27 || Even after the invention of printing in the 15th Century, books were expensive and rare, so reading aloud was the best way to share them. According to *The Time Traveller’s Guide to Medieval England* by Ian Mortimer, before printing, books were read only by the rich, with reading-parties (usually of ladies), the early precursors of modern book groups. They would share by reading aloud.

As late as the 19th Century, writers like Dickens expected his (serialised) novels to be read aloud. They were written with this in mind, and he performed them in public until shortly before his death. |-|

|-| cnx9z3d || 3 || The Watch series by Sergei Lukyanenko.  I got the first one on a bookstore employee's recommendation.  Had to buy the next two the next day because I couldn't put them down.  Learned there was a fourth book - only available in Russian at the time.  Half-seriously considered learning Russian to read it.  Considered it again when the fifth came out.

I wish more of Lukyanenko's work was translated to English. |-|

|-| cnxadti || 7 || Great novel. Highly recommended to all. |-| 
|-| cnxag28 || 3 || Thanks for the recommendation, I'll read it next
 |-| 
|-| cnxaml3 || 185 || It is indeed a very interesting book, I just thought the characters lacked ~~debt~~ depth...  but then again they didn't really need to be.  I enjoyed it in the same way I enjoyed jurassic park or the davinci code, a good page turner, but not especially memorable.

The difference between this and another survival story: robinson crusoe, is mostly about character depth and development.  You care about Crusoe in that book, but you care about *how* Watney makes it in the martian. |-| 
|-| cnxaqay || 5 || To be fair, that was probably just due to the spelling and typography making it difficult to skim in your head.

Take an unabridged version of text from the  1400s, like the Canterbury Tales, preferably not in a modern typeface, and try reading it now. Unless you read it aloud with the right accent and cadence, its very hard to tell what it says, the cognitive load is high. |-| 
|-| cnxbh86 || 9 || It was good but I didn't think it was mind blowingly amazing.  I couldn't stand the main characters personality.  It just seemed unrealistic for the situation he was in and how old he was yet I was constantly intrigued by the stuff he came up with.  Really, the character development was the only thingI dislike in the book, but that's a pretty big thing to me.  No one besides the main character was developed, and the main character acted like a 16 year old the whole time.  I think it would have been better if the book was a bit darker.  Like after something bad happens to the main character, have him flash back to childhood memories or something, not joke about the situation. |-| 
|-| cnxbkvn || 14 || Having also listened to the audiobook, I loved it. The voice acting really adds some of the depth that a lot of people seemed to not find in the secondary characters. Being an chemical engineer, I found the problem solving aspects absolutely captivating.

**Disclaimer:** Don't read too much into any spoilery nature in the following paragraph. None of it hints at anything in this book.

For anyone that doesn't feel the same suspense, particularly about survival of characters, I have a suggestion. Read the entire A Song of Ice and Fire series. You will never not be afraid of characters dying ever again. |-| 
|-| cnxblzb || 128 || Also, did anyone else find the most unrealistic thing about this book that CNN only had a half hour program? |-|

|-| cnxc4hb || 3 || That's a really good thing. |-| 
|-| cnxcpgg || 3 || It was a pretty good book. I didn't really like the ending though. By the end of the book I was like Well how is he gonna get out of it this time and of course he does. I'm all for happy endings but it would have been more realistic and emotional if he had just died. |-| 
|-| cnxcts2 || 6 || I really enjoyed it. Not very many books have made me go between, "heck yeah!" And "oh shit!" So quickly. I do wish the main character had more depth. It felt like he was just a funny guy in a crummy situation, when It needed to be more of a funny guy in a DIRE situation. I wish I had known more about his life on earth and more of went on in his head. It made it unbelievable that a year later this guy was still telling so many jokes on Mars. I liked how the science-y  parts were occasionally broken up with humor, it made the story more entertaining. It just needed a little more. I'd give it a 7/10.  |-| 
|-| cnxcw0t || 3 || A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin.  We just want the next book damn it! |-| 
|-| cnxd7xr || 4 || The Eyes of the Dragon. It's a well written fantasy story, easy enough to process that a kid can read it, but compelling enough that an adult can love it as well. A lot of people will disregard how good it is because of who the author is, and as a result don't give it a chance. I have bought at least five copies of this book, because I lend it out and it never comes back.   |-| 
|-| cnxdqrn || 36 || It was a fun page-turner, but wouldn't call it amazing. Reminded me (for obvious reasons) of Ben Bova's *Mars* in some ways, but with very flat characters - partially a result of the premise (one person alone on Mars doesn't provide a chance for a whole lot of interaction), but even the parts taking place on Earth the characters weren't very interesting. Also, everything was just a little too pat. No real tension between any of the characters, the one administrator who dares nay-say The Plan is easily dismissed with no real tension or discussion. A *very* idealized version of NASA is presented - which is fine, as it isn't the focus of the book, but it just felt like it lacked a lot of depth.

It was fun to read the inventive ways Watney surmounted the problems he faced, but the question always seemed to be *how* he was going to be rescued, not *whether* he was going to be rescued. But it accomplished everything it set out to accomplish, and was a lot of fun along the way. |-|

|-| cnxei5r || 5 || I very much enjoyed it. His humor is on par with mine, and I found myself highlighting bits of text way more often than I usually do (usually because it made me giggle.)

I was slightly disappointed with the abrupt ending, but overall, I was enthralled through the entire book. I finished it in just under 2.5 days.  |-| 
|-| cnxey9f || 8 || You are gonna love it! Just a tip though, order A Wise Man's Fear now instead of waiting til you're done with this one! |-| 
|-| cnxf2hr || 4 || Was there a reason for the ban? They were allowed books before so i can only imagine it's because of sneaking stuff in? |-| 
|-| cnxf42b || 22 || Am I the only one who thought this book was total trash? I couldn't wait for it to be over. In fact, was hoping the main character would die just so it would be. Easily the worst book I've read in 10 years. Not even close. 

There was zero character development, like none at all. I didn't care about the welfare of anyone. I got to the point that I was just trying to breeze through pages just to get done. 

Worst of all, I thought the main character, the guy I'm supposed to believe is an astronaut, had the maturity level of a 13-year-old. He wrote like one, basically every chapter was "I nearly died. The ship blew up. BOO! I can make potatoes. YAH! Let's watch bad 80s TV."

So tremendously bad. 

I could see how it would be better in audio or as a movie. But the book, I don't get the love at all. 



 |-| 
|-| cnxf4gb || 7 || Also love this book. Every single cultural reference rang true for me as I must be the same age as the author. Heard a rumor it is being turned into a film and that he is working on Ready Player Two. |-| 
|-| cnxf4m1 || 14 || I absolutely hated it. It was unspeakably boring as nothing ever really happens. I can see why all the publishers rejected it for so long. Definitely in the top three worst novels I have ever read in my life. (and I love sci-fi and tech)  |-| 
|-| cnxf9gz || 5 || Wonderful book. Listened to the audio version which is well read, too.  Almost want to read it again already! |-| 
|-| cnxfbea || 65 || Repost of a comment last time this book was discussed here (an entire 9 days ago):

My reaction to this book swung nearly 180 degrees while reading it. For the first third I loved it and was recommending it to everybody, but by the end I really disliked it, had come to view it as mediocre and had stopped recommending it.

Though I enjoyed the engineering and the premise, the characterization was godawful. I got progressively more disbelieving that such a juvenile, semi-autistic character would have been selected for NASA for a space flight. It seemed like a nerdy IT redditor's conception of how normal people behave and talk. This is what made me really start cringing through the middle of the book. 

The worst problem for me was that the lead character had no emotional life. His total lack of any real grief, despair or introspection, *ever*, started to break my suspension of disbelief. There's a lot of research showing that normal human beings suffer extreme psychological trauma when kept in solitary confinement like he was; it distorts the psyche remarkably. But the protagonist really showed no believable effects of such extreme loneliness and isolation. It's as if the author doesn't even understand that being isolated from all humanity for over a year might affect a normal person in any way.

Also the protagonist had a habit of talking in juvenile slang and wisecracking his way through everything. To a certain extent I can see dark humor being realistic, but this wasn't executed well enough to feel like dark humor - it felt like, again, an IT guy who's trying to be a writer and still saying "yay" all the time because he thinks it comes across as edgy and irreverent, but it actually comes across as weirdly juvenile and also out-of-character. He's supposed to be a biologist and a NASA guy; I'm a biologist myself and pretty nerdy, but you snap the hell out of that kind of juvenalia in grad school. You learn to have a professional persona. Same with NASA types, they've been trained out of that crap and they stay 100% professional when on mission, even when it's a disaster and they're dying. Especially during communication. It got so I wanted to throw the book across the room every time I hit a "Yay."

Writing-wise it was stiff and flat prose. Competent enough in terms of conveying pieces of information - "and then I did X and then I did Y and then I did Z" - but not in terms of evoking any deeper emotions, or sense of place, or any sense of lyricism. The book is largely written like an engineering manual. But those X-Y-Z engineering-manual sequences can only sustain my interest for just so long. By the last third of the book I no longer really cared about the exact number of solar panels on his little car, or their efficiency, or the precise blow-by-blow details of how he cut through some panel or other. By the last few chapters I was just flipping past pages and pages about solar panels just to see how it finished.

(If I am allowed one last rant: HE MESSED UP THE BOTANY. Supposedly he's a great botanist and he saves himself by growing potatoes, but he messed up a few things about how potatoes grow.) |-|

|-| cnxfkjs || 6 || Ugh. I do not get what people liked about this book. The two dimensional lead character and repetitive structure made me want to pull my hair out.

1. Oh no, disaster happened I'm totally fucked!
2. Ok, I think I've figured out how to fix it.
3. Well, that didn't work exactly the way I planned but I fixed it anyway.

|-| cnxfl54 || 5 || I'm currently reading it right now! Love what I've read so far. Looking forward to the movie at the end of the year.  |-| 
|-| cnxfloq || 10 || I honestly don't see why this book is given the praise it has been.  The writing is terrible, the character development is worse.  I agree, it absolutely was a page turner and I even made it over halfway through despite cringing over the writing the whole way through.  The plot was interesting, but that doesn't make for a good book.  |-| 
|-| cnxfo55 || 9 || [CAUTION: SPOILERS] As an engineering student I absolutely loved the book, since I could relate to the way he solved problems. I was impressed with the way Weir managed to keep my attention grasped, considering how dry the plot could have been (pun intended). My main complaint was the ending of the book. I really would have appreciated some closure when the team gets back to Earth and gets to see their families.  |-| 
|-| cnxfvgv || 3 || Our word for reading comes from the Old English "raedan" (yes I know I missed the aesch, but I'm on mobile so please bear with me). When books were a rare luxury commodity (and complex to make), reading was understood as a communal activity centered around the telling of a story, song, or riddle (like the stories around the fire in the hall Heorot from Beowulf). Listeners would then respond and participate in the ensuing discussion. The practice as a whole was called "reading" and the concept remained in English culture through the middle ages - Chaucer's Canterbury Tales were "read" in Richard II's court in a similar fashion. Silent reading was not a common practice, but not completely alien.

 |-| 
|-| cnxg2cn || 5 || I really enjoyed The Martian, really funny and the scientific basis was a nice shift from the hand-waving that seems to happen a lot in SciFi novels. It left me wishing there was an epilogue of some sort at the end, though that's mostly me wishing there was more to read. |-| 
|-| cnxg3hs || 7 || A lot of people seem to really like this series. Maybe I'm the oddball out, but I didn't like this book. I found it very long and drawn out and was so happy when it was over. Glad you are enjoying it though!   |-| 
|-| cnxg41u || 5 || I still can't get over this book, I read it a while ago and I got everyone I knew to read it, I need to read it again. I was chasing the euphoria this book had given me and it ended up leading me to Enders Game and the whole series of that was also good. I am still looking for anything to bring me close to Ready Player One. This book made me read a lot of other books hoping they were similar. |-| 
|-| cnxg4gu || 6 || I can't imagine a book more laser-focused to appeal to the typical STEM-loving redditor.

I didn't love it.  Seemed almost pandering to that demographic. |-| 
|-| cnxg9s2 || 5 || Really liked the book. Best part for me was how it got into lots of engineering details, while still being very fun to read. I didn't pay much attention to character development and all that usual stuff, because the engineering was so great. Well, not scientifically perfect, but entertaining. Might be just my own experience, but looks like this kind of scifi was popular in the 70s and 80s, and then there was almost zero of the technical stuff and everything about the boring social interactions. |-|

I'm at uni studying Spacecraft Engineering so it was really good to see how accurate the book was from the scientific perspective.

Anyway, I loved it and cannot wait for the film! |-| 
|-| cnxh5i0 || 8 || Good example of a stupid book with a silly premise that is an enormous amount of fun. When I got to the end, I wanted to go back and read it again. 

Basically the opposite of The Martian.  |-| 
|-| cnxhd2p || 113 || As an engineer I found this book absolutely enthralling, I lost serious sleep from being unable to put it down. While the overall plot was fairly predictable the turns it took along with the creativity and accurate scientific detail of the main characters solutions was captivating. 

Solving tricky problems with limited resources is what engineering is all about and this book totally nailed it. The subject matter being so close to home is likely what enabled me to overlook the "poor quality of the prose" as is referenced in other comments here. 

I really don't think this book intended to go out there and be an exemplary piece of literary genius, I think it went out to tell a great story to a target audience. If you didn't like it perhaps you should consider yourself not a member of said audience :)

Edit: Found some quotes that were so memorable I wrote them down. "my asshole is doing more to keep me alive than my brain" and "Brought product to surface of Mars, it stopped working. 0/10" Gold |-| 
|-| cnxhgos || 3 || Oh I absolutely loved it, totally a thrill book with wonderful detail. I'm even looking forward to the film, because I think it could be a great one.  |-| 
|-| cnxhkh1 || 3 || I loved this book.  It was a little dry when it came to the science portions but overall extremely humorous and exciting.   |-| 
|-| cnxhm2y || 4 || One of the best books of the past year, and in my top 10 SF books ever.  Excellent read.  Can't wait to see what he comes up with next. |-| 
|-| cnxhmoj || 7 || I loved both of the books, but, coincidentally, hated kvothe.. I thought he was a pompous know it all. However, I loved all the secondary characters, the world, back story, how magic works, blah blah. I pretty much loved every aspect the book except kvothe. 

Definitely order the 2nd book so you don't have to wait, you'll want to tear through it just as much. 

Rothfuss needs to get his ass in gear for the third one. |-| 
|-| cnxhyub || 5 || I talk about Vladimir Nabokov all the time, especially to people who don't know much about him other than that he wrote Lolita. So they're especially weirded out because they think he's a child molester or something. Which can be a bit discouraging. I'm reading his love letters to his wife right now and they are the cutest things ever, though. |-| 
|-| cnxi9eg || 4 || Agreed. My favorite read last year.  |-| 
|-| cnxik59 || 24 || One of the most entertaining opening lines I've read. It's simple and silly but I enjoyed the laugh I got from the beginning. 

"I'm pretty much fucked. That's my considered opinion. Fucked." |-| 
|-| cnxisl0 || 6 || The story is very good, but I enjoyed the texture of the book even more. We're enjoying the story as told by the protagonist, and the protagonist has his own motivations for coloring the story to suit his audience. When Kvothe says that he did something, or that another character did something, what we are reading is his 
"version" of the events in his life. With glimpses of his behavior as the innkeep, which is written objectively and not subjectively, we can form an opinion of Kvothe. When we are reading his narrative of his own adventures, we are reading his opinion of himself. When a hero tells his pupil how he became a hero, is he telling the truth, or a version of the truth that makes him seem more heroic.....
I love these books. Can't wait for the next one. I don't think it would make a very good movie unless given the full HBO or Peter Jackson treatment.  |-| 
|-| cnxiukj || 3 || I liked Koontz as a teenager but began to roll my eyes at his novels as I got older. I picked up Odd Thomas when I was a young adult and couldn't put it down. The Odd series is his best work and it's been a fun journey.  |-| 
|-| cnxivq6 || 8 || Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy. A few years ago I made it a few chapters in but gave up. It's just so daunting. |-| 
|-| cnxj11d || 4 || Loved it. It was the fastest I've ever read an entire novel, it was in two sittings over two days. I can't wait for the movie. |-| 
|-| cnxj5xe || 7 || My Goodreads review: 

&gt;Extremely entertaining read. Written in a way that makes the entire ordeal seem actually possible. 

&gt;I'd love to see the main character in another book because all his parts are hilarious and fun to read. 

&gt;This isn't a life changing book, but it's one hell of a tale of resourcefulness and trust-in-science.  |-| 
|-| cnxj6ai || 3 || The Brothers Karamazov, Infinite Jest, The Corrections... There's no reason for it, but sometimes the door stopping size combined with the pressure of books I SHOULD read, makes me not want to read them. I'm going to read Karamazov this year. Yes. 

Probably. |-| 
|-| cnxj7bj || 8 || The range of opinions on this book are really odd. I actually really loved this book and it amazes me that others could hate it so strongly. |-| 
|-| cnxjejp || 3 || Absolutely LOVED this audio book. The voice actor added an element that I feel just wouldn't have come across had I read the actual hard copy. I couldn't put it down! Loved every moment of this book. |-| 
|-| cnxjjqm || 6 || Very much liked it. Fast moving and interesting. There was no hand-waving on the methods used to survive. Full explanations.

|-| cnxl1gu || -3 || As soon as I finished it, I listened to the whole thing again. Loved it. 

What I hate is reading this thread expecting to find an intelligent discussion of the book, but instead discovering that most of the people commenting here are sad little people who have endured so much shit in their lives that they're not able to enjoy a far-fetched story of survival at impossible odds illustrating the unquenchable human desire to survive. But the thing that irks me the most is that the bitter commenters feel it's okay to openly invalidate the years of hard work that the author put into creating this book. 

If any of you have published a best-seller that's being turned into a movie with Matt Damon starring, please let me know and I'll sincerely apologize. |-|

|-| cnxlkfo || 3 || The audio book was PERFECTION. I listened to it twice. |-| 
|-| cnxlm9y || 3 || I also read this book and found it to be a pretty good story, however the ending was pretty disappointing as I expected him to reveal further of what happened to Mark after he landed back on Earth. |-| 
|-| cnxlqxz || 4 || Awesome audiobook!!  |-| 
|-| cnxlru3 || 3 || "I AM FUCKED AND I'M GOING TO DIE!" 

I laughed so hard at that part.  |-| 
|-| cnxm8av || 3 || Honestly, huge dissappointment for me. I was raised on adventure books like Robinson Crusoe and the Mysterious Island, so this genre is especially significant for me. 
Andy Weir put extaraordinary men (at least, the main character is supposed to be one) into extraordinary circumstances and what did he get? Some absolutely banal and common reactions - shits, fucks and moaning and grumbling. 
Robinson Crusoe is the story about how survival changes the person. The Martian is the brief instruction how to survive on Mars.  |-| 
|-| cnxmwcw || 4 || such an overrated book... The whole book is just clever problem solving, never once does he get stuck or freak out, or anything he's just witty and clever and knows exactly what to do.  so boring |-| 
|-| cnxn0y6 || 3 || Very much enjoyed it. As several other commenters have pointed out, the characters lacked much depth... but despite the amount of explanatory text, it kept pace up well. It reminded me of a lot of the Asimov and Clarke that I used to read growing up - which probably made me more fond of it than I would have been otherwise. |-| 
|-| cnxn2l9 || 3 || I really like the book except I feel like he overlooked the psychological damage of being alone in space without any contact for months. |-| 
|-| cnxnf17 || 3 || As an Mechanical Engineer, I absolutely loved this book. I also listened to the audio book and I thought R. C. Bray's narration was excellent. I only recommend it to my friends who would enjoy the engineering/math aspect as I know it would be too tiresome for others. 

As for the all the people complaining that Whitney doesn't have enough emotional response or depression due to isolation, go read Game of Thrones if you're looking for that dark, gritty experience. I'm glad to read a book about a hero who also happens to be an engineer. |-|

I only hang onto ones I really want someone else to read, but I won't give such a book to anyone. It has to be someone I think that book is well tailored for. And if a book blows me away but I can't think of a friend it would suit, then I'll keep it until I meet the right person!
Books I have currently waiting for the right new owner include:

**Kill Your Friends, by John Niven**, for someone who likes things on the distasteful side of dark, who also has a good grounding in Britpop.

**City of Thieves, by David Benioff**, for someone open to YA, who'd appreciate a super-slick tale about friendship

**The Star of the Sea, by Joseph O'Connor** (Sinead's brother!), for someone who can see beyond the Historical Fiction tag, who'd enjoy a vivid story full of ideas

|-| cnxo5ob || 3 || “I once read the sentence 'I lay awake all night with a toothache, thinking about the toothache an about lying awake.' That's true to life. Part of every misery is, so to speak, the misery's shadow or reflection: the fact that you don't merely suffer but have to keep on thinking about the fact that you suffer. I not only live each endless day in grief, but live each day thinking about living each day in grief.”

|-| cnxonmv || 3 || I often do. I just make sure I bookmark where I stopped listening before I start trying to go to sleep &amp; set a timer so it turns off. I know I don't take much of it in at that point so I have to re-listen to anything played beyond that point.

|-| cnxqbzv || 4 || Yup before I went to college, I got rid of all my "baby" &amp; young-adult/teen books by donating them. I kept a few books that I had either annotated in (for school: like Frankenstein) or ones that were especially dear to me (about 4 or 5). 

Since then I've started buying books 2nd hand (or renting them from the library) and if they have a real impact on me, I buy the hard-cover copy and keep it in my new collection.  |-| 
|-| cnxr6o5 || 3 || I started listening to this book two days ago. I'm addicted to it! There was a lot of research and thought that went into this book. I normally read sci-fi/fantasy novels and this has been an awesome change of pace.  |-|

The months of hard training to overcome the difficulties? I just can feel that Rothfuss create a protagonist so OP that he just beat everyone at everything like he is already a level 100 character. I can continue for hours. The same happens with Jakis, a cliché of a bad guy.

Please someone explain to me what is my problem with Kvothe, because he just got in my nerves and never happened to me before to be against the "good guy" |-|

|-| cnxujvd || 9 || In middle school and my freshman year of high school I read various sorts of books, ranging from Tolkein to Potter. I got into drugs my sophomore year of high school and in my junior and senior years I started selling off my stuff, including my books. By the time I graduated I had sold all my books (and movies and anything else I could sell). What's crazy about this period is that no matter how bad I was fiending for more coke and was ripping off friends and selling fake stuff to acquaintances I NEVER sold any of my Calvin &amp; Hobbes comics - and I had every collection that had ever been released, even the big collections that were just the smaller collections combined. I was picking through carpets, smoking popcorn and breadcrumbs, pawning my gaming systems and CDs, etc etc etc, but I never touched my Calvin &amp; Hobbes books. I guess had I sold them I would have truly hit rock bottom.

In my sophomore year of college (clean for about a year and a half by then) I was enrolled in a mandatory religion class. We had to read Siddhartha by Herman Hesse. At that point my only exposure to "serious" lit (not sure what else to call it? classic lit?) was through high school English classes. Not an age in which I was receptive to that sort of literature. I devoured Stephen King and Philip K Dick novels and little else. I dreaded reading Siddhartha. It was short but I imagined it to be as boring as the books we were made to read in high school. I sat down to read it and I'm pretty sure I didn't get up again until I finished it. Absolutely loved it. It hit me on a deeper level than anything before it. I picked up the King novel I was reading at the time, Salem's Lot, but after a few pages I just felt flat and uninterested. I was craving another experience like I had had with Siddhartha. So starting with Hesse I made my way through the classic lit authors - Mann, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Faulkner, Salinger, etc. I couldn't get into Dick or King anymore. So I sold all my books except for those that hit me on that deeper level.

A couple years later I started to study Gandhi, and quickly I became obsessed and devoured his many writings and absorbed a lot of what he said into my own belief system. In a probably misguided effort to simply my life, to reduce my possessions, I got rid of a ton of books (and movies and clothes and so on), classics included. Which act later reminded me of the way I had been on drugs, selling everything, except now I was chasing my perfect self, i.e. no self, and I felt like art was in my way. After a couple years of failing my own ideal and feeling the irresistible pull of good literature again, I returned to the classics and read some I had missed before, like Proust and DFW, and fell in love with literature all over again. I regret selling so many good books now; I went out and bought some of them for the second time. I've built my library back up and have just recently started reading Philip K Dick again, enjoying his books for what they are, rather than hating them for what they're not. So of course I regret selling those too.

TL;DR: Sold my books three times and regretted it later every time. |-|

|-| cnxvq0r || 3 || Loved it.  Thought it was great, loved how it progressed, loved the situations and the resolutions. |-| 
|-| cnxvqrl || 3 || I must be one of the few that didn't like the Martian. I love science. I love fiction. I love science fiction. But I feel like in the Martian there was no balance between the science and the fiction. The fiction was just a vehicle to write about the science. When I see a science fiction book like that I get turned off right away. I think there was a good story in there somewhere, but there was too much missing in the way of characters and descriptive language and emotion for me to call it a good book. It had so much potential. I'm actually excited about the movie, because I think if some people who actually know how to tell a story get their hands on it they can make it into something closer to what it should have been. |-|

A few years back I felt desperately bad that I hadn't read any Chinese literature, so I committed to *The Story of Stone,* doing a hundred pages a night and was finished in two months, and found it much easier to get into other novels inspired by it. That's the nice part of literature being a web of references and influences; it won't be a giant mountain of unread stuff forever, and as you get used to the characteristics of literatures of certain languages, you begin to look forward and have a much easier time diving into other books from the same times or countries.

To be fair, there's definitely works here that I've never heard of, so cheers to Penguin for helping older works to come to light.

 |-| 
|-| cog8iav || 16 || Can anyone give a list of all the books?  |-| 
|-| cogdwfh || 15 || Of the 80 titles listed, several of them that i recognized appeared to be titled excerpts and not whole books. "Circe and the Cyclops" by Homer (*The Odyssey*), "The Dolphins, the Whales and the Gudgeon" by Aesop (*Aesop's Fables*), "The Wife of Bath" by Geoffrey Chaucer (*The Canterbury Tales*), etc.

I don't know enough to say if they're all excerpts, and i couldn't figure out how to buy anything so i've no idea if they were just showing excerpts and when you buy you get the whole book, and i'm not even saying it's a scam - even as excerpts there's some good literature in here and it's a nice project. But yeah. Fair warning, you may not be buying a whole book. |-| 
|-| cog6gwo || 33 || Welp, looks like I'm gonna have to drop some money on these. I've got quite a few Penguin box sets. After scrolling through most of these titles it's awesome to find I own basically none of them. Penguin are so good at not republishing the same stuff that exists in other sets, it's actually amazing. If they cover the same writer it's always different material, and they avoid the most 'obvious' choices, spectacularly introducing you to lesser known yet still amazing writing.

&amp;nbsp;

Some of the sets I own:

This includes the purchase links for the UK, and some numerical information that I'm not sure what it is.  |-| 
|-| cogbyv4 || 14 || Can anyone PM me a link to the box set? I've only found one on amazon for £52 but it's not available until November 2015.

+1 for terrible website. I want to buy the box set, or even just all the individual books. |-| 
|-| cogbk82 || 4 || Would someone be able to post a link to actually purchasing these books? |-| 
|-| coges2g || 3 || That's only 1p per book!  |-|

I don't even know if Amazon ships here, will check and report  |-| 
|-| cogahu3 || 3 || Just bought them all |-| 
|-| cog7tyy || -14 || Selling books that are in the public domain should be criminal.

Take their list, hit up Project Gutenberg and read them all for free on the digital device of your choosing. |-| 
|-| cogf9c5 || -6 || How generous it is to sell books that are in the public domain..... |-| 
|-| cogv1yb || 51 || Joseph Campbell pretty much covered the same subject matter around the same time (1946-49). 1949 is when Campbell released "Hero with a thousand faces", a work of comparative mythology, in which he describes the archetype for the hero and his supporters (eg: the mother, a figure that helps the hero progress when faced with tremendous odds, etc).

Basically Campbell showed how all stories rely on a few basic story types and key character roles. |-| 
|-| cogu8xu || 61 || Kurt Vonnegut totally founded TV Tropes and didn't tell anybody. |-| 
|-| coguer8 || 11 || I think my favorite types of stories are the noir hardboiled detective novels, things like Raymond Chandler, Dashiel Hammett, some of Jonathan Lethem's books, or Blade Runner.  Like Hamlet, it's hard to tell good from bad a lot of the time.  It always starts with something bad happening (though not to our [anti]hero), and then shortly afterwards something worse, but then it gets confusing.  Sometimes we're sure something good happened, and then quickly find out that it was bad and have to reevaluate.  The opposite happens just as frequently, too, if not more.  Then, at the very end, there's something that we're pretty sure is good (though it's often bad for someone we cared about until a couple of pages before, often the female lead).  Though often we're not really fully sure if it's good or not, even at the end.  

Or maybe I'm making more of it than it is, and they're really just classic "man in hole" stories (certainly, I think some Dashiel Hammett's early works, like *the Red Harvest*, could probably best be graphed like that).   |-| 
|-| cogvn9h || 9 || A small additional note for anyone interested, he was later awarded his degree when a friend submitted his novel Cat Cradle as a thesis because he created a fully formed religion. |-| 
|-| cogr44o || 23 || This is my favorite repost, it pops up every time I find myself wanting to look at it again. |-| 
|-| cogxwtc || 8 || I could think of another type: it starts out average, then things are improving, then something bad happens and it goes all downhill from there (Requiem for a dream). |-| 
|-| cogok4z || 30 || This is so cool - thank you for finding and sharing!!!  |-| 
|-| cogxp77 || 18 || This always bothers me when it comes up, so I think I'll try to articulate why this is. I'm not an anthropologist so I won't speculate as to why this was rejected but as someone working in the English department I can tell you what issues I would raise.

The most glaring issue is the fact that it doesn't seem to engage with any previous work on the subject. People have been talking about dramatic structure for thousands of years and yet he doesn't mention anyone like Aristotle, Freytag, Propp, or as is usually mentioned in these threads, Campbell (three of these guys have fallen by the wayside; we might wonder why). This is akin to when one of those guys turns up at a philosophy department with their homespun TOE and expects to be given a doctorate. Maybe his proposal did engage with this stuff, but either way what he's saying is very similar to what has been said before.

Secondly, attributing everything that happens to 'fortune' is a mistake. It's okay with fairy tales or myths, but as soon as you try to talk about characters with agency it falls apart. Half the point of Hamlet is that it has a revenger who cannot act; Vonnegut acknowledges this, but then tosses it into the pile for things that are too complicated to fit. We can also put into that pile most novels that are more complicated than fairytales if we're not going to reduce their plots to the simplicity of fairytales. The other thing is that he's being flippant in a way you can be if you're a famous novelist but in a way that you can't be if you want to be an academic, so it's hard to tell  how he would reconcile these issues. Dividing narratives into good things that happen and bad things that happen is really too simplistic anyway: is Pip's acquisition of a fortune good or bad? Well, it allows him to become a gentleman but it also alienates him from his family. I don't think you can graph this sort of complexity, especially when it requires such a degree of interpretation.

This approach might be okay for someone who wants to get an idea of structure because they want to write a story (Campbell, for example, was widely used in Hollywood until quite recently, though I wonder if this is more a reflection on Hollywood than anything), but as analysis it's simplistic to the point of meaninglessness. I don't even think this has potential for expansion; people have engaged with this sort of idea before and it's always been found to be too reductive to be useful. |-| 
|-| cogsoe0 || 9 || First time seeing this. Very interesting, fantastic stuff. |-| 
|-| cogs58t || 19 || I always wondered what ASOIAF would look like plotted. It would look wild, with each POVs character's perceptions taken into account.  |-| 
|-| coh0fha || 7 || &gt;Vonnegut spelled out the main argument of his thesis in a hilarious lecture, where he also graphed some of the more common story types.

Okay, so NOT a "master's thesis". He wasn't getting a fucking Master's degree when he gave that lecture. Is it possible to not be completely moronic about this?

&gt;One of the most popular story types is what Vonnegut called “Man in Hole,” graphed here by designer Maya Eilam. 

One of the three types Vonnegut actually talked about, everything beyond that is complete BS. This Maya Eilam person is a moron who's trying to cash in on the sudden popularity of this youtube clip, and she's even added things Vonnegut never talked about, like old and new testament stories (complete BS), and the stupidest being the "Which Way is Up" story whose graph consists of a straight line, and we're meant to believe that's what Vonnegut saw Hamlet as? A straight line? Get the fuck out of here. I'd like to see the video where he specifically mentions that. 

Also, her description of the "Cinderella" story is complete BS as well -- Vonnegut told that one as a goddamn joke in the lecture! It was supposed to show how fucked up Western values are! Did everyone take stupid pills? The clip had a very simple message that is now being bastardized and whored out for social media likes. I can't stand how dumb the Internet is sometimes. |-| 
|-| cogv2mt || 3 || This was published as a chapter in KV's book, Man Without A Country. |-|

What does this mean? I don't have trouble distinguishing bad stuff from good stuff. |-| 
|-| cogpozs || -10 || I hate to be this guy, but this ridiculous Kurt Vonnegut post has shown up on this sub something like 300 times. It was mildly amusing the first time. It's tedious by now. I await my downvotes. |-| 
|-| cogv21r || -5 || it's amazing that he was discovering all this before people started really studying writing. A story starts, then there's a complicating event that creates challenges for the protagonist to overcome (or not to). |-| 
|-| cogescl || 15 || I do love Librivox, and I am thankful for the volunteers and their efforts. That being said, the quality of the recordings, and the capabilities of the readers range from not so great to excellent. 

Still, a tremendous resource.  |-| 
|-| cogqmfp || 5 || Thank you for this link -- it's exactly the sort of volunteer project I was looking for. |-| 
|-| cogs9u6 || 3 || Please list some books that were read well. I listen to audiobooks often, but can't continue with readers that don't bring life to the it, professionals at times included. |-| 
|-| cogvjlg || 3 || My only issue with Librivox is that I wish we could rate books based on the narrations. That way books and chapters with poor ratings can be redone. I've listened to some great ones and love the service, but then you get somebody doing awful mispronunciations or practically mumbling the entire chapter and it makes it difficult at best to enjoy.  |-| 
|-| cogj7nq || -4 || The recordings would still be copyrighted, so be careful using them for anything other than your own pleasure. |-| 
|-| cogtgxl || 31 || This would do so much better as an anime.  There is enough hair pulling, guy/girls misunderstanding, and awkward violence to put a teenager slice of life drama to shame. |-| 
|-| cogone6 || 7 || And I cant seem to find a way to watch it :( |-| 
|-| cogy77f || 4 || I'm pretty sure they'll never make this show. The pilot was just a trick to keep the rights to the WoT material. Ofcourse I'm not 100% certain of this, but it'd make more sense considering the crappy production, god-awful time of airing, stale acting and poor writing (I didn't count, but Lews Therin must say Iliana's name  approx. 20 times). |-| 
|-| cogsfff || 13 || I love Wheel of Fortune. |-|

I'm a self-confessed YA lover so I pay a lot of attention to the YA list, and it just feels like the same 8 books switching spots, with 2 spaces for authors who just released a book. I think this type of system kills exposure for newer authors who actually need it, as opposed to, say, John Green again (and again and again and again).    |-|

|-| cogbw4i || 10 || Perks of Being A Wallflower. I feel like it's one of those books you almost have to read at the right time in your life or else it won't resonate as much, and I did. It opened up a new way of thinking about things for me. |-| 
|-| cogaqm8 || 7 || The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini. We had to read it before freshman seminar in college. Between the imagery and emotions, I couldn't put this book down. Such a powerful story. It's what got me interested in reading again.  |-| 
|-| cogbxdu || 6 || Harry Potter, I can't recall reading anything else during my teenage years. Once I hit my twenties I got interested in reading again - and I think I'm making up for the 'lost years' pretty well compared to most of my peers. :)  |-| 
|-| coge7gj || 5 || Silence of the lambs.  |-| 
|-| cogf9wz || 5 || A Tale of Two Cities. It gave teenage me a lot of much needed perspective and the ending made me discover emotions that I didn't even know I had. |-| 
|-| cogbmsx || 12 || Oh definitely Hitchhiker's Guide.  |-| 
|-| cogbs6l || 6 || Dharma Bums by Jack Kerouac |-| 
|-| cogddn7 || 4 || dragonlance series. I wanted to be Sturm. |-| 
|-| cogoqhu || 4 || The Bell Jar 

Prozac Nation.  |-| 
|-| cogc6tz || 7 || A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin. I could relate to the main character, who was marked with a shadow of doubt and insecurity by thinking he had it all together, then was struck down by forces he really didn't understand. His journey trying to rid his life of the soul-sucking shadow was my life, in some ways. Plus magic, sailing ships and perhaps one of the inspirations for Hogwarts in the Roke school of Wizardry. |-| 
|-| cogi9f1 || 3 || All the books? I've always been a huge reader. I think if I had to choose one, *Rebecca* by Daphne du Maurier, or possibly something by Oscar Wilde...nothing actually written for YA. (Unless you count *To Kill A Mockingbird* but I'm not sure if it became my favorite until I was older.)

Edit: I am a liar, I forgot *A Wrinkle in Time* and *Chronicles of Narnia* which have been favorites I read repeatedly since I was a little girl.  |-| 
|-| cogl85v || 4 || Lord of the Rings, although I also was a big Jack Vance fan. |-| 
|-| cogykfg || 3 || I probably read about ten books a month through my teen years, so at first I thought it would be impossible to even name a favourite book let alone remember why it was a favourite. But after a while two books kept popping up. 

The first was *Lord of the Rings*. A friend loaned it to me and I read it one summer holiday. I can still remember how it sent shivers down my spine. I loved the sense of adventure, and now looking back over the decades (I'm in my fifties) I can see I have been on various Tolkien-type quests (such as cycling through Asia, living in other parts of the world, etc.). 

The second was a large volume of Sherlock Holmes short stories. I was totally immersed from the start, and couldn't read them quickly enough. Nor could I get enough of them. I found myself (as with *Lord of the Rings*) in a world in which I longed to live. And once again I can see the impact these stories have had on my life (I love to research, track things down, play detective).  |-| 
|-| cogbpxp || 10 || Ender's Game.  It's such a great read.  Too bad about the movie. |-| 
|-| cogcx4j || 5 || Slaughterhouse-5 by Kurt Vonnegut. Is that cliche? I don't care. 

I read that novel and was hooked on Vonnegut. It's only been in the past few years that I've stopped saying that he's my favorite author, but he's still way the hell up there.

The reason why I liked it in high school was that it was subversive, strange, funny, compassionate and difficult to fully understand. Plus, I think that at heart, I've always been an old-fart like Kurt. |-| 
|-| cogazs0 || 3 || Anything and everything by Ray Bradbury.  Especially the Martian Chronicles.  It was all so profound to teenage me! |-| 
|-| coght0z || 3 || The Power of One  |-| 
|-| cogj6n5 || 3 || Stranger in a strange land.  I need to read it again to see if I still like it now that I'm an old fart.  |-| 
|-| cogk0fp || 3 || On the Road, or Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas.  |-| 
|-| cogm5xy || 3 || I'm a teenager now. So probably... Honestly, I really don't know. I'm usually really into the book I'm reading, then I'll be enticed into another realm of literature when I pick up something else. So my answer will be biased. This week I'd have to say Cryptonomicon, next week it will probably be something different. |-| 
|-| cogbydh || 3 || Catch 22.  Incidentally, it's still my favorite book now. The first time I read it I had chills when I got to some of the end scenes and I was very emotionally affected. I read it again every few years or so and I always find something new that I missed the previous time.   |-| 
|-| cogb1qs || 9 || Ulysses. I can never get past 50 pages or so. |-| 
|-| cog9czh || 6 || Came here to post Gravity's Rainbow. Great writing that's a total trip to read, but I some 150 pages in and then I always get intimidated by density x size factor. |-| 
|-| coge1c1 || 5 || Somehow, I have no idea how, I've managed to be reading *All Quiet on the Western Front* for almost 10 years now. And I do know it's not even long or hard to read, that's what makes it so ridiculous. |-| 
|-| cog92kr || 4 || I love Murakami. But it took me four tries and three years to finally read Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. And I have done the exact same thing with 1Q84.

I get 100 pages in, I put it down for a couple of months for one reason or another, and then I can't just jump back in. Get 200 pages in, put it down. I got 1Q84 the week it came out in the United States and it still has a bookmark in it, mocking me. |-| 
|-| coga08l || 4 || Foucault's Pendulum. I've started it I think 3 times and never finished the first chapter. I am determined though - someday I will pick it up when I'm in the right mood and power on through. |-| 
|-| cogfx1s || 3 || Dune... sadly enough |-| 
|-| cogjlym || 3 || I've been "currently reading" Moby-Dick for about five years now. So, that.

I always start off by breezing through the first couple hundred pages, lose steam, pick up something else, come back months later deciding I should start over for full effect...And the cycle continues. Furthest I've made it is about 450 pages (and my edition has 600 pages). I don't know why I can't power through to the end when I get so close...Especially since I actually love and enjoy the book. I just can't catch the damn whale. 

Other books I have similar issues with: The Castle (Kafka) and Dead Souls (Gogol).

Edit: Oh, and my reading of In Search of Lost Time has been hampered by how little I like the first section of the third volume (I've heard others express a similar sentiment too). |-| 
|-| cogegl3 || 5 || American Gods.  I don't even hate it.  I just pick it up, go to my mark, and then am just kind of like 'eh fuck it' and go outside or something. |-| 
|-| cogasz2 || 3 || **The Brothers Karamazov**

The scope, the details, the names. It's all too much for me, I just can't keep track of it and taking a break to come back to it just means I forgot what little I had managed to remember. |-| 
|-| cog9msw || 3 || The hobbit, dont know why |-| 
|-| cog8oli || 3 || I have read Red Dragon and Hannibal.  I absolutely loved both of them.  I haven't gotten around to reading Silence of the Lambs yet, but it is on my list. |-| 
|-| cog9fwt || 3 || This is one of my favorite books. I reread it occasionally. I agree it's beautifully written and like it better than SOTL, but that's just me. I recommend Black Sunday as well. |-| 
|-| cog8f8g || -3 || Beautifully? No. Is it good? Yes, far superior to most other books in the genre. Red Dragon is a great read. |-| 
|-| cogkscd || 10 || The Discworld series is light, funny and very easy to get through. If I'm feeling down or need something quick to pick up, I know that I can't go wrong with Terry Pratchett.  |-| 
|-| cogkt6f || 4 || Anything by Nora Roberts. She's the only "romance" author I actually like every single one of the books by her I've read.  |-| 
|-| cogthrx || 3 || I enjoy Francesca Lia Block's YA magical realism. The Weetzie Bat series never lets me down when I need a good dose of fluff! |-| 
|-| cogkg5k || 3 || Tamora Pierce, kids fantasy but I love it.  |-| 
|-| cogyfzn || -5 || Do we need another thing to feed the campus rape hysteria? Also, he talked to rape victims, and those women said certain things. Because rape or sexual assault is an exclusively female issue. It would be interesting if this book was actually objective, instead of just going with the already created narrative.  |-| 
|-| cog7wpn || 5 || I usually go for a hike with my hammock and a book. Half way though, I set up and read. Then walk back. Best afternoons ever |-| 
|-| cog0yn5 || 3 || [The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing](http://www.dspguide.com/) by Steven W. Smith is one of my favorites. |-| 
|-| cog8ev8 || 3 || Ian McEwan's *Atonement*. I really am not sure how long I've had this book, but it has been there on my shelf for a very long time. I finally gave it a read few weeks back. I'm really glad I didn't read it any time sooner. I would have most probably put it down. Between getting the book (If I remember right,it actually belonged to my mom, she had given it to me while I was in high school. Don't think she had read it either 'cause the book felt virgin) and reading it, I had read quite a lot of books, which I feel in a way prepared to me absorb the book to the fullest I can and I also don't think I would have felt the depth of this book had I read it while high school. This is one of my all time favorites! Not so much for the plot, but for its excellent prose and exploration of human emotions. |-| 
|-| cogauth || 3 || Loved "Birds Without Wings"--I'm glad you were finally able to read it and didn't toss it! It's intense but has such beautiful images (like the title).  |-| 
|-| cogen4n || 3 || *Ulysses*. The paperback copy I have cost me 75 pence new in 1972. I tried reading it, twice. Finally, I read the first sixteen chapters (of eighteen) between June and September 2009. I read the last two chapters in early 2011. 

Time between first purchase and completion of reading: 39 years. Worth it in the end? Definitely.

I don't care about physical copies of books – I usually give them away when I've finished with them – but I'd be sorry to lose this this one. |-|
