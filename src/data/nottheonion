Also, given that Kyle was a ridiculous liar, one has to wonder how much of the story was true.

What's great about his film is it will bring out many many people from all political backgrounds and show us this is what war does to a families both here and over there.

If you payed attention during the movie or read the book you would see that he was not content just sitting by and watching the other brave men and women do all the work. He disobeyed direct orders from is CO and went down to clear building with the marines he was protecting because that's the best way he could do it. In the end, even though he didn't die in combat, he died protecting the men he fought along side and it makes me sick that you people are bashing him and others that have died so you could have the right to say the things you are saying. It wrong. Upvotes be dammed, I will speak my mind and say fuck all of you.

From my personal experience with how the military operates (Navy) as well as all the stories from my friends who have been in every branch but the Air Force, there is no way in HELL they would ever let someone talk to their wife on the phone while going out outside the wire. If the movie is anything like the trailer, I'm sure it is an unrealistic piece of crap that demeans the experiences of real people who went through real trauma by exaggerating or misrepresenting the story of some guy who sold his story to Hollywood heathens (no offense to heathens) because he was too dumb and irresponsible to get his shit together after the war.

|-| cnu47j1 || 324 || I enjoyed the movie.  At the same time I don't think it glorified war or Chris Kyle nearly as much as people claim.  It portrayed him as flawed and obsessed more with war than doing what was right for his family.  It practically beat you over the head with it.  And the movie definitely didn't let his black and white views of duty stand unopposed.

And the action scenes, even with the Hollywood plot, didn't really glorify the action happening on screen.  Hell, isn't the first thing they show him dealing with is the kid and woman with the grenade?  There was nothing glorious about that.

Hell, the most 'ooo rah!' thing in the movie was his father's dumbass sheepdog speech at the beginning, and by the end you are practically blaming his douchebag father for molding the main character into who he was.

I'm pretty damn liberal and this movie wasn't nearly as bad as people are making it out to be.  The best thing I can suggest is to not watch it with preconceived notions of what it is going to be.  I didn't even realize it was controversial until after I had seen it.

That said, I do think Bradley Cooper did a hell of a job.  I think he deserves a nomination for it.  Although, overall, I don't think the movie itself deserves one. |-|

|-| cnu5x30 || 5 || A movie about a sniper could be incredibly insightful. Unlike most soldiers, a sniper cannot help but be aware of the personal responsibility of every life taken. When not in an active combat scenario, a sniper probably studies and watches potential targets for a relatively long period of time in an intimate fashion not possible for others.

Flip these around and it's the reason snipers are often reviled by their enemies. Except for the case of a sniper, it can be hard to pinpoint a particular other person to blame for the death of a comrade and/or friend in the chaos that war elicits.

Using these themes, an audience could be far more enlightened about the psychological toll incurred by the training, actual taking, and personal reflections on the taking of life than may be possible in a typical war movie. I think this is especially the case because a sniper can in some ways represent the non-war-going public, being more immune to retribution than the average soldier, while watching and causing death from afar.

If I believed American Sniper were more like this I would see it. But watching [trailer 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99k3u9ay1gs) and [trailer 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bP1f_1o-zo) it comes across more about the personal cost associated with having to make hard choices when one's sense of duty and morality potentially conflict in situations of incomplete information that necessitate quick decisions.

I don't want to make light of this man's story without actually knowing much of it, but that can be achieved (1) in most war movies, (2) without putting in the trailer "deadliest american sniper in history. It seems like it veers more towards tragic hero worship, than a movie with a balanced statement on war. For that reason I will not be seeing it in theaters.

Having not seen it, it's hard for me to say if Rogen is wrong to make the comparison to a fake Nazi hero glorification propaganda film, but it does appear to have too many surface similarities for my taste. |-|

If anything, it shows how much it fucking sucks for the guys that are away from their families and the mental toll it takes on them when they pull the trigger. I don't think 98% of the people on Reddit bashing this film have even seen American Sniper.  |-|

Being a grunt doesn't attract the best and brightest, but I don't think they are unusually dumb. They are just as dumb as the rest of the population, which just makes them human. It's up to us other humans to protect them, and every other dumb lot of us.

It's why humans form societies, it's why we aren't still nomads on the tundra/steppe, we're supposed to be looking out for each other.

Soldiers kill for us, but we should be making sure they aren't dying for us-- these means opposing our pre emptive wars, conducting ourselves honorably by following conventions (like not torturing) so no enemy has justifications for calling us brutal, and not celebrating the brutality of war. |-|

That said, I saw "American Sniper" yesterday, and overall it was a very neutral film.  I went to see it in part because I was looking for answers to how to live with guilt, even though I'm not a veteran, and I was a bit surprised at how the film really offers no answers at all.  Whether you are "pro-gun" or "anti-gun", you see what you want to see in this film.  That's probably why it's selling so well.

To call it a propaganda movie is strange, since it's about someone who gets so messed up in the head he almost loses his family -- and then is killed by another veteran he's trying to help.  Perhaps it's my existing beliefs speaking, but there is no way I'd ever want to go to war, after having seen this.  Your life could be over in the blink of an eye, from someone a mile away -- or in the next car over.  Even if you survive with all your limbs intact, and your wife doesn't leave you, you're probably not going to be able live a normal life back home.  This is not like any propaganda war film I've ever heard of.  There are no winners here.

I would agree that the film did seem to spend too much time on battlefield scenes, and not enough on his recovery back home.  The battle scenes were not fun movie action scenes, though.  They were tense and terrifying.  I was reminded of "Platoon", another film that doesn't exactly take a position, but is generally regarded as an anti-war film.

Compare "Black Hawk Down" or "Pearl Harbor", both of which portrayed, to me, a story of "American forces get an ass-whooping, and then eke out one tiny positive moment at the end, which becomes a celebration of America Fuck Yeah".  Those are propaganda movies.  Big catchy soundtrack at the end to let you know that America won, even if they lost!  "American Sniper" is nothing like those movies, and is better for it.  It ends in dead silence, and the whole theatre afraid to make a sound.

To see "American Sniper" as a propaganda movie, you either have to have your mind made up ahead of time, or you have to be looking to create controversy.  It's a film that should inspire in any sane person a great fear of war, and pity for our veterans. |-|

Imagine if there was an Iraqi film called Iraqi Sniper about a soldier that had over 160 confirmed kills of invading American Soldiers, and the plot of the film was how killing put a strain on his home life, which is depicted as a greater tragedy than the dozens of men he killed.

I knew the Chris Kyle story before there were even ramblings about a movie being made.  If he was still alive, his main message to audiences would have been to actively get involved in helping and being there for those guys who come home with lasting medical conditions.  Look at old videos of his interviews.  That's was his main focus.  

War is fucking hell....and the majority of people(including myself) probably would break down if we went through what most soldiers did/had to see or worse.

In my opinion, it's a *very* conservative movie, which isn't surprising, given that Clint Eastwood is the director. 

I would have preferred to see Chris Kyle presented in a neutral way, if possible. You can have ultra-conservative/liberal main characters that work if they're humanized. *American Sniper* doesn't feel like a character study. It plays directly into the American conservative ethos, whereas similar movies from the past few years (*The Hurt Locker* and *Zero Dark Thirty* in particular) stood on the sidelines. That's why it's alienating people. It's a very well made movie, but it's not one that everyone will agree with.  |-| 
|-| cnud91j || 14 || It's easy for us to say shit about this film and Chris Kyle. 

Truth is, the majority haven't been in a war zone, he classed them all as 'savages' but when in a place where mothers send their child out with explosives, people beat, rape and murder innocent people you start to think differently. 

All of a sudden you realise "Oh shit I'm in a fucking war zone where people actually want to kill me" you do anything to make sure not just you but everyone around you gets back to their children, wives, husbands, mums, dads, brothers and sisters. 

I'm not saying it was a bit weird how it didn't phase him that much killing people, but as someone who grew up next to the SAS base here in England, with several friends, special and normal forces. it does take a special breed of person some will say "Oh fuck this isn't for me" and some will enjoy doing what they do. he did not at any point say he enjoyed killing people. 

You don't have to like these types of people but don't start saying how much of a dick they are, they do a job, a job that is required. Maybe him labelling everyone as a savage was his way of dealing with what he was tasked with doing.  |-| 
|-| cnudkov || 4 || Chris kyle is/was a douchebag and a pretty deplorable person. Not because he killed enemy combatants and gave a shit about the boys in uniform, but because he was a shithead racist, a douchebag conservative, a pathological liar, and apparently a "real" murderer. In his book he states that he literally killed Americans for "looting".


But regardless of these facts, is it possible to enjoy this film as a work of fiction about a solider who's smoldering with awful emotions and is conflicted with feelings about the war and civilian life?


idk, but I'll find out soon. |-|

Although I don't think it was a good comparison, I do not believe that it was Rogen's intent to compare american snipers to nazis and the film to the nazi propaganda. Think about it, Rogen is a simple-minded guy, you really think he's gonna make a claim that small and have something so subtle have such a deep meaning? I don't think so. |-|

|-| cnum2qs || 15 || I'm a former Marine who just saw the film today. Being completely honest and forthcoming, Rogan's assesment is correct. I personally didn't like the film. Early on when I was in we (junior Marines) were asked by a higher up to say why we joined. Very few, and I mean like 3 out of the 50 in the room said they joined for, "love of country," or to, "protect family." Most reasons were for free college or to have a job that pays you to stay in great physical shape (a rarity now a days). The film just didn't sit well with me, it moved too quickly and skimmed over Chris Kyle's personal (PTSD) issues. |-| 
|-| cnum5em || 44 || I know this is an oniony story, but I am irked at how many 'I don't have enough money' claims are made on reddit and how this story mirrors them. 

Look - to each his own. I've lived more than half of my life, have enough to support me and my family without working again, and to enjoy life. I also struggled, and even when making very little and working a lot I saved and saved.

This family made choices - five kids, private schools and so on, but the core issue isn't the money or the things. It is the happiness. They clearly can't be happy working that hard and still feeling as if they've failed (not getting what you think you deserve is close enough for me).

**Enjoy what you have.** Save for tomorrow. Enjoy when the investments pay your salary and you can vacation and not worry about a checkbook balancing. Live today - you could be dead tomorrow - but plan for tomorrow. It comes sooner than you think it will. Don't think you need the palace... It is never "enough" and you will quickly want more. Last - you can't take any of it with you, and the kids don't want your old crap.

|-| cnup0gs || 3 || It's a Christian symbol, not satanic at all

"There are many connections between the pentagram and Christianity. Before the cross, it was a preferred emblem to adorn the jewelry and amulets of early Christians (followed by an ‘x’ or a phoenix). The pentagram was associated with the five wounds of Christ, and because it could be drawn in one continuous movement of the pen, the Alpha and the Omega as one.

A ‘point down’ pentacle is nothing new, nor is it necessarily Satanic when it appears as such. Historical depictions of the pentagram were as likely to be points down as point up; a distinction between one or the other was rarely made by the ancients.

Perhaps most curious is the pentagram as it relates to early Christianity. Constantine the Roman Emperor who converted to Christianity chose to use the pentagram on his seal and amulet. Up until medieval times, the five points of the pentagram represented the five wounds of Christ on the Cross. During these times the pentagram carried no evil implications at all and in fact, in a lesser way than the cross, was symbolic of the Savior."

Their numbers are seriously off - there are only one or two specialists who could ever make $200k a year per day of the week worked, so I think they are greatly exaggerating the ease of income.  Memberships in associations are annual.  Their travel budget is $2000 per month? $24000 per year?  Uh... maybe stay in a 4 star?

Combined with my wife have a similar combined salary to what is reported (sorry, i'm not comfortable with exact numbers), and i have no financial issues or struggles.  I've paid off most of a massive student debt ($240k at graduation, plus $60k in national student loans), bought and done major renovations to my apartment, bought a car, travelled twice a year.  I've now been working 5 years since graduating (with the aforementioned $300k debt).

I have room to save money, to donate to important causes to me, to cover incidentals if needed, to make payments to all of my insurances.  

Vancouver IS an expensive place to live, no doubt.  But if you're struggling financially at $400k/year, you have major issues. |-|

Your taxes are incrediblyhigh, you get 0 benefits from the government and the typical 100-240k job has you working like a dog, you can't see your family and you can't really afford any luxuries.  I know a lot of friends who got divorced after just a few years at this level.   Life doesn't really get good until after 500k.  You can afford luxuries and still save.  Your up high enough that you can take time off as needed, and your skilled enough that you don't need to worry about working hard since it's your job to make decisions, not to work. |-|

When is enough punishment enough?  If the goal is to reintegrate excons into society, at what point do we begin to treat them like normal members of society?  

I mean, yeah, what this guy did is deplorable but he did his time and, at least from what's given in this story, he's trying to improve his life and move on.  Don't we want him gainfully employed?  Don't we want him to be able to make a living that doesn't involve crime?  

I don't know what the exact right answer is, but acting like it's a big funny joke that he wants to have his monitor removed is really diminishing the seriousness of it all.  20 years ago he committed a horrible crime.....he hasn't done anything since (as far as is reported here); we need to either forgive him and allow him to live as a normal person, or we need to admit that we refuse to and just kill him.  This pathetic charade of "we're going to treat you like an animal but claim moral superiority" only makes the situation worse.

How about you guys use the word properly instead of diluting its meaning and calling everyone a rapist:

Post to a non-approved subreddit?  **Rapist**.

Make negative comment about Sarkeesian?  **Rape enabler** and **rape apologist**.

Think that women should know how to cook and shouldn't be obese?  Patriarchal **rape culture** enabling misogynist neckbeard.

You play violent video games?  **Schrodinger's rapist**.

See?  Overuse the word and it becomes white noise.

|-| cnvngvf || 5 || The purpose of prison SHOULD be to rehabilitate criminals to be functioning and productive members of society, NOT to continually punish criminals beyond the terms of their imprisonment. As much as everyone may be disgusted by a rapist or a murderer, if he serves his sentence then that should be the extent of his punishment. Anything more is a malfeasance, an emotional outcry culminating in a moral crusade. Depriving people of the ability to begin a new life, for selfish reasons, is just as evil as whatever acts that person may have committed. 

We have the technology to track and monitor an individual without violating their privacy rights, and without making any attempts at rehabilitation fruitless. This man wants a monitor which does not complicate his ability to connect with people in the public sphere, then he should have it. This circlejerk I see in the comments demonstrates exactly why he should be allowed his privacy - Redditors, at the very least, are more than happy to deprive him of his rights.

Chen isn't saying Netflix should be required to make a BlackBerry App, he's saying if BlackBerry codes a Netflix app by the same standards as competitors, Netflix shouldn't be permitted to just block it and demand a dump truck of money to unlock it (Which is similar to what Verizon did to Netflix). A similar case is when Microsoft was taken to court for monopolistic practices regarding web browser software, specifically that it had tweaked Windows APIs to intentionally degrade the performance of competitors vs Internet Explorer.

Chen's argument may seem self-serving but he raises an interesting point: a logical step past arguing for open transport layers is to argue for open application frameworks.  |-|

He's a hypocritical asshole, but he's not wrong.

Take the 2008 housing collapse for example. It's easy to blame the banks (rightfully so), but let's not forget about the countless people who purchased houses they knew *damn well* they cannot afford. "My mortgage payment will be double my salary in 8 years? Meh, future me will figure it out. Present me is getting a pool!"

Or how about the girl everyone knows that makes $12/hr as a manager in *Sears* and spends $500 on a Louis Vuitton bag instead of starting a savings account?

Or the frat boy that maxes out 3 credit cards to buy a brand new *Mustang* to impress his buddies?

Americans are masters of living outside their means.

|-| cnxrine || 9 || &gt; **Many people**, Dana Kennedy said, were of the opinion that **Jews had staged** the series of deadly terror incidents to make Muslims look bad...

&gt; “**One person** told me that they weren’t just regular Jews that were doing this but in fact but **a race of magical shape-shifting Jews** that were master manipulators that could be everywhere at the same time,” Kennedy said.

Headline is badly misleading - one random weirdo (or possibly just a troll referencing Borat) blamed it on magical shape-shifting Jews, but the headline would have you believe that it was a widespread or credible belief amongst French-Algerians in Paris.

To be fair it's not exactly reasonable to believe the Charlie Hebdo attack was a false-flag conducted by even regular, *non-*shape-shifting Jews, but it's several orders of magnitude less crazy than the theory the headline would have you *believe* a large number of Muslims questioned were happy to agree with. |-|

Being able to budget and knowing what you can afford or not is paramount to any wealth.

I often times see people jokingly commenting "Oh if I had a fortune like "x" I could totally do "y" all day every day". Yes mate, but if you did you probably wouldn't have "x"'s fortune, and even if you did you'd probably not have it for long. |-|

&gt;Olivia, my eldest daughter, caught measles when she was seven years old.

&gt;As the illness took its usual course I can remember reading to her often in bed and not feeling particularly alarmed about it. Then one morning, when she was well on the road to recovery, I was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldn’t do anything.

&gt;“Are you feeling all right?” I asked her.

&gt;“I feel all sleepy, ” she said.

&gt;In an hour, she was unconscious. In twelve hours she was dead.

&gt;The measles had turned into a terrible thing called measles encephalitis and there was nothing the doctors could do to save her. |-| 
|-| cogdybz || 147 || That is the dumbest thing I read today on the internet. Measles are not like the chickenpox. They are not only endangering their own children but also every other child they get in contact with. DON'T DO THIS! How can people be this crazy irresponsible. |-|

|-| cogeklc || 48 || I had measles as a child because way back then there was no vaccine.  Many of the parents of the measles party kids probably have been vaccinated and aren't autistic and never had to bear having measles.  My cousin got the measles the same time my brother and I did and he lost his hearing permanently.
I know this is a difficult topic fraught with chasm-like potholes filled with disbelief, science denial, people upset with a government that outright lies to us about plenty, foolish politicians who have not an ounce of leadership, paid pundits who will say anything for a buck and a study that was discredited.  
We have more information and less knowledge these days.  While researchers try to find reasons for and cures for conditions it seems to me the statistics are more with you than against you as far as vaccines.  My own grandchild is autistic and was on a delayed vaccination schedule due to my daughter's concerns.  His autism showed up well before any of his vaccinations started.

&gt;He sparked widespread outrage after emailing other rabbis to say it should be up to them to decide whether a paedophile should be reported.

&gt;The rabbi also said that, where possible, allegations of abuse should be dealt with outside the legal system.

Great idea! I mean it worked out so well for the catholic church... |-| 
|-| cog2x18 || 4 || Actually read the article, and I kind of see where he is coming from. We have recently decided that in cases of sexual misconduct allegations, people are guilty even if proved innocent. As mentioned elsewhere in the thread, a child misunderstanding a totally acceptable situation could completely ruin someone's life if reported before any follow-up.

This Rabbi also send like a nincompoop. |-| 
|-| cogdvcj || 4 || Did you know these filthy rabbis put the penis of freshly circumcised boys in their mouths, and suck the blood out of it? This has resulted in many cases of infant herpes, even to the point of murdering the baby.

|-| cogfyca || -4 || Sounds like a way of life that differs from modern-western views. Perhaps this article purposely tries to make him look evil; I'm not buying it.

Funny enough, I thought this was a reference to circumcision. |-| 
|-| coga83e || 23 || Oh wow!  It ended almost exactly like how we thought it would. A cash grab! Well it was either that or she started murdering people for him so I am glad it was the less murderous of the 2 scenarios that played out. |-| 
|-| cogenwf || 14 || That's so much less insane than wanting to marry him because she likes him. |-| 
|-| cognjkj || 11 || Alternate headline: Charles Manson meets a woman who's too crazy for him. |-| 
|-| cog9wnb || 9 || Fuck them both |-| 
|-| cog9j3x || 6 || That reads like it was written by a four year old. Interesting article though. |-| 
|-| cogc8qu || 5 || Man, and I thought they'd be together forever.  |-| 
|-| cogbtoj || 4 || Dat ash. |-| 
|-| cogpkz6 || 3 || http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/charles-manson-wedding-off-after-it-emerges-that-girlfriend-afton-elaine-burton-just-wanted-his-corpse-for-display-10034793.html this one has a much better title. |-| 
|-| cogd6s6 || 9 || Neil Armstrong basically stole Government office supplies and didn't get caught.  |-| 
|-| cogbv63 || 4 || If this was from the onion it would include, "According to officials, the artifacts were found neatly tucked between a Swiffer wet-jet and a box of old yearbooks" |-| 
|-| cogt3hc || 6 || I worked briefly in the industry,  and the vast majority of the people are extremely uneducated and are as blue-collar as it gets. That manager has probably been promoted by incompetence (peter principle) so many times, and finally got a slap on the wrist.  It's super hard to get fired and when I was applying for jobs,  there were about 300 applicants to an opening,  he will probably get promoted just before he retires 6 month later (they used to just promote and retire, but then they made it illegal) with 120% pension |-| 
|-| cogtqpa || 6 || While that's rather unpleasant to think of, it likely had no distinguishable adverse effects on the water quality when it was that heavily diluted. |-| 
|-| cogb25h || 18 || "Wild bull" is what the Bible says. Someone's translation ended up with "unicorn". |-| 
|-| cogbx6k || 12 || Only the biblical versions descended from the King James Edition say Unicorn, so of course this Southern Baptist group doesn't know that. In the earlier versions those passages are a parable about the oxen not wanting to obey the will of man and how that relates to man and his not wanting to obey God. But since when has Ken Hamms idiotic website ever cared about doing their research before they declare the unquestionable word of God. |-| 
|-| cogymcv || 8 || now that's what I call..... *a sticky situation*. |-| 
|-| cogtmbo || 6 || At first I wished this to be in Canada. Then I remembered that Canadians would face a serious conundrum here. Calling the police would be impolite to those running the alleged methlab. Not doing so would possibly be against the law. I'd assume they'd simply do nothing and move on with an "Eh". |-| 
|-| cogugtf || 4 || Why can't there be more stories like this? Of police calmly investigating a situation without anyone getting hurt. |-| 
|-| cogpxkw || 3 || I have driven about 4,000 miles since new years day. That's twice my normal rate. Road trips are irresistible with a 30 MPG car and gas at $2.50 a gallon. Tires, brakes and oil changes aren't cheaper  though.  |-| 
|-| cogsqei || 3 || The real joke is that this is an article.
Seriously,  do they not know what elastic demand is? |-| 
|-| cogjh0v || 3 || i'm stocking up now while it's cheap and keeping it in milk jugs in my garage |-| 
|-| cogj9l2 || 3 || We can claim individual freedom all we want, but driving more and buying low MPG vehicles is dumb when the same people have tens of thousands in debt and pollution is in no one's best interests.  |-| 
|-| cogq4x6 || 15 || Misleading title and bad reporting.  I read through another six articles reporting this same story and they all say the baby was "pregnant" and that "the fetuses were attached to a placenta" and described the phenomena as fertilized eggs ending up in the wrong womb.  I can just picture the pro-birthers everywhere being outraged haha

Anyway, here's a wiki on what actually happens:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus_in_fetu  |-| 
|-| cogo3xp || 4 || Nightmare inducing. |-| 
|-| cogumdd || 3 || I wonder how people against abortions would feel about the doctors removing the two fetuses.  |-| 
|-| coguuw4 || 3 || How is babby formed? |-| 
|-| coh212g || 38 || Just got a phone call from a girl saying Im going to die in seven days. Weird.  |-| 
|-| cogzot4 || 27 || Well, I wont get that time back... |-| 
|-| coh2ai3 || 13 || Well Quentin Jones seems like a pretentious wanker  |-| 
|-| coh23xx || 86 || Miley Cyrus gets naked and licks a sledge hammer and it's "sexy" and "artistic". I go do the exact same thing and I'm "wasted" and "have to leave Home Depot". |-| 
|-| coh2af9 || 6 || Yolandi Visser wannabe.
 |-| 
|-| coh24i7 || 4 || I've never had "porn" make me so nervous.   |-| 
|-| coh04n4 || 6 || Their definition of porn does not match mine. Same for 'sexy'. |-| 
|-| coh21wi || 13 || Because he has such a solid history of not lying. |-| 
|-| coh0viq || 13 || How about 'No' |-| 
|-| coh261y || 21 || I know this seems obvious, but the way we do science requires that we reaffirm the obvious; after all, some things that seem obvious aren't actually true.  |-| 
|-| cogy9gs || 7 || "No, Mrs Johnson, two Snickers bars and half a litre of Monster Energy aren't considered suitable lunch items in our pre-school!" |-| 
|-| coh2ber || 7 || In other news, water is wet.  |-| 
|-| coh1v63 || 3 || So...ok...I would hope people already knew this... |-| 
|-| coh26om || 3 || They are literally called energy drinks how hard is that to understand. They give you a kick (of energy), c'mon parents. |-| 
|-| cog8z48 || 7 || Ya don't say? |-| 
|-| coglzh4 || 3 || It's okay, we just need to start making ritalin-infused energy drinks.  |-| 
|-| cog9e4h || 4 || This just in: Salt is salty. |-| 
|-| cog8ckj || 4 || Um. |-| 
|-| cogax88 || 3 || There are people getting *paid* to tell us this...  |-| 
|-| coge7pa || 7 || So if you knowingly bring your kid to one of these parties, and your kid dies, do you get charged with murder? |-| 
|-| cogajpw || 6 || Is it me or are these parents a special kind of stupid? |-| 
|-| cogd770 || 3 || I didn't know this was real thing.  I remember something similar  from a [Southpark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickenpox_%28South_Park%29) episode (in 1998 apparently) but I thought that was just TV.

&gt;Chickenpox begins to spread throughout South Park, and infects Stan's sister Shelley and Kenny. The other boys' mothers begin to think that maybe the other boys should be exposed to it too, so as to get it while they are young and it is easier to deal with. They agree and have the other boys stay over at Kenny's house.  |-| 
|-| cogy0am || 15 || what is oniony about this ? It is just a news story. |-| 
|-| coggbqq || 3 || Erm... do more cyclists kill taxi drivers, or more taxi drivers kill cyclists?

Just asking. |-| 
|-| cogbqva || 3 || Oh, like plenty of high end European manufactures have been doing for many years? 

Click bait to the max with the repost.  |-| 
|-| coh2cwj || 3 || People are fucking stupid. |-|
