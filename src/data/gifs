|-| cntwgb2 || 2113 || Interestingly enough, detailed photographs taken by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) show that five of the six U.S. flags planted on the moon are still standing. Only the first one, set there by Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, happened to be blown down by the lift-off thrust from their lunar lander as it left the moon's surface. However, due to years of exposure to solar radiation, all of the flags are now bleached completely white.

Some argue that the presence of these white flags on the moon conclusively prove that the French were actually there first. |-|

|-| cnu5aai || 28 || this works because the hot water vapor in the bottle takes up more space.  when the front is submerged in cold or room temperature water, it cools down the vapor in the bottle.

Then the inside cools even quicker, and water rushes in faster, until the bottle is almost full. |-|

Gas inside bottle is almost entirely water vapor, when the end is stuck in the bowl of cold water, the water vapor returns to liquid state thus displacing less volume causing a a rapidly increasing vacuum as more water rushes into the bottle. Contrary to gas contracting as it cools, this effect is caused by matter state transition.  |-|

|-| cnujwyg || 6 || Hey!

My Profession is what's called a Rotoscope Artist. I essentially do this sort of thing for a living. Only on a much larger scale.

For Stereoscopic (3D) conversion we trace EVERYTHING in a shot out. EVERY person, EVERY tree, EVERY lamp post, EVERY one of Mila Kunis's freakin hairs. (this is my job)

Here's a random example:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0LrXplHK9s  


Once we've traced everything out we have artists who animate geometry within a scene according to the shot to match our rotoscope.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsBhPRnysA4

Using our rotoscope to mask out the geometry Depth artists then are able to mess with how the shot looks in 3D and we can get depth confirmation from the Movie's Stereographer.

Then we have to paint out EVERYTHING out so you can essentially see "behind" objects in depth, because that information didn't exist in the original plate.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0WHaVF6OI8

Then I get to hear my friends and family complain about 3D movies. |-|

Before one of the shows started, they announced that people had graduated two days before, congratulations to them, and for them to stand up so everyone could see and applaud. 

I must clarify that they asked the graduates to stand up. I, not listening very well, thought they wanted everybody in the stadium to stand up and clap or something. So as i started to rise, i realized that nobody else was and that i was looking really bad. I sat down sheepishly. 

I pretended that i needed to tell my wife something and thats why i stood, so i leaned over to get her attention but she was trying to talk to my aunt. Naturally i just sat there and hoped my brother in law didnt notice. 

I found out later that my wife had also misunderstood the announcement and tried to stand, but stopped and tried to get my aunt's attention |-|

Crack the egg, slowly break it apart above the bowl, rock back and forth so the egg whites fall out (kind of dumping the egg yolk from one half of the shell to the other), then dump the yolk into a separate bowl after all the whites have fallen out.

KAVGA- HATALI SOLLAMA: http://youtu.be/M4jqnrrrd7E |-| 
|-| cnvwzlj || -3 || It's actually quite a sad story. This is my brother as he escaped the mental hospital. Two and a half years before this incident, he lost his wife and only child in a house fire. He completely lost it and ended up kidnapping a little girl, completely convinced it was his own. We set him up with some good psychologists and psychiatrists, but after he did it a second time we had to put him in a 'facility'. It was good for awhile, but he kept trying to break out. This video shoes his first (and last) escape attempt where he actually managed to get outside the building. We had to transfer him to a more secure facility, which was heartbreaking.

He is disoriented a lot of the time, so it wasn't just about who he might hurt. He could easily walk into the street and get run over. In this video, you can see my brother back into the street with cars coming. In the middle of this clip the guy with the dark jacket over the white shirt pushes my brother out of the street because a car is coming. It was really hard for me to see my brother go through that. If you want to learn more about his condition, here is a good [video explanation](http://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ).

Instead of putting an atrium in the middle, they should have just put in quite a lot more floor space. Pretty sure the people living in those flats would rather have 30m² more living space than a depressing bottomless pit outside their window.

The architect should be slapped. |-|

|-| cobt6jv || 3 || I install air conditioning. 
There was one time we used a cherry picker that had a 200kg rating.
We used it to lift a 110kg air conditioner on wall brackets 6m high.
We had to screw timbers on the sides of the cage to make some forks to sit the air conditioner on.
Then two of us got in the cage. I weighed 115kg. The other guy was 140kg. 
We then proceeded to lift the sum total of 365kg with a cherry picker rated at 200kg. 
It stopped half way.
'now what? ', i said.
'Well, if it was gonna tip it would have done it already.' Said my co worker.
'Lets jump up and down and the picker should get there.' Was his next answer.
So here were two grown men, jumping up and down in a cherrry picker, in a back alley in the cbd of Sydney, to allow an overloaded cherry picker to creep an extra 2 or 3 meters in height, to put an air conditioner on brackets.
To this day, i still don't know how it didn't tip over.
I have pushed the boundaries many times in my trade.
But id never do what this guy is doing. |-|

-Someone tries to go out the entrance door, which will not open from the inside, and when I tell them to go out the other door they point at the emergency exit sign and tell me "It says exit!" while they ignore the "Do not enter" signs posted directly at face level

-Someone actually runs into the entrance door that doesn't open from inside when I don't explicitly tell them to use the other door.

-When I direct someone to use the other door, they do what we see in this video here and then look at me accusingly when the non-door glass pane doesn't open. Then they stand in front of each glass pane at the front until they find the actual exit door. |-|

Fast forward to the day we got to throw fucking hand grenades(I was so excited) and he's giving us a class aka death by PowerPoint on proper procedure. Proper grip. Thumb the clip. Twist pull pin. Frag out. 

So were all in line side stepping with our backs on the wall to get handed our grenades. My DS hands the guy in front his grenades then I'm up next. DS looks me in the eyes says "itcouldalwaysbeworse do you wanna be a fucking hero today" pulls the pin and drops it at my feet. 

I literally shit a little in my pants and screamed liked a bitch. The frag goes off and all I can hear is ringing and my heart pounding thru my body. For sure thought I was dead. 

DS laughs and tells me its a simulation grenade. As he hands me my grenades he leans in and whispers "you ever scream like that again I will skull fuck your teeth out" and pushes me down the line.

|-| cobezu5 || 4 || [Here's the source video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsSsSBkaj4M) I made the gif from. From the video description:  
  
"Guests may hear the pitter-patter of little paws splashing in a small pool the next time they visit Brookfield Zoo’s Fragile Rain Forest exhibit. That’s because there is a new addition: a male fishing cat kitten born on October 31, 2014. He has now grown old enough to be seen on exhibit with his 4-year-old mom, Anna."

. . .  


"Fishing cats are endangered in the wild. Once found throughout Asia, they are now found in densely vegetated areas near marshes, mangroves, rivers, and streams in discontinuous areas of the continent, including in Sumatra, Java, southern China, India, and Sri Lanka. The degradation and destruction of wetlands and the depletion of fish stocks pose significant threats to their population, as does hunting for their fur, which is prized on the black market." |-|

|-| cob5cbm || 38 || Apparently this is a relative of mine. He posted it on FB not too long ago. My dad showed it to me and I tired uploading it to reddit but couldn't figure out how to. 

They're in Mexico and they do this a lot from what I'm told. The dog enjoys it and usually runs up to him to do it again. 

**Edit:** Some people are questioning me on this. (I don't know why they're doing it, just the type of people to pop a stick in someone's spokes.) And saying I'm only doing it for the karma is stupid. You can check my post history, I'm not that type of person.

But [here](http://i.imgur.com/TZPK8Nk.png) is the first post I saw of it.

After asking my dad again, the guy IN the video, I'm not related to. The guy who TOOK the video is my dad's uncle and friends with the guy in the video.

The dog's name is Hercules and this is in Texas, NOT Mexico.

|-| cobkyte || 10 || Yeah, it's proven that getting kicked in the nuts hurts waaaay more.  (I should not have said that, I should not have said that.) |-| 
|-| cobwk9t || 3 || Fun fact(s), one reason childbirth hurts so much is because we are bipedal. Our pelvises are, more or less, triangular to support our upper body weight but the birth canal is narrow because of this. There is also an area on the pelvis called the pelvic face where the two hips fused. During childbirth the fuse breaks slightly which contributes to the pain. You can actual tell on a female skeleton how many children she had in her life by looking at the breaks and healing of the pelvic face. A quadruped has square or rectangular hips and a larger birth canal so birth is, in comparison, easier.

|-| cogd5h6 || 4 || Not one but TWO uncomfortable beds! |-| 
|-| cogfmhv || 5 || So much dirty gross shit gets in the crack underneath the cushions on a couch, that bottom matress would be disgusting. 

At least with a pull-out couch, they fold in half so the part you sleep on is in the middle where all the crumbs, car keys, money, lighters, dead hamsters all go into is not the part you sleep on. This one looks like all that nasty build up would go right onto the bottom mattress... No thanks. 

Really cool concept but they need to shield the bottom mattress some how, if they made it pull out like a regular pull out couch I think it would be way better, not only would it protect the nastiness it would also give you a double bed on the bottom and a single bunk on top, so more room for activities.

Just never ask me to carry one of these fuckin things into your apartment, a regular pull out couch weights as much as a car so I could only imagine my idea. 


Oh, yeah I was 100% serious about the dead hamster thing. I remember a friend of mine 15+ years ago lost his hamster and was really bummed out about it, about 2 months later I was looking for the remote for the TV and looked under the cushion and found where good ol' starbie went... I didn't have the heart to tell him he probably sat on and crushed his pal so I told his mom and she took care of it when I brought him downstairs to distract him.

EDIT 1: Apparently, everybody on reddit is a member of PETA. If this were a text post talking about how a negligent mother let a wild bird kill her child right in front of her, everyone would be bashing the mother, calling her a negligent bitch for not defending her child. Why is everyone so quick to defend the life of a dangerous wild bird, that is fucking ATTACKING a small child? Jesus Christ, this community has zero value for human life. |-|

&gt;*Was it nerve-racking to take your clothes off for this movie?*

&gt;No. On screen its two minutes but on set it was twelve hours and twelve hours of constant boob play, I mean it was great for the first three, four or five hours but then, I mean seriously, give a girl a break. But Will was a nice guy about it.

&gt;*So Will was nice when it came to touching your breasts?*

&gt;Definitely. If you have an opportunity for Will to play with your boobs, he’s a master

|-| cogcoyg || 50 || I washed dishes at a Shari's for the better part of a year. Having uniformly clean plates like that is something that just never happens. Often they would have cheese, chocolate or some other sticky substance that you HAD to scrub.  |-| 
|-| cogal7k || 22 || Or, if it were me, how to break dishes. |-| 
|-| coghzir || 15 || having also washed dishes I can confirm this is pretty much how I racked plates. To everyone saying that it's a shitty post because the plates aren't actually dirty and it would take more time to scrub the plates we have a saying where I work. Let the machine do the work. So you may have to send one or two plates back through to get the tough stuff off or yes, god forbid, actually scrub it off but you're still saving a boatload more time than making sure that every piece of cheese, caked on sauce or whatever has been cleaned off before sending it through the industrial machine designed to clean it. |-|
